## Transcript

Woah. It's almost Halloween, and there are some scary, scary ghosts that are going to hunt your quota, Nicholas. Dude, what? I thought we were filming a video today. What are you doing? Why are you wearing your mom's uniform? It's not. I thought this is a Halloween episode. I'm wearing a wrestling single and I'm reliving my glory days. That's that's that's what you said to do. Oh. What are you wearing? Ghost of your quota and this is the chest hair you see in your nightmares. And today, we're going to go through the five scariest ghosts that could haunt your quota From prospecting all the way to close. Nicholas, your first ghost of selling is in discovery. Sometimes your deal will disappear below the surface. And you know why? Because you've only found surface level problems. Okay. So let's explain why surface level problems are scary in discovery. The reason is a lot of times when you get focused on trivial pains or annoyances like, oh, I spend so much time in spreadsheets or it takes me this many clicks to do this thing or it's kind of annoying that I can't look at this dashboard. Those are oftentimes pain points that some very junior person will complain about, but those pain points are not enough to drive a $4.05, 6 figure sales process. And so if you want to close a deal in q four, the key to closing a big deal in q four is you need to find 6 and 7 figure problems that impact the entire business. These are typically emotional problems that freak out someone who's not just an analyst, but they'll oftentimes freak out a VP or a chief financial officer. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright. So let's actually make this real for a product that I sold for a long time, which was billing software to law firms. There are three different layers that I would need to navigate to sell my quarter million dollar product. At the very highest level, the operational problem that we would often hear would be managing bill appeals takes a lot of time. And we would usually hear that from billers at the law firm who were frustrated that there was a lot of back and forth when they sent a bill to their client to actually get that bill paid. Now saving a biller fifteen hours a week, if that biller makes 80 k a year, isn't enough to justify charging a quarter million dollars for our product. The next level to actually get an executive at the law firm to care about this would be to pull it down to an executive level problem, which is typically something that is tied to a revenue target, their p and l, so, like, saving them a significant amount of money, or helping mitigate risk at the law firm level. The way that I would tie bill appeals to something an executive would care about would a lot of times when there were these appeals, the law firm might bill a million dollars, but not be able to collect that million dollars. They might only collect $700,000. And so if I could tie that bill appeals taking a lot of time to having a $300,000 gap in what they had billed, all of a sudden we had a business case for what I was selling. But to really hammer this thing home, I had to go all the way to the depths. And that's where I would go to the business impact of solving this. And typically, the business impact is going to be a c level metric or a big initiative that the org is pursuing. And so for us, what I would have to tie this to would be what is called PPP, profit per partner. If the law firm was missing out on $300,000 every quarter because their bill appeals were messed up, all of a sudden the partners wouldn't be taking home the profit that the firm was supposed to be making, and that is something that would get the managing partner, the CEO of a law firm, to spend money on us immediately. So navigating that in a sales conversation is easier said than done. But I've got two questions that you can use to go from operational to exec problem and exec to business impact. So to go from operational problem to executive problem, I use what's called a multiple choice question. And so the way that would work in practice is the prospect says, yeah, these bill appeals, they're taking forever. They're a huge pain in the butt. We we have to find a more efficient way to do that. Okay. That's something that I'm hearing from a lot of law firms. A lot of folks are saying this is getting worse and worse and worse. I guess, typically, when I hear people are frustrated with bill appeals, it ends up showing up in the business in one of two ways. Way one is, like, you just end up having to hire more billers because this takes just so much work. Or I've heard from some firms that, like, you end up having these appeals and you don't end up collecting on all of the dollars that you end up billing and it ends up hurting the margin on your bill. I guess, is it one of those for you or something else? Now they might take me to yeah. This is this is hurting our collections. Cool. To go all the way to the business impact, here's where I need to get emotional and get them to tell me a story about the problem. And the way that I do that is I use what's called the magic moment question. And so I'll say something to the effect of, you know, I can't imagine that you woke up this morning thinking, man, we've gotta solve this bill appeals issue. I guess, when was the moment that you realized that, like, something probably had to change? And what they'll give me in response is they'll tell me a story about the managing partner pulling them into their office or an executive committee meeting where the partners were pissed because they found out they weren't gonna be taking home the pay they thought they would. That is how I get to business impact and emotional resonance that lets me justify charging a quarter million dollars for my software. Oh, you think you've gotten past the sales, Ghost Nicholas. But that was only the first meeting of Discovery. The next ghost comes in the demo meeting. And this demo meeting isn't a scary monster. It's a ghost that will put you to sleep because your demo is so boring that you fall into a deep hypnosis, and that is when you die. I die? Okay. So let me explain why the hypnosis demo is one of the worst sins in sales. A lot of times people say, discovery is all that matters or it's the most important skill in sales, and that's, like, kind of true. But when I look at most software demos, most sellers take all of the enthusiasm that they generated in discovery, and they completely throw it in the trash. They do two things wrong. Number one, they demo the software instead of demoing the story or the life. Your prospect has been writhing in pain if you've been doing what Nick described correctly. They're writhing in the problem and the impact, and now it's your opportunity to take them to the never never land of this is what life could look like without that stuff. But instead, they literally demo the features as you can click on this dashboard and add this field, and it's the most boring underwhelming thing you could possibly imagine. In other words, your prospect actually loses sight of the problem and the vision that they were hoping to accomplish. That's number one. And then number two, you do this great job of getting your prospect to talk in discovery, and then a lot of sellers spend 90% of a demo talking at the prospect. And everyone knows if there's one way to put someone to sleep, it's to talk at them for 90% of the call. So you have to get them talking throughout the demo. So there are three ways that I like to do that. But first, like and subscribe to pay for these expensive costumes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Number one is the way that I like to start a demo is with the demo deck. There are three slides and no more than three slides that I use to set the stage from discovery into demo. Slide number one is what we heard. What I wanna see is three bullets where each bullet says, problem you said, impact it causes. Problem you said, impact it causes. That's slide one. Slide two is here's how we solve each of those things. You take those three problems and you show this is what your life is gonna look like if you didn't have those problems using us. That's slide two. And then slide number three is a blank slide with their faces on it. And it says, what's on your wish list based on what we've discussed, a k your demo wish list. Now what I wanna hear is based on the problems, the impacts, and the solutions we've talked about, what do you need to make sure that you get out of this demo? And that's your opportunity to get them talking. A lot of times in a demo, you're gonna add new stakeholders to the call. And so now what you've done is you've resurfaced everything you've learned in discovery, and anyone who's new to the call, you can start working the room. You can start saying, hey, Jane. Like, Jimmy over here was saying that manager visibility into compensation decisions was really important. I'm curious, like, would you say that that's the most important thing for you too or is there something else that we missed? And now you can spend a solid five or ten minutes tailoring the discovery or tailoring the demo to the new people who've entered the room. And at this point, you don't want to fatigue them too much. You probably wanna spend maybe ten, fifteen minutes total on the demo deck, and now you can transition to the demo. When you demo, number two, demo in stories, not in features. And so let's say, for example, when I was selling compensation software, one of the things companies would really struggle with is if you had a company with a 100 managers, you had to make sure that all of the managers were making equitable compensation decisions, but it was literally impossible to do that unless you were in all 100 conversations. So instead of saying, this is a place where you can click into every single manager and look at their decisions, I'm gonna tell the story. I'm gonna say, hey, Jimmy. You mentioned in our last call that you spent hours and hours and hours clicking into every single spreadsheet and you were freaking out because you saw Joe, the sales manager, was giving biased promotions to people, whereas Jane, the sales leader, was actually like making sure everything got done right. And so here's what that would look like in Pave instead. In other words, I'm transporting them into the day in the life of the problem and then I'm gonna demo the day in the life in the future. And so I might say, hey, let's pretend that you're inside of Pave tomorrow. The first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna wake up and you're gonna be able to see every single manager, and you're gonna know for sure which managers are making comp decisions within your guidelines and outside of your guidelines. And notice, the clicks are showing the features, but at no point am I describing the features on the page. And then the third and final step of a good demo is you need to ask questions to keep them engaged and to make sure that you're actually validating all of the problems you want to solve in discovery. My favorite way to do that is with a past question, Is if you ever watch the show Pimp My Ride with exhibit, he used to say things like, yo dawg, I remember you said you liked an air conditioning in your trunk. And so what we did is we put an air conditioner in your trunk. What do you think about that dawg? And there would be all this ridiculous stuff inside of this car. And so you kinda gotta be like, look, Jimmy, you mentioned that this was one of the most important things that you wanted to solve when you saw what we could do for you. I'm curious, how does this compare to what you were doing in the past? And so I'm comparing past state to future state. I can also use present questions. A present question is just getting more information around how they're doing things today so I can tailor the demo. So let's say, for example, they have a certain way their organization is laid out. I might say like, hey, like, typically what are the types of things that you would want your managers to see when they're making compensation decisions? That's a present state question. And then the last piece is when I start wanting them to see the vision of what it could look like in the future, that's when I'm gonna use a future question. And I might say something like, hey Jane, like let's pretend that you were rolling this thing out tomorrow. What would be like the first test group of managers that you feel like would be like a safe space to try this thing out with? And that gets them in the mindset of like, oh, I could actually see myself rolling this thing out today. So you use the demo deck to attach demo to discovery. You use stories to show them the day in the life before versus the day in the life after. And then use past, present, and future questions to get them engaged in the demo and validate that you're actually showing them the right stuff. Alright. So I've nailed my discovery. I've shown the best demo in the world. I got them engaged. Closed won. Right? You may have gotten rid of all of the ghosts, Nicholas, but you forgot about the monster in the closet. Number three, the Halloween ghost is not a ghost, but it's a deal with no powerful people to protect you from the monsters like me, and I'm going to eat your deal alive. Now let me tell you the importance of this one, folks. If you have a deal, even if you have a champion who's like, this is the biggest problem in the world for me, if it's not a problem for the business, in this economy, in this market, you are not going to get a deal closed. A single threaded deal is basically an unforecastable deal. Let's talk about how you get some powerful folks in your party to protect you from these ghouls that will bring your deal to an early death. The first thing that you need to do before you even get on with your prospect is you need to map your path to a deal in advance. What you need to know is you need to know who are the people that need to be involved in this buying decision and what are the meetings or steps that you need to have with those different people. If you don't know what those are, your company has probably closed deals before. Go back and look at past deals and figure out what are the different meetings and who was involved in those meetings. So in order to get your prospect now to go and involve those other people and have those other meetings, the way that you're gonna do that is you are going to teach them, here's where I think we need to go, using what is called next and next next steps. If you just in the last five minutes with a prospect say, cool. So I think next meeting, we probably need to get your COO involved. They're gonna be like, woah. That might seem like a lot. Instead, what I recommend you do is queue up the next meeting. Hey. So I think what we're gonna do from here is probably give you a deep dive demo of how this analytics dashboard is gonna work for you. And then you're gonna tell them if that meeting goes well, here's what our next next step might look like. So I would say, okay. Cool. So for our next step, I think we'll take you through a deeper dive of how our analytics dashboards would work for you. And I guess assuming that meeting goes well, what I might recommend from there is we probably need to pull Mike, your COO, in to get a sense of how this is gonna impact his resourcing. Does that sound right to you? Now what I've shown them is, hey, here's what's happening next in our journey. And if that goes well, where I think we need to go from there. That helps put us in the position of shepherding them through the buying process as opposed to putting all of the heavy thinking work on them. And then the last piece is if you want powerful people to join your party from their side, you need to get powerful people from your party to join. What I mean by that is when they start to multithread, you start to multithread. Or if you want them to multithread, you start bringing in people from your side. So if you want their CEO to get on a meeting with you, that person might not be willing to have a meeting with you as an account executive. But if you can say, hey, I'm gonna get our CEO on a call or our head of product on a call, Their executive will be more willing to get involved in the process. And so what I recommend you do is you look at your subject matter experts, your executives, your customer success or implementation team. Find ways to use those people to get your party size larger, which will help incentivize and encourage the other side to bring more people from their end. And you want your company selling to their company, not you as an individual selling to just one individual. And so if you follow those three, hopefully, you will be inoculated against the ghosts and demons and werewolves and ghouls trying to bring your deal to an early death. Oh, you might have power to protect you, but now the fourth beast is I'm going to cut you into a million pieces in this negotiation. It is the negotiation of death by a thousand cuts. So folks, let me explain why the negotiation death by a thousand cuts is probably the easiest way you can lose money in sales. In one call alone, if you do not know how to manage a negotiation, it is the difference between closing a $100,000 deal and a $60,000 deal purely because you do not know what to say in a thirty minute negotiation call with a CFO. Secondly, if you let a negotiation drag on, one of the most common reasons a deal can slip is also because the negotiation goes three, four, five calls instead of getting closed in one or two calls. So there are six steps that I like to follow in any negotiation. Three come before the negotiation and three come after the negotiation. So the first three are as follows. Number one, you need to know your pre negotiation leverage. The way I like to do this is identifying my BATNA or my best alternative to a negotiated agreement. In other words, if the prospect doesn't buy from me, what is their best alternative to buying me? So when I was selling compensation software at Pave, if a customer was, like, already running their compensation reviews on spreadsheets and it wasn't that bad, their best alternative is just doing that again. And I know I might have to lose more money on the deal in order to win the deal. Or if their best alternative is they literally lost their compensation person and there's no way they could get their compensation review done without a tool, and all of our competitors can't support their compensation philosophy. I know they basically have to go with me before their next compensation review. So not only do I have competitive leverage, I also have timeline leverage on the deal, so I'm probably not gonna discount at all. So that's step number one. You should kind of know the range that you might need to discount through. Step number two is you get into the call, you need to explain how price works, the implementation, the seats, all the services, and then you need to give the number a $100,000 and then shut up. Do not speak or explain price after you give price. If you do that, you come off as insecure about your price as if it needs to be justified. Number three is they're probably gonna buck at price, and that's actually when you kinda need to put it back on them Mhmm. And gaslight them. And so if Nick's like, holy smokes. I thought this was gonna be $50,000. I'm gonna say something like, Nick, I might have screwed something up here. I mean, honestly, like, normally at this point, we wouldn't be completely out of line. If we take a quick step back, independent of price, are we the vendor of choice in this case? Or is it even if we get to the right price, you might still go another direction? Because if that's the case, then honestly, like, you might need to go in the other direction. What I'm doing is I'm pushing them away and that will naturally allow them to push back into me. When they push back into me, now the negotiation begins. So the next three steps are as follows. First step, once I've engaged in the negotiation is I gotta lock down my deal. I've gotta lock down two things, timeline and power. So I'm gonna say like, Nick, I know we might not be exactly where you need to be, but there's probably some difference between where we are and what you had in mind that like we can find a reasonable agreement to land at. At. But before we do any of that, I only get one shot to get this thing right. Realistically, number one, is this something that you could get done by the end of the month knowing how long it takes to go through legal and all these other processes? And then number two, is this the final approval or is someone going to come and ask for another chunk afterwards? Because if that happens, I'm not gonna have a solution for us. So I wanna lock down both the timing and the signatures in the deal because the death by a million cuts happens, one, when the negotiation gets extended, and then two, when someone else comes in and they want a piece of meat too. Now let's just pretend that I'm working with the final decision maker. Now I need to get step five, which is the full and final ask. A million cuts happens when a smart negotiator realizes I'm gonna get 10% discount, 20% discount, 30% discount. Okay. I tapped out my discounts. Now I'm gonna get billing terms, extra seats, free months. Those are the millions of cuts that you need to get on the table now. And so ideally, what I can do is I can say like, Nick, you know what's inside of this proposal, and I need to deliver a full packet to my CFO that says, this is the billing term, this is the product, how many seats, this is the price. I need to know of everything else you see inside of this proposal. Are there other teams, you, your procurement, your finance, your legal team are gonna ask for me? Because I need to know those today. Because, god forbid, I go back, I get a price approved, and you ask me for more things. I'm gonna have to raise your price to pay for those other terms. And so at that point, now I'm forcing them to make trade offs between all the different things that they want, knowing that they only get one negotiation ask. And so now the way that I can finish a negotiation in one cut using my butter knife is I can take all of their asks, and I can force trade offs by presenting options. So oftentimes, if you want a kid to put on their shoes, you don't put on a stupid mask and a singlet like this. You say, hey, do you want your red shoes or your blue shoes? Shoes? You don't ask him, hey, do you wanna put your shoes on? And so if Nick is being a tough negotiator, I might say like, look, I can do a 15% discount, but you gotta pay it all upfront. Or I can give you 20%, but you gotta commit to a two year deal, and then I can extend your billing terms. So by giving him different options, I'm creating a cost to the negotiation such that he knows everything he asks for, I'm going to ask for something else in return. If he asks for a discount, I'm gonna ask for term. If he asks for billing terms, I'm gonna ask for more seats or a bigger commitment from him. And that is how you finish your negotiation, one cut. Oh, but you think you survived the negotiation, Nicholas? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I am the big bad IT wolf, and I'm going to eat your deal alive one security question at a time, and then you will meet the bigger badder wolf, the legal person who hates their job because they have not been fed any joy in their life for the last seven years. How are you going to escape the never ending pit of vendor review despair? He's right. Despite the really weird voice, you might get to a place where you have finished this negotiation on one cut with your butter knife, but then you move to vendor review where your champion, your buyer's like, great. Let's do this thing. I submitted the contract, but then legal takes forever. IT takes forever. They wanna go into a security review, and it goes on and on and on. And you end up missing the date you agreed on with your buyer, and your deal ends up slipping. And so you need to overcome this doing a couple different things. Thing number one is you need to work backwards with your buyer to map out where are we today, and when do you need to start seeing impact from this purchase? When do you need to be live And build a timeline, a mutual action plan, a joint execution plan of how you're gonna get there. And so the way that you do that before you even end up talking to the folks in legal, in procurement, in IT, is you need to align with your buyer on when do they need to be live. Okay. If you need to be live on January 1, when does that mean you need to start implementing this thing? Okay. Implementation takes two months. That means you probably need to start implementation in November. Alright. If you need to start implementation in November, what else do we need to do between now and November in order to get your contract signed, your kickoff call scheduled, implementation starting, and you work backwards to build a timeline from where you are today and all of the different things that need to happen for them to be live and start seeing impact. That's how you can hold them accountable on timelines so that they can put pressure on their procurement team, on their IT team, on their legal team because they know when they need to see impact. And pressure doesn't come well from you as a salesperson. Pressure comes great from the buyer saying, legal team, we need to turn this around or we're gonna miss our implementation date. So that's piece one is you get your buyer on your side by building a mutual action plan of the things that need to get done. Thing number two, as part of that mutual action plan, we've talked about legal review. We've talked about security review. We've talked about procurement conversations. Do not run those three things sequentially. Don't wait for legal to be done and then go talk to IT. Don't wait for IT to be done and then get on with procurement. You wanna run all of those processes in parallel. You know you're in a really good spot when you're doing red lines on your contract, procurement is talking with you, and you've got the security questionnaire getting filled out by your team. That is how you can go from a vendor review process of five weeks down to one or even two. We'll finish by zooming in on that legal process of the red lines. This is one of the places that deals get elongated like crazy because you might get your contract in front of their legal team, but their legal team has a queue of red lines that they have to do of all sorts of different agreements. And what often ends up happening is your agreement sits in a waiting line for, like, ten days, and they haven't even looked at it. And so they end up looking at it the night before it's supposed to be signed. They red line it like crazy, and your teams both just, like, don't have enough time to come to terms on things from a legal perspective. And so the way that you can accelerate legal review and make sure that that legal doesn't blow up your deal is you assign and you build with your buyer what is called a redline deadline, which is simply a mutual action plan that you agree upon with your buyer in terms of when their legal team is going to get you their first cut of red lines, when you are going to respond to their red lines, when they're going to give you your second cut of red lines, and then when you will have a call to resolve those second cuts of red lines. And so what I recommend you do is when you're talking through the legal process with your buyer, is you talk through those dates and you say, cool. So, like, obviously, we need to get this thing signed by the November. I'm looking at the collect calendar today. We've got about three weeks. Our team's pretty good at turning around red lines. And so I'm wondering if we can talk through what dates look like for expectations for your team to get us your first cuts. And you talk through this stuff with your buyer. And what I like to do is I pull up my screen. I share my screen, and I'll actually write in an email the dates that we are talking about live so that I can send it to them, and then they can forward that stuff to their legal team to hold them accountable. Oh, no. You have thwarted the beast, Nicholas. You have thwarted the discovery surface level disappearing below the surface. You have thwarted my hypnosis demo. You have power to protect your deal. You avoided the death by a million cuts. You even you somehow got out of the vendor pit of despair. You know, there's only one thing I can do. I will not consume you. I will consume you. You. The only way you can save yourself from me coming and gobbling you up right now is you must like, subscribe, and hit the bell. If you do not hit the bell, I will eat you and I will ring the bell and ask for seconds. Have a spooky Halloween, folks. October 31. I wish your quota a good night.
