## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigowski. And today, we have another podcast host. The host of the sales enablement podcast, a 180,000 followers on LinkedIn. Nick, why should people listen to the one and only Andy Paul? Armand, I thought you and I were pretty good at podcasting after, I don't know, 60 plus episodes of thirty minutes to Presidents Club, but Andy's put out something like a thousand podcast episodes. So we had a lot to learn from him today and so does the audience. Three, two, one, learn something today. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work in and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Andy. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Sure. The first one, two questions every seller must be able to answer. You have your manager comes here, looks at your pipeline, should be able to answer about every account, which is what value does the customer need from us in our next interaction in order to move closer to making a decision? And a result of the second question is as a result of receiving that value, what are the commitments that they take into next steps? Beautiful. What's number two? Number two is find the one thing, which is during discovery. You know, a lot of time wasted trying to learn lots of data, Some of that's important, but there's always one thing that's more important than every other thing. So you have to listen to understand what that most important thing is to the buyer and then find out who it is most important to. Love it. Round us out, Andy. What's number three? So true qualification is my experience has shown is you don't have a truly qualified account until the buyer has quantified the value they're gonna receive from their investment in your solution. So it quantified it in terms of dollars. So until they've done that internal business case, they're just window shopping. This one's always tricky because I've had a number of customers ask me, Arman, I I I love your product, but would you put together an ROI analysis for me? And every time I do it, I feel like I'm getting stuck in this commodity battle where I'm counting hours and putting BS numbers on it. So how do I get them to quantify what pain they have without me doing that? Well, it has to come from them. Right? I mean, if they're asking you to do it, that's still problematic. And so you have to have the connection with the people who are driving the biz internal business case because, believe me, they're gonna do an internal business case. Every company, well, they're not gonna rely on your ROI to make their decision on. That'd be an a factor. Right? But they're gonna want their own business case done. Until that's done, they're not committed to moving forward. You wonder why we have so many no decisions. Yes. That range from 50 to 80% of b two b deals in a pipeline end up in in no decision because they haven't done that business justification. They haven't made that commitment that, hey. We're actually gonna proceed because they don't know what it's gonna do for them. And so until they have gone through this process and you wanna help them, your ROI calculator can help, but it's not gonna be the decisive thing for them. They have to that commitment. It's happening. You just need to find out who's doing it. Well, so, Andy, you just said something that I'm really curious about is our customers are putting together their own internal business case, why we should do this thing. And so, of course, they're not relying on Arman's ROI deck that he put together that makes it look like, yeah, this thing pays for itself in two days. But one of my sales mentors told me, Nick, you've always gotta do the work for the customer. Meaning, make it as easy as possible for them to put together the stuff that they need. And so I guess I'm curious to hear from you knowing that the customer is not going to rely on Arman's ROI deck. How do I help them actually put together that business case? Because I don't want it to end in no decision, and they might not have ever done that before. Yeah. I mean, there's a couple parts to that. One is you can do the work like Arman talked about. You can do, hey. This is what we've seen in other customers. Right? This is some of the business cases they've put together. It's not just, you know, based on our ROI calculator. But part of it is you have to motivate them to get to the point where they want to do that internal business case. And so for me, I like to summarize this. Yeah. They need to be given that vision of success. Right? So if you're most important thing is, like, we wanna we want to increase market share 2%. What's that mean in terms of dollars? You have that information. If that's the most important thing, what's that gonna mean to you? If we can accomplish that, what's that mean in terms of dollars? And if they don't have that answer, then you need to keep working with them to help them get that because they're not ready to proceed until they have that. What's the impact gonna be on then you sort of layer. What's the impact gonna be on the organization? What's the impact gonna be on the team? What's the impact gonna be on you personally? So and walk me through that. Right? Don't just say, take the answers. Okay. Interesting. Well, tell me more about that. So let's walk me through the details of that. What would that look like for, you know, John who's a sales rep that's gonna use this new tool on a day to day basis? So let's let's get down to the details. And so you always wanna keep saying, what's the impact? What's, like, I mean in terms of dollars, time, something that they have to quantify so they really have to think about it. And so it just brush you off as sort of superficial answer, which they're sort of prone to do if you don't push them. So one thing I struggle with a lot is if I try to get people to quantify things, it can feel very cringier. It can feel like I'm leading them into a sales trap where I'm saying, like, well, what does this mean for your company? And then you and then this and that. And they're like, come on, sales guy. I know what you're doing. How do you finesse it a little bit? Make it more conversational. Right? It's just you just don't fall from one to the other. Right? It's a lot of us have to do with just well, tell me more about that. Right? Conversational. That's really interesting. And some people talk about just go, now tell me more about that. Right? It's just develop what works for you. For me, always extremely conversational and just sort of gradually keep layering on. So tell me more about that. What's interesting? What else can you tell me about that? And people feel like you're sincerely interested. And this is, you know, part of the presentation. Right? Is is if a seller comes across as being so pushy and persuasive, yeah, defenses go up, people are gonna say, yeah. I'm not gonna answer that. I'm not gonna give you the right answer. Right? Right? But if you've developed this connection that seems authentic, if you're building your credibility, if you're demonstrating to be trustworthy, right, because you haven't really helped start falling back into the the pushy MO, Yeah. People are gonna give you a time and answer your questions. I mean, that's that's I think it's the key to a lot of people miss is that it's just by being more human, being more open, more conversational, more connected with the buyer that they open up, and they wanna share things with you. I love that question. It's not even a question. It's sort of just like a statement where it's like, could you tell me more about that? I've been using that so much. Like, I don't know. I sort of I fall into this trap with this podcast where I have so many conversations about really, like, deep and detailed and smart discovery questions. And in reality, sometimes the best discovery I've ever had is when I've accidentally left myself on mute, and I'm, like, talking over the customer, and they just end up like, they can't hear me because I'm on mute, and they just start giving me more detail. It's amazing. I kinda wanna go back to, like, the beginning of the discovery call where you hop on the Zoom, and you're there smiling, and the customer joins, and you're, like, face to face. And a lot of times customers have this preconceived notion of, like, what an interaction with the salesperson is going to be. And the things that good sellers do is they quickly change the other person's perspective. And they're like, no. I am sincere, and I am somebody you can trust. And I'm sort of curious, like, what are you doing in the first couple minutes of the discovery call or initial call you have with somebody to, like, get them to a place where they are willing to share and, like, give you everything that you need? So I said, just connect. Be human. Be interested in them. I mean, I find it amazing, this day and age with LinkedIn readily available to everybody or the Internet readily available to everybody, that every seller isn't taking just a few minutes to find something out about this person that that can start a conversation. Yeah. There's this move a foot to sort of downgrade the importance of small talk, and it's wrong. It's just flat wrong. I mean, the multiple studies been done about it. Small talk is an important part of building a connection with someone. And so, yeah, I I thought we when, you know, we live in a day and age, let's say, with this pandemic. Here, everybody in that you're gonna talk to us, potential customer, has a shared experience with you. Why not spend a minute talking about it? You know, another one, which is is a brilliant way to to share the experience everybody has is I know it's gonna sound funny. It's weather. Everybody says, oh, don't ask the weather question. Well, yeah, of course, don't ask the weather question. But if somebody if you're talking to a customer on the East Coast in the midst of a snowstorm and they just had a snow day, and you grew up someplace where you had snow days. So are you maybe curious what your kids do on a snow day? That's something to talk about. It's just, you know, be interested in them and what's happening with them. And, you know, keep it focused on them. It's just it's the same thing you do as if you're making a friend. But as long as you've got one topic and it sort of runs to its natural conclusion, it's then, yeah, just segue to business. They know. Yeah. Start talking about your agenda for the meeting. If somebody's not there, ask, is everybody here? Let's get started. Maybe we could all turn off our phones. You know, there's just a little cue that says, okay. It's time for business. So what are you doing in your agenda, or how do you set up your agendas to prime yourself to be able to go to that? Well, it goes back to the thing about the value plan. I talked about the two things, two questions you should be able to ask because that really sets your agenda. Right? Because you're gonna have really other than the first call, you're gonna have sort of set that agenda at the end of your last interaction you had with them. And so you want to know, right, for every account in your pipeline, every qualified opportunity we'll stick about every qualified opportunity for now in your pipeline, is you should be able to know what they're expecting from you next. They'll help them move closer to making decision. And that that really is the denominator of value for most of the customers is progress. Right? In this time, we invested with you. Did we make progress toward making a decision? And if we didn't, what was the point of the interaction? Right? If there's a call, Zoom call, in person call, phone call, email even, you know, people have to take time to read your emails. And so you have to you have to know. You have to be conscious as a seller to say, do I know this this answer? If I don't, then maybe I wasn't asking the right questions or I wasn't going deep enough on my last interaction because, yeah, I'm just sort of shooting in the dark here. Well, what you're saying about progress is really interesting because I don't know. I feel like sometimes there's a lot of pressure on on sellers to be like, every interaction, I've gotta be selling hard and persuading and convincing. When in reality, like, if you're just progressing and the buyer is learning and understanding more and more and more about your solution, like, you're gonna keep getting closer, and then they'll start pulling more people in. Like, one of the ways that I was able to progress the deals my deals a ton, I was selling an ERP system, was getting the customer's IT director on a call with, like, my head of security IT and just having that sort of IT discussion that I didn't participate at all. I didn't know what I was talking about. I just set it up, but that helped progress the deal forward. And now they're having conversations internally. So you're right about progress. You mentioned something that I've been doing I probably started doing about a year and a half ago, and it's helped me a lot, but I don't think most salespeople do it. And it was teeing up the next steps at the end of the last call for the interaction you're in presently. Can you talk about that a little bit? Because I think it's really powerful. Yeah. You wanna confirm at the end of a meeting what's gonna happen next. Right? And so it's based on, did you have the right understanding from the meeting that you were just in about what's required, what they think they're gonna need, information, or maybe it's something that you've come up with, or maybe you think, god, there's some questions that need to be asked next time that we need to have this particular type of discussion. Because, you know, value can come in in multiple forms, but you should pretty well know that. And you wanna confirm that with the buyer when you're done. And that's the easiest way to do that. It's just to ask those questions. You can't be afraid to sort of put yourself out there and say, did I get that right? Or was this a value to you? Was this meeting of value to you? Did we accomplish what you thought we're gonna accomplish? Let's talk about what we're gonna do next time. But not a lot of mystery in it. It's just being open to ask those questions. Because a lot of times, sellers are sort of reluctant to say, ask. Well, was this a did we achieve what you wanted in this meeting? Because they're afraid someone's gonna say no. Just like but that they actually want that no. If you didn't do a good job, you wanna know. Or if you missed the mark somehow, and you could be perfectly well intentioned, you could have been perfectly well prepared. Sometimes meetings just don't go off the way you thought they were gonna do. Right? You get a new person in the room who hadn't been, on a call before and said they got their own agenda, which has happened to me a million times. Right? We thought kind of marching on this path. We've talked to everybody. There's one stakeholder. We haven't talked to you yet. Hope we can get him, and then suddenly he shows up in the room and he just craps all over everything. That happens. But confirm at the end of the meeting that you're on the right track at that point, and what's gonna happen next. I like that question because oftentimes buyers are gonna come with, like, a list of questions that they need to to get answered from you. And when you ask that question, they might actually, that might prompt them to look at their list and say, I didn't ask you about how you integrate with x, and I needed to. And we're at time, and it's like, that gives you an opportunity to set another next step. Well, we can definitely talk about that. Are you free next Thursday at free? Right? That's smart. Well, I mean, I think the the misconception that most sellers have is that the buyer understands what they wanna do. And it's it's a hard job to help them understand what the problem is they're trying to solve. They may have identified certain things, but it's our job to help them perfect their understanding of that. And it's our job to help them come to an understanding of how they wanna solve that problem. I mean, really, if if sellers are doing this correctly is they're sort of the third order question is, who do we wanna solve it with? Right? First, it's what are we trying to do? How do we wanna do it? The third order question is, who do we wanna do it with? Then, boy, we get a lot of credit if we help them feel like they have a better understanding of what it is they need to do. Okay? And I've won deals where a customer you know, for start ups selling mission critical communication systems, convenience, all the big guys. And the customer said, we gave it to you because you're the only one who we felt understood what we're trying to do. I love that distinction. It's you're right. Because the buyer comes in and they know they have a problem. Something in their business is not working, But they might not understand the entire extent of that problem, and they certainly don't understand the very best way to solve it. And if you can help them get more clarity around both of those things, because you've seen problems like this before, hopefully, And because you've solved problems like this before, hopefully, if you can just help them, like, understand where the heck they're sitting today, you have a ton of credibility. Now you don't have to sit here and say we've been in business since 1985. It's like, this person gets it. Like, I don't care if you were have been in business for two weeks. You helped me understand where I am sitting. Now, Andy, tell me how we get to where I need to go. That's your opportunity to pitch. Well, I think the other part to keep in mind is that customers don't wanna make the absolutely best decision. This is there's a guy who won a Nobel Prize, and Herbert Simon won Nobel Prize for his research into this decision making is that people start falling to one or two worlds. They're they're, like, called satisficers or maximizers. And satisficers are people who will gather information, do their research until they find a solution that satisfies their requirements and is sufficient to meet their long term needs. And then they they make a decision because they find it's not worth the additional investment of their time to keep looking because whatever incremental improvement they may find from some other solution is so small, it doesn't warrant the additional investment of time or lost market opportunity by not deploying the system that satisfies the requirements. To get as we just talked about, to help them understand and then help them understand how your solution best meets that requirement, they'll make a decision. Right? People talk about sales acceleration. It's really you go and think about decision acceleration. As you get the customer to the point where they understand this satisfies us, you're gonna win the deal more often than not. Herbert Stein found another group of customers called maximizers decision makers called maximizers. They will look at every single solution and guarantee themselves they've made the absolute best decision. But they're more rare. And if you can, try not to settle them. So how do I deal with these ones? Because these are some of the toughest ones. They're using you as column fodder, and they've got their list of seven demo requests. And I'm just, like, eating endless technical questions to get every single nook and cranny of the product covered feature for feature with another competitor. Do I just drop these deals, or is there a way for me to get out of these? It's easy to get exercised by customers that want you to compete across a broad range of features. Your job is to find the ones that are most important and focus on those. So I'll give you examples is satellite communications services first broadband high speed Internet to cruise ships. This is back a while ago. And so this is a cruise line in Asia. It's like the biggest cruise line in Asia. And they have, again, this huge compliance matrix, all these requirements. And I thought, gosh, we're a small company. We're a startup. We're being against all these major system integrators where we don't find something that we can do that's better than them. We're gonna be stuck. And so the sales guy had developed a good relationship with the owner of the cruise line. And so, yeah, we got on the phone and called the guy. And it turned out that he didn't care about high speed Internet browsing in this in, like, state rooms. They didn't care about voice over IP. All he cared about was make sure the satellite link from the casino on board never went down because he wanted to be able to access the real time take from the casinos at any time. So we boy, this doubled down. We'd made sure there was hot swaps on the links, and the link was never gonna go down. And we ignored most of the other parts of the RFP. We just focused on that and won the deal as a result of it because that was his most important thing. What happens is, speculate as you get to these later stage deals, you'll just get RFP after RFP after RFP, and I'll see these sales reps who look like professional RFP filler routers. And they're asking me for each question. They're like, I feel like our answer is gonna be bad here. Our answer is gonna be is gonna be bad here. And you start to ask them like, hey. Do you think they actually care about that? And, obviously, they don't know. And nine times out of 10, if you just reach out to the team that's submitting the RFP and say, like, hey. I had some questions about your questions so that I answered them correctly. They will almost always jump on a call, and then you're on a discovery call. And then you can know where to hit super hard in the RFP versus where you can say, like, hey. No. We don't have that, but that doesn't matter to you, and here's why. It doesn't matter to you or 10 other customers that we have as well. Andy, this has been phenomenal. I've got a a page and a half of notes here, so thank you for all that. But we've talked about a lot of really good things that salespeople can incorporate into their sales conversations. And now I wanna flip that on its head. So I wanna ask you about a bad habit. So my last question for you is, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it's hurting them more than it helps them. I think one that maybe people don't think about a lot is and it's in line with what we're talking about is don't accept what the customer tells you at face value. Right? Is you're talking to somebody that has an agenda. And this and this is not nefarious or manipulative. It's just you know, they have their own agenda. You need to understand what that agenda is, and it informs what they tell you. And so that's why you ask the follow-up questions. What tell me more about that. Well, what else can you tell me about that? And don't be afraid to push back because you wanna get to the place of understanding, and you only do that if you ask. And it's what I see is, oftentimes, with sellers is they look at, like, discovery or asking questions. Because I'm just I'm accumulating facts. Right? That's what discovery is. I'm gonna accumulate facts. That's not what you want. You wanna accumulate understanding. And this this understanding is a different level than the facts, and that's where you get through the follow-up questions and, you know, layered questions that take you deeper. Beautiful. Andy, thank you so much for coming on the show. Anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? Well, I happen to have a podcast of my own called Sales Enablement with Andy Paul podcast. People check it out. And, yeah. Well, we've got a new book coming out in February that excited about, and maybe we'll come back on later and talk about that with here. Beautiful. Put it on the preorder list, everybody. Go follow Andy. Check out his podcast. It's it's really, really good. And everybody stick around for a sixty second recap from me and Armand coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Andy Paul include, number one, always focus on the impact of an action to drive the prospect to build a business case. And the way you can do this is by asking layering questions. So what's the impact on the org, the team, and then the individual? Number two, for every deal in your pipeline, you should be able to answer what value does the customer need from us in our next interaction to move the deal closer to a decision? And then two, what is the result of receiving that value? Number three, at the end of a meeting, you should always ask, hey, did you get everything you expected out of this call? And are we on the right track? And then lastly, number four, when you get an RFP, give them a call. Don't just fill out the RFP. Give them a call and say, hey. I have some questions about your questions so I answer them the right way. And those are your four takeaways, folks. Nick, how can people help us out? I've been thinking a lot about the impact of inaction. And the inaction that I'm thinking about today is not subscribing to the thirty minutes to president's club podcast. If you don't subscribe to the show, you might miss a critical episode where we deliver best practices for sales that could help you win a deal. And with that deal, you could earn some commission and go buy some guac at Chipotle. So do not enact. Subscribe to the show and we'll see you next week on thirty minutes of Presidents Club.
