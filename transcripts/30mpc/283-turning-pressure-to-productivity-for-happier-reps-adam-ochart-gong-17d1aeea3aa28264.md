## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my cohost, Mark Cosgrove. And today, it's a grand slam of 30 MPC episodes because this is this individual's fourth time on the show. It is Adam Ochart, a sales leader at Gong. He's been a three time champ on the sales show and his first run on the leadership show. Mark, why should people listen? You know when you get on to a an episode and somebody's like, I haven't been doing this long. I don't know what I have to add, but they're bringing new, modern, innovative thinking to what they're doing. There it is. You wanna hear somebody that's fresh in leadership, semi fresh in leadership, doing new and cool stuff? This is your homeboy right here. It was freaking great. And I'll give you a hint. If you like popcorn, you might want to listen. In three, two, one. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busywork and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Adam. Welcome to round four on the show. And first time on the leadership show, we start every show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Cool. Thanks for having me. I'll start with number one, which is popcorn learning. And what this is in practice is getting several reps. I think the sweet spot's three. You can go up to four in a room together and do any sort of mock exercise. Could be a mock cold call. Could be mock discovery, a negotiation mock. And what you do is every two to three sentences, maybe every minute or so, you're gonna popcorn from one person being the person that's running the discovery call to the next person. And you have to pick up right where they left off, and we're gonna anchor one person to be the prospect. And what this forces is everyone, number one, has to be on the court. Right? And I'm not gonna call it or else I'll speak for myself. In today's modern day, and I blame TikToks. I blame Instagram reels. Our brains are short circuited. We wanna check Slack. We wanna check email. We're updating CRM. There's a million things going on. This forces everyone to be on the court. The second thing it does is oftentimes, I'll be thinking, wow. So and so is running a great discovery call. I'm really intrigued by this. And then boom, we'll go to someone else. And, wow, that's actually a better angle than I thought. So you get unique perspectives on how you can tackle a call. And the final thing is the discussion afterwards is gonna be really, really rich. Because people are really curious as to why someone took something a certain way. And also you can start to figure out, put the pieces together on the things that you might have done wrong or could have done differently. So popcorn learning is something I've actually implemented the last few months with my team, and it just feels much more productive than a standard coaching session. Popcorn, Adam. What's number two? Forced problem solving. Ironically, this is something that my manager was good at. I didn't love when I was a new rep, and I quickly learned that it was something that was very valuable for me. Anytime that I have the urge to give my team the answers, which candidly is quite frequently and not to go too much into my background, I grew up as a seller here at Gong. And I know most of the answers. Right? So it's the easiest, quickest thing is for me to give them the answers. But what I've learned to do is to get guardrail set up in which I am actually gonna force the team to be resourceful and find answers, think creatively, and be a problem solver before I can go in and validate those answers. And what I found is, number one, oftentimes, they have the answers. Right? You know, they're either uncertain or they didn't know where to look a 100%. The second thing is they don't come back to you for those same things. So it becomes much more scalable for yourself, and then they become more efficient. I typically ask questions, and I use a question that's been asked on me is, like, someone will say, hey. I need help with x, y, and z. I'll reply, I'm really excited to see how you solve this problem and what you present to me the next day. And the feedback is awesome. Amazing. Alright. What do we got for three? Cool. The last thing is just it's being a connector. And for those that aren't familiar, and I I you can probably link the article here. Gardner wrote a really good piece about the four types of managers, teachers, cheerleaders, connectors, and always on. Teachers are those that are really focused on teaching. Cheerleaders are those that are always gassing their team up. They're blowing you up in Slack all the time saying great job. The connectors are those that are actual conduit to other people within the organization to help you find the answers you need. And also outside of the organization, things like setting up reference calls, things along those lines. And then always on is the manager that's slacking you at 9PM asking you to update CRM when you told them to stay at night. With that said, the connector manager has a 26% lift in terms of productivity relative to the other types. The always on manager actually has a negative impact. Hyattrition, people don't wanna work for them. They're always stressed out. So I'm always pressing myself and asking myself, how can I connect my team with the people they need to answer their questions and to make them as resourceful as possible? Adam, I'm super interested in forcing problem solving. I found, like, okay managers kinda give answers. Good managers do something else. Great managers make people find their own answers. Right? And so the problem those reps want answers. They're coming to you. They want the shortest, quickest, easiest thing like you said earlier. Like, we've been all spoiled by TikTok and everything else. How are you helping them see the value of finding the answer themselves and putting in that effort? Like, how do you get this kind of culture of go find your own answers established? I think it's a great question. I think it starts with defining a culture as a team, and I could go probably talk a long time about this. But our culture is around Gong and with my team is around independence and surround development. And my my last name Ochart, our team name is the CEO Ochis. And I tell my team, you're the CEO of your book of business. Almost think of it as like a franchise. I'm like an advisor. So you should be able to hit your number and exceed your number without me here. And I I'm a support member, and I'll be as happy as I can to jump in and help whenever I need to. But the onus is on you to go make money. The onus is on you to close these deals. And we're aligned on that. So I think that's the first thing. So, like, anytime they push back, it's like, hey. I can give you the answer now, but the answer exists and you can go find it, and you need to start with being independent. And then from there, I'll work with you. But I think that's the first thing. And the second thing is it's similar to that around independence. What if I was out of office? What would you do? Would you not reply to this email? Right? You figure it out. So take a stab at it, then come to me, and then I'll invest calories and we'll work together on it. Is a typical workflow rep comes to Adam with problem, Adam says what, And then does the rep come back with an answer and then you walk them through why it's right or wrong and all that? Or is it Adam says something and then it's just go do it and then tell me how it works out? It's typically with new reps, they ask them for help. And I'll use an example. They will screenshot an email or forward me an email. How do I overcome this objection? Or what are your thoughts on this? My immediate response always is take a stab at replying and send me the draft. I wanna see how they're thinking. You'd be surprised. Some of my reps, especially those that come from other organizations that weren't promoted SDR Upward, they have better replies than I would have had in the first place. And think about how detrimental that is to me as a leader and to my team. If I don't give them a shot to be creative and show me that, right now I can, like, hey. Look at the way Jason handled this. This is incredible. Right? It's better than what we're doing in the past. And then the alternative is if it needs some tweaking, I typically find myself just one or two small edits and then going from there. So the flow is got it. Here you. Take a stab at it, and let's work together to clean it up. And then they deliver something, and you offer coaching based on what they've delivered. Right? Yeah. And, again, this is like an evolution cycle. Well, typically, it goes into a coaching session where I ask questions. Curious why you went with that? Because I wanna understand where they're coming from and understand the root of how they're thinking about problem solving. And that's evolution one. Evolution two is they typically send me something, and I just give it a thumbs up emoji. It's like, you're good. Fire it off. Step three is take a draft at it and let me know, and they usually stop me back. All good. Reply. And it's like the training wheels are off. Now you can go. This will happen super often when I'm doing advisory work with founders where they will ask me, hey. It seems like I'm having a hard time setting next steps. And they'll be like, how do I solve the problem? And when I first started doing advisory work, I would start to say, when you're ending your discovery call, you set out five minutes to set your next steps, and these are the three questions you ask. And they had already done half of that stuff. And so no one wants to hear advice that they've already chosen to take. Right? When you have your reps submit their own answer first, you give them the opportunity to get the green light with no answer. Right? And what you're doing from there is you're tweaking, and the most frustrating thing in the world is to just hear someone go on a three minute rant for the things that they've already done. So if anything, you get to save your breath on the advice that you're actually giving. And so, Adam, I wanna take this to another angle, which is we talked about the concept of help me respond to this email with a prospect. That's a very common monkey to be thrown on your back. My guess is this comes up pretty often during call coaching. Right? You get off a call with your reps. How do you approach that? Do you have them give an internal reflection first? Are you coming with a list of coaching points because they've already essentially ran the call and you know what to coach on. How do you do this in more of a discovery environment versus an email environment? Yeah. The call coaching part is more nuanced. Right? There's so many things going on. And to your point, often, the calls already happened. So first of all, the first thing I'll ask is, hey. Is this a trend in your calls, Or is this a one off thing where you got stuck? Because I wanna assess if this is a bigger trend, I'll then go to the team and say, hey, Armand had this happen on a call, and he didn't feel like he was equipped to answer the question. Is this happening to anyone else? And then we'll search across calls. Is it coming up frequently? And that's how I escalate towards, like, hey. We need to have an impromptu office hours around this specific thing. The second thing I do is, similarly, I'll just listen to their response, and I just wanna know why they responded that way. And, again, as much as I can get into the brain of my team and think about what they're thinking about, the better I can equip them with the answers that they need. Right? So it's a lot of discovery around, and it's like the coaching side of, like, why did you do that? And then it's what other paths could you have gone? What what are the thoughts that you have? Because oftentimes, they just don't think about an opportunity to take a conversation a certain place. And once you say that, it just clicks. And I talk a lot with my team about telling, teaching, and coaching, right, as the three different ways. If I tell them to go a certain path, we'll do it. But they might not remember it. If I can coach them to get there on their own, that's a synapse in their brain that is built forever. And then we'll drill it a couple times and walk through it, but they'll be in a lot better place. And again, now they're gonna be more independent, and it comes back to that the development and then becoming independent individuals. Where did you get this concept? When did it hit home? Like, tell me the story where, like, okay. This is how I lead now versus this is the flavor of the month. I heard it on thirty MPC and big whoop two days later. It's a mixture of the way that I was managed. And ironically, some of the things I didn't love at first, and then next thing you know, it's like, wait a minute. I'm mentoring people when I was clueless a month ago. And it was a little bit of that. And then it was me as an early leader, Honestly, getting stretched too thin and forcing myself to be an always on manager. I gave everyone the answers right away. I was, like, super rep. I'd been super successful and see everyone was pumped to have me as a manager. They're like, dude, this guy's great. He's been at t club a bunch of times. And I just gave everyone the answers, and what I found was I got stretched more and more thin. And it was so unproductive. So I had to meet my manager, and he explained the concepts of coaching, teaching, and telling. And the more you invest now and slow down and have uncomfortable conversations because people want the answers, You're gonna force them to think creatively, and you're gonna figure out who's independent. That was like a paradigm shift for me as a manager, and now it's the only way that I manage. I'm a manager, and we all know the manager's urge. I'm gonna get street cred. People will think I'm smart. I can't win deals, but I can tell people what to do to win deals. The urge is huge just to tell. How would you coach somebody to fight that urge? Well, I think there's a couple of things. I think salespeople and sales leaders are egotistical. So I would tell you first, it's a lot harder to coach. Right? It's infinitely harder because it requires patience and also requires tactics. Kevin Dorsey's episode that you had on here, he talks about the reason the best sellers make the best managers isn't because they know how to sell. It's because they know how to run discovery. Coaching is a discovery process within the problem that your rep is trying to solve. Right? That's what coaching is. So the first thing I'd say is, you wanna be really good at your job, you have to nail this. It's not negotiable. The second thing is you'll feel the pain if you don't. Sooner than later, you're gonna be absolutely blown up with a 100 Slack notifications. And you know what you actually feel is you take a day off. You take a day off and the wheels come off. And it's like you can back them as fires. And the final thing, I mean, I think it's really cool being the hero who, like, solve the problem. And I'm not saying that's not the answer sometimes. Sometimes you gotta move fast. The biggest flex as a manager in my eyes is you promote someone and that their new manager reaches out to you and says, woah, dude. Cameron's incredible. So independent. They know all the answers. They're such a good rep. That's awesome. Like, that's the biggest flex as a leader. Adam, with coaching, the consequence that could potentially come up is that you're having reps do things before you coach them. Right? You're giving them the chance to fail. And I think that having the chance to fail without the tricycle wheels on is oftentimes what makes people successful as you need to feel like there's skin in the game, that you're accountable to the results. Could you talk to me about where in your sales team are you putting some guardrails so that your team doesn't just fall on their face in a negotiation or something like that versus where are you okay letting the 20% slide with your team? It might get a little tactical to how we run things at Gong, but when people are onboarded, we have an unqualified queue. Right? So people that go through the router that don't hit our qualification criteria. And there's actually money to be made there. But that is, like, a very good place for people to go and cut their teeth. And I'm listening to a ton of those calls. Right? Because it's new hires. That's one area. The second thing is there's, like, an escalation doc that I have built out on when do you pull me in, when do we pull in my boss' boss, when do we create an internal Slack channel. Right? So there's guardrails around that. So it's very simple. As soon as we hit a certain threshold, let me ride shotgun. You're still the quarterback. So that's the second area. And, also, I have seasoned reps who are you can call them team leads. Right? They're just, like, seasoned AEs. There's moments to bring them in as well. So there's, like, levels to it. It's kind of a scale that they'd be sliding left or right on. Can you give, like, some examples of those guidelines? Like, when do you bring in you? When do you start a Slack channel? Those are interesting. Yeah. It's money. It's ARR. So there's thresholds there within the ARR, and it's pretty broken down with size of price relative to quota. So it hits a certain threshold. I I wanna be looped in. It's a bigger threshold. My boss wants to be looped in. It hits the largest threshold plus. We're gonna bring VP level. Can you talk about what that looks like during ramp? Because when I was ramping reps at the beginning, even the unqualified queue, I was like, at least bring another rep on all those calls. And then once you're in your actual territory, you bring your manager, etcetera. What does that look like for someone who's in the first three to six months of their job? Yeah. We move fast. You're gonna be on calls alone in the third or fourth week here. That's the nature of it. And, again, I utilize a pre call prep doc. So if my rep wants me to join a call, there's a doc that I share with them or that they have bookmarked, and they fill that out. And 95% of the time, we meet before that meeting. We talk and, hey. Here's what you need to uncover. You know how to sell. Go find those things. And guess what? We're not a trans super transactional sales motion. Right? So if you can't answer questions, that's fine. They'll check out your LinkedIn and see you're in your first month. We're gonna be okay. When you think about those and if you can give those numbers of what those guidelines are, knowing that they're gonna completely change per company, I think that would be helpful for the audience to wrap their heads around it. How many calls does that mean you end up personally being on as a manager when you think about the different places that you spend your time and how much bandwidth you have to jump on calls? Yeah. The amount in our world, let's just say it's thirty, sixty, a 100 k. So that's, like, 30 plus I wanna be involved, 60 plus my boss, 100 k we're gonna get the director on. I think that in terms of the volume of calls, it fluctuates a lot depending on how many people I'm ramping. We have data internally. We're, like, a very data driven company, and, obviously, our platform is analyzing calls. The best managers have a pretty simple routine. It is listen early, join late. So we're listening to a lot of discovery calls and coaching on that. We're joining those late calls. And it's funny. I asked my team when I joined a late call, like, it's a negotiation. It's a commercial discussion. Am I, like, putting the pieces back together here? Is this messy? Am I the full back? I'll join those later calls. The managers that have that makeup have the highest attainment, have the highest promo rates, the data backs itself. So when you ask how much I join, it's relative to how many ramping people do I have. Because I'll join some early calls with them. And then how many negotiation calls do we have? Because that's where we lean in heavily. What are some of the common roles that you play on early stage calls, mid stage calls, late stage calls? Early stage, it's a lot of pointing the reps in the right direction. Oftentimes, my team knows how to run discovery, for example, but they're not gonna focus on the right thing. So, like, they'll run disco on, like, a pain that's tactical and it's one thing, and they'll miss that, like, why are we even doing this? Well, it's because we're rolling out a new product, and we have all this going on. So oftentimes, I'll just take and I jump in. Cool. Hey. I wanna know about that. But before we do, you said this. Do you mind unpacking it a little, or why is that a priority? And then I'll Slack the rep, take this from here. And then they'll dive in. And I literally went through this today with one of my newer reps, and they were doing great discovery, but it was just in the wrong area. So that's early on. Mid funnel, I don't join a ton of mid funnel calls unless, you know, we were on pilots, unless people are on a pilot. And then late stage, it's often that full back position. I would bring this home. You know, I have four kids. I think I have four great kids. And I think one reason I think they're great is because I learned early on that preventing my kids from making mistakes hurt them. Teaching them to learn from their mistakes accelerated them. Are you having seen that same kind of thing with reps and salespeople? Like, do you let them make a mistake and then teach them? Or are you in pure mistake prevention mode and, like, getting ahead of it? Like, do is there space there for a leader to let reps make mistakes? Yeah. Again, I'll speak for my business, which is commercial. Right? So it's a little higher volume. It's not fortune 10, like, all eyes on those deals, a 100%. I don't mind my reps losing deals or having a quarter where their win rates go down if they're gonna seal that burn a little bit and come back that next quarter. And it's funny that happened to one of my top reps where it's like, I could have super repped their deals last quarter and closed the year out. And I'm like, no. He's so smart. He's gonna figure it out. Let's let him flounder a little bit, hold lick his wounds, and he'll come back with a vengeance. And that's exactly what's happening. So early on, I was white knuckling every deal and super involved. Now it's much more of a bird's eye view. Let them run their course. Let them self diagnose. And to your point, it all comes back to independence. I'm not doing anyone a favor. I'm probably just prolonging the inevitable if I run the deal cycles for them. What traits or characteristics or things do you see that would let you do that with a rep like that? Because that it's dangerous. You only got seven, eight reps, one or two miss, you're in trouble. Your wallet's getting thinner. Somebody's coming down on you. So what are you looking forward to let that kind of process happen? I think there's two things. I think, one, looking upward, I'm super open with my leadership about, hey. This deal's gonna push, and they're gonna learn from it, but they're gonna be fine. So I'm gonna raise their forecast next quarter, and this quarter's gonna be tough. And I'm lucky to have a great leader that she's like, cool. Got it. Let me know your game plan here, how you're gonna enable them, and so on. That's the first thing. I think the other trait that I look for is the best reps don't ask the same questions twice. A flag goes off when someone asks me the same question a quarter later. And it's so funny. I've got a terrible memory with a lot of things, but moments in deals, and I could tell you pretty much every deal and every little thing that's happened across those deals. So I remember these moments. I'll, like, go deep into Slack, and I'll forward them the thread. Like, we've talked about this in the past. How do we make sure that you don't forget this again? Is it bookmarked? Do you wanna drill it? Like, how can I help you? But the best reps don't ask for things twice, and they definitely don't ask a third time if they ever do twice. I think the key point there is really simple is if you have a culture and a leadership group, a leadership team that is willing to let people make mistakes for long term gains, you can do stuff like that. But when you're the type of leader that's pounding every single freaking deal, every single quarter has to be this. You know? And listen. I know we all have those pressures, and there's a board and all that, but I think that sales leader, that revenue leader's job is to be like an umbrella. Keep people out of the rain. That's your pressure. That's your pressure with the board. That ain't your rep's pressure. That ain't your manager's pressure. Your manager's pressure is to give this dude a space to make some mistakes so he comes back, like, hot for the next four quarters, and you don't gotta worry about him again. But we're so sometimes what we do is we close our umbrella as leaders and let it rain on all our people, and everybody's just getting wet then. Like, spread those arms, man. Be the protector. Don't pass pressure down. Prevent pressure from having people make stupid mistakes. I love that. And one of the best leaders I ever have taught me, she's like, it's your job to turn pressure into productivity. Woo. Right? Come on. Yeah. And it's funny because I felt both sides. I felt when the umbrella is closed, but I've also felt when I can tell my boss is really getting pushed, and he or she are holding it together, and they, like, let's do this. And I'll tell you on the flip side, there's moments where I've told my boss, hey. The dash doesn't look great. I think I've been here long enough that I've earned patience. So I just I need you to cover me for a month, and then we're gonna light it up. And those moments, number one, I don't wanna use those often. But the second thing is that's pressure. Right? To me, now it's like we gotta perform, and I gotta have a plan in place. So yeah. I love the way you phrase that. It it really comes down from the top. I want my team to focus on closing business and nothing else. Not the pressures I feel, and I don't wanna feel the pressures my boss feels. Yeah. Internal pressure is productive. External pressure is rarely productive, and you end up with boiler rooms, sweatshops, horrible culture stuff that just what ends up happening, Adam, is exactly what you said, is you end up with a bunch of super reps, super managers, super leaders that are closing almost everything, and everybody else is just kinda along for the ride to hold a quota spot. Everyone's burned out. No one's having fun. The one thing I wanna highlight with all of this, and it's anecdotes as a rep and it's direct feedback I get often from my team, when, like, things connect and they do something on their own, that is such a rewarding feeling, and you are on top of the world. And that more than closing a deal, like, you're on cloud nine. And if you're not getting that as a seller, you should go somewhere else. I create that as a manager still. Like, I wanna feel like I'm solving new problems. And as a rep, you can see when the ears start to turn, and it clicks, and that is such a good moment, and you need to lean into those. Adam, to tie up this topic of getting your reps to do the work initially, giving them space to fail, protecting them from those external pressures, I wanna go back to some of the things that you referenced all the way at the top of the interview around the way that you run team trainings, these group popcorn mock role play sessions. You have something where it's laptops closed. There was, like, a scribe involved. To tie this thing off, could you just walk us through how do you run that meeting? Because it sounds like you're doing the least of the talking in that meeting, which is a good thing. Yeah. I'm more or less an observer. We have a topic, and I don't surprise them with the topic. So they will know coming to Sydney at least the day before it's discovery or it's demo. And we're gonna demo, and here's what we know about the business. And we're gonna launch into a demo flow. Someone will pick someone random. They start as if they're demoing. Let's just say they're demoing me, and I'll role play as the prospect. And I'll say, cool, Armin. Got it. That's a cool feature. Hey, Mark. Why is that relevant to my business? And then Mark's gotta jump in and gotta go, like, add value and frame and and so on, and then pick up the demo flow from there. So it really comes down to getting everyone on the court, and it comes down to having everyone think creatively. And it is so hard to hold the attention of one person, let alone three or four. But this forces everyone to be thinking critically in that moment and a little bit on edge or on edge of their seat, they might get called at any time. One important thing, the team can call on me. So if I'm not playing the prospect, they can flip the script and call on me. I better jump in and better deliver a good demo or a good discovery question and so on. So one person is is playing prospect throughout the entire role play. Right? Yep. And then you're alternating the different sellers. One might be doing part one of the demo, part two of the demo, part three of the demo. How does this work for discovery? Because I imagine, usually, questions build on each other. Are you doing this for that part? And I'm curious if you have any guidance for managers who are trying to do this themselves to make this not totally go off the rails with your team. Yeah. The thing is every org should have a discovery framework. Right? It's a funnel. And in ours, it's pretty simple. It's like, what are we focused on? What's the number one priority? Why is that the priority? How are we solving that, right, which is, like, current state, future state, and then impact. And I'm, like, simplifying this a lot, but you you didn't get to impact. And that impact is org wide. Right? And then it's personal. You know, mister Ciro, if you can't fix your conversion rates, what happens to you in a year? It's like, well, I'm looking for a good job. I'm able to sell my Porsche. So that's the funnel that they wanna go down. And my team is very trained on that funnel, and I'm, like, taking notes as they're doing this. You should have a pretty clear understanding of what we need to go off of. And this is why I love the popcorn, because sometimes I'll feel like, I think that what was kinda weak, and we'll go to another rep, and they'll go back to run and think like, hey. Before I jump in, I have one more question about the thing you're solving. And, like, cool. We're on the same page of thinking about it. And then an important thing is we'll debrief after this, and it's a complete safe space. Right? No sugar is one of our operating principles. It's like, hey. Pour it on. Be as mean as you want. What are the things you didn't like that your peers did? What are the things you did? So good. Adam, another amazing interview. Unfortunately, we have to wrap. And so the final question is the same one as you've always answered three times now on the sell show, which is we've talked about a lot of good habits that leaders can exhibit, and now it's time to talk about one to break. And so what is one bad habit that all sales leaders can break so that every team out there gets a little bit better today? I talked about a little bit today. Stop multitasking. It kills me. There's so many things that are going on. If you are multitasking in a one on one, if you're multitasking even on a call with your rep and you're not looking at every mannerism the way they're looking at the camera, looking at who's coming on mute and off mute. Every little detail matters. You're wasting your time. You could be so much more productive if you were just paying attention, and this was a huge paradigm shift I had last year. Just be a 100% on the court. Also, how can I expect my team to be on the court if I'm replying to 10 Slacks and checking my emails on meetings and so on? I think COVID and remote work allowed us to kinda deviate from that, but being 100% on the court, it just changes the paradigm of of the way your team operates. Be a monotasking master, and I promise you, your team will notice it. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Cheers. Alrighty, Mark. It is time for our two by two recap. What do you got for your two? Two by two. Number one, the best reps never ask the same question twice. If you're trying to figure out if somebody's good or not, see if they keep asking the same question or not. I love that. That's one of those little tips you pick up along the way that pays off so many times throughout your career. And then the second one, number two, is turn pressure to productivity. Y'all heard me in the episode. I get that one a woo, boy. That was hot. I love that. Our job as leaders isn't to pass pressure on, is to use pressure to get more out of our reps and make them feel more free, more happy, more fun, make more money, and that's what pressure is supposed to do, not supposed to burn people out. Number three. I look forward to seeing how you answer this question. It's a little bit cheeky. Like, god. I'm gonna use that one because it is so tempting. Look. Everyone's got an ego. You wanna give them the answer. You want your reps to think you're smart, but the number one thing you can do is make sure that your reps know that they're the ones who are actually smart and they can operate independently. And then lastly, number four, I love the concept of listen early, join late. Oftentimes, if you do really, really good call prep with your reps, this will happen with Nick and I when we're game planning on a sponsorship call. We'll do a prep call together, and then we'll be like, hey. Do you really need me on this, or did you just need a gut check? And nine times out of 10, I don't actually need to jump on that call. Alrighty, folks. If you liked this one, our good friend, Adam Ochart, has been on the show multiple times. So if you wanna listen to any of his other sales show appearances, those will be linked in the show notes. And, otherwise, we will catch you on the next episode of the BBC. Peace.
