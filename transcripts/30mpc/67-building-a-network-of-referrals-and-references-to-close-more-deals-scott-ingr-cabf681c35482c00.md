## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Frogg. I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigalski, and we got another round two. It's a round two bonanza. We have the one and only Scott Ingram, the host of the Sales Success Stories podcast. Nick, why should people listen? I want you to imagine, Arman, the world where an individual talks to hundreds of top 1% performing sales reps and then distills all their learnings into their brain. Scott Ingram has done that. He's here to share quite a few learnings with all of us. Three, two, one. Hundreds of learnings. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright. Scott, welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Glad to be back, Nick. Let's do this. So the first one is ask for introductions. You know, there's so much emphasis right now just in the sales space in all things cold and building these 42 step cadences. And I think we've forgotten that one of the best ways to get into new opportunities and to set meetings is to get an introduction. So ask for those introductions. Beautiful. What's number two, Scott? The second one is when it comes to those introductions, you need to do the heavy lifting. So two things really easy on that idea. One is know who you want to be introduced to. Don't put all of that on them and have to think through their entire network. Come with an idea or two. Say, hey. I was looking at your network. What about Nick or Armon? Could you introduce me to them? Then when it comes to the introduction, do the work. You know, draft an intro for them. You guys had a great tip about record the Vidyard video for the person that you want to be introduced to and ask them to forward that to them. That's a great way to do it, but you have to do that work. Don't put it on them. Nice. What's number three, Scott? Round us out. So the third one is is maybe a little bit squishier, but I think we can make it real, is build your brand to support your credibility and value. So you're gonna be even easier to introduce if people know of your reputation. Right? If your reputation precedes you and they just saw that the amount of value that you were able to add in that conversation is real, it's even easier to introduce you. One of the easiest ways I think you can start to build that credibility is just take those little nuggets of insights that you have in one conversation. You might wanna anonymize that person. You might say, hey. I was just talking to another executive in your industry, and one of the things they told me that was fascinating to me was x y z. Right? Being able to relay those stories from their peers, and you can do that in a lot of forms. I do that through podcasts as as one of the ways that that I run that particular play. So, Scott, oftentimes, reps wanna know, hey. I know I want referrals, but I don't wanna ask at the wrong time. Should I be asking after a discovery call? Should I ask after the deal is after the deal is signed? Should I ask when they gave us an NPS of 10? How do I actually bake this into my sales process? Yeah. I think don't overthink it. Right? I I there is no perfect time. There's no no wrong time, really. Right? It's as you're as you're building each of those call plans, it should just be an item on your plan. Right? Hey. Here's an opportunity for me to make that ask. The most important thing that you do is that you ask. That is the most common thing that people miss. You're not gonna get those introductions if you don't ask for them. So don't worry about finding the perfect time, and is it the right conversation and the right point in the conversation? Just ask. Scott, I never in my entire career have been given a referral, and I've only asked, like, three or four times. And it's always been, like, I've sort of been sheepish about it, and I've been like, well do you know anyone else who's looking? And it just hasn't gone well for me and I think because I'm not doing some of the upfront work. So when you and I were on the prep call for this we were talking about like I have some awesome meetings with like these CFOs of law firms that I that I sell to and at the end of the meeting, you're like, man, Nick, you were so helpful. This was really great, and I'm looking forward to our next demo next week. I guess I'm thinking about it. I'm like, okay. There's probably a good opportunity because this person's like, they've got some gratitude. I feel like I helped them in this call. Can you talk me to me, like, what do I say in that moment, and how do I introduce it? Because I'm also in sales cycle with them, and I don't wanna damage that relationship by making them feel uncomfortable. What I would say would simply be, Nick, I I really appreciate you saying that. And as you can tell, I love this stuff. Right? Like, I I just get off on being able to help folks and and share this type of knowledge and this type of stuff and just being able to have these conversations. Are there people that you spend time with kind of in your peer network that are in kind of the same place that you think I might be able to help? And you can just leave it at that. Right? The more specific you're able to make that asked, the easier it is for them to go, oh, yeah. I know the perfect person. Let me make that intro right now. And I think that across the board, this needs to be the approach is, do you know or how good is your relationship with this person? So ask that first. Understand where that relationship is for them because it may be, you know what? We we met this one time at this one conference four years ago. I don't really know them. In those scenarios, it's not even fair to ask. Right? But they may it may be, oh my gosh. That was my college roommate. And and I think what you do then is dig into what is the context of that relationship. What do they know about them? Right? Get into kind of the human element, and then hopefully, you do have some nugget. There's some little insight that you can be you know what? I've been thinking about them a lot in the context of Pave, and I I think that I think that we could have a really productive five minute conversation about this particular topic. Are you comfortable making that introduction? Right? And and you really have to be soft about this because you don't want to make the person you're asking to make the introduction to feel uncomfortable or obligated or anything else. Right? Like, no is a perfectly okay answer, and you can't go into any of this with with, like, a hard expectation that you need to do this for me. That's not fair. So one of the things that when I was selling insurance was really tough for me is it was a 100% referral based business. And so if you did not get referrals, your business would die. And a lot of times we would talk about, hey. Would would you refer you to somebody else? And you get people who are, like, starting to wonder, like, am I referable? Like, am I a weirdo? Do people trust me to be in front of my customers, or do they, like, there's no way I'd let that Nick guy in front of my friends. And so how do I work on my my personal brand or whatever it might be, my sales process to make myself seem more likable, referable, what have you? Just asking that question of yourself is a great starting point. Right? Am I referable? And then I think the next place you go with that is go right back to that mentor network. Start asking people that you have enough relationship with that you've maybe you've done business with to say, hey. You know what? One of the things I'm working on is just getting more referrals and being more referable. And the question I'm asking myself and I'd love your perspective on is, do you think I'm referable? And why or why not? Right? And then working on those things. And and there's another perfect lead. And if they say, yeah. Absolutely. Like, you you served me so well. I love being your customer. Awesome. Ask for a referral. If not, if you can get some feedback, now you've got something to work on. And and let's let's round trip this again, then go back to them in a couple of weeks. Say, you know what? I I took your feedback, and here's what I'm working on. Here's what I've done. I would love to know if there's a point where you would feel comfortable referring. Right? You told me last time I had some work to do. I'm gonna continue to do that work. And and part of my goal is to meet your bar for referability so that I can come to you and make an ask for an introduction. Scott, you know what you're talking about. I mean, you've been in the space that you're you're in right now for a really, really long time. And I found that you kinda need to strike a balance in a meeting like that where you wanna demonstrate credibility, but you don't wanna just like talk at that person and be like, well, I've been in this space for twenty years and I know everything about everything here. Because they're like, well, that's not why I came here. I came here to solve a problem. And so I'm wondering if you can talk about, like, when you're in a meeting, tactically, how do you how do you balance demonstrating credibility while also understanding their pain and problem that you can hopefully solve and then, I don't know, close a deal? So for me, a lot of times what that is is let me lead with an insight. Right? I was just talking to this person who looks and sounds a lot like you. They were struggling with x. One of the things they shared was y. What does that look like for you guys? Are are you struggling with that same issue? And then we can have a whole conversation, and the rest of that should be just me asking questions. And if I the the real way that you're demonstrating that expertise is asking questions about things that they haven't even thought about yet. Right? I I heard I was at the outbound conference here recently, and and one of the things they were talking about was and I I wish I could remember who said it. It was probably Anthony Iannarino who who was saying that when somebody says, that's a good question, that usually means that you got them to think about something they hadn't thought about before. That means you're on the right track. Like, the more that you can get that type of a response and then again, super, super important, stay quiet. Let them sit in that. Don't jump up and down. You're like, yeah. That was a great question. No. Let them sit with that question for a little bit and formulate an answer because there's nothing more valuable than watching and hearing somebody's thought process in real time. Like, really like, I didn't have that answer right in my back pocket. I'm gonna have to think through that. I'm gonna have to talk through that. Now you're on to something. One thing that I don't know if we've ever talked about is the right way to manage references. In other ways, the other way around. So having your prospects get referred to people that you know, or customers that you already have to help you cinch up the deal. So are there any best practices you have around managing the relationship the other way around? Yeah. For for sure. So this is one of the benefits of being in sort of the same space in the same company over a period of time because, ideally, you wanna be in a position that you can sort of manage all of your own references. You're not having to go to the market marketing team or other parts of the organization to do this because then your reference is good for two things. One, you know references can be dangerous. Right? If you haven't vetted that, then you might be setting things up to I actually just killed my deal because I set somebody up with a bad reference, and they're like, actually, you probably shouldn't do business with these folks. Right? So one is if I can find a reference that I have a relationship with, not only will they be able to speak to my solution, but they're gonna be able to speak to me. And they're gonna say, look. Scott is not gonna go away after the end of the deal. He's gonna take care of you. He's always done right by us and and served us and those types of things. But that's where it starts. Right? Whether it's your own or somebody else, you have to have some type of real quick prep call to understand, like, hey. Here's the things that are likely gonna be important to them. Here's the things that they're likely gonna ask about and they're gonna care about. How do you feel about that? Again, just kind of qualifying that reference. And I will never blind connect a reference. Right? Even if I know this is my happiest customer, they would do anything for me, doesn't matter, out of respect for them. And and this is what I'm managing this on both sides. You ask for that reference. And I say, look. When you're a happy customer, I'm always gonna ask you first before I I connect you with somebody that's that's asking for a reference. So let me do that with them. Let me get their permission, and then I'm gonna set you guys up. So that that tends to be kind of my process that that mitigates some risk, make sure you keep you're respecting the relationship and their time because maybe, you know, it's they're they're an accounting firm, and you're in the middle of tax season. Yeah. That's kind of the wrong time to be asking them and burdening them with with a reference call. You're gonna need to find somebody else. Scott, how do you handle unreasonable reference asks such as, I want a list of all of your customers, or it's the very first call you've had with somebody and they're like, well, I'm gonna need to speak with some references and you have a an eight month sales process. How do you handle one of those asks? Yeah. So I'm I'm always I'm always gonna let them know, hey. We're happy to help you with with the references stuff. But, typically, for us, that's much later in our process. Like, let's make sure what ultimately, what I wanna try and get is I want you to tell me that I'm your vendor of choice, and we're just gonna work through the details from there. Because to me, a reference is part of a due diligence process. It's not it's not a front end thing. It's a back end thing. So let's get there first. Let's make sure that we're the right solution before I make a big ask of my customers to spend time with you. Right? Again, I'm gonna set this up the same thing just like I would wanna respect your time and not have you talk to a bunch of random prospects on the front end of a sales process that that's just not a good use of anyone's time. How do you brief your your references? Because some sometimes I'll see reps just go like, hey. Meet this guy. And the guy is like, okay. And they jump on the call, and the next thing you know, they're peppering them with seven security questions or questions about granular permissions. And the reference is like, oh, someone else on my team was managing that. So how do you how do you prime them so that the conversation goes well? Yeah. Actually, I was I before we came on, I was listening to our first episode so folks can go back and and listen to episode 11. And and we talked about some of the I I don't think it's very different from the way that you brief your own executives and others on your team when you're bringing them into your deal. Right? So it's really just you wanna provide a little bit of context. Right? Here's the company. Here's what they're trying to achieve. Here's what I think they're gonna be most interested in and what they're gonna wanna ask about, and and then just setting it up that way. And you can do that on the other side too. And for the person that wants to have the reference call, ask them, hey. What are the things that you're gonna wanna make sure that you ask about so that I can help prepare them and and make sure that this is the right person? Because, Arman, you you bring up a great point. There's lots of people in that particular company that I could connect them with. So typically, I I think the easiest way to manage that is just make it a peer to peer type of thing. Right? So if it's it's an executive doing the reference call, well, I should be connecting them with another executive. If it's a technical user, let's connect them with somebody else technical. Scott, one of the things that I've been reading and seeing a lot on link especially LinkedIn recently is people who are like, you gotta build your brand. It's so important you build your brand. And I see a lot of salespeople, like, making some sort of weird posts on LinkedIn and an effort to build their brand. And I feel like you're somebody who's done it really well, and it's something that you put in the prep doc was the idea of, like, putting together masterminds and developing a brand and a network, and it's resulted in you with one, some really cool business ventures that I I wanna talk with you about. But then two, you've built sort of this referral network, and you're a trusted person in your space. And so I guess I'm wondering, what advice do you have for people who, like, need to go and build a brand, and they might be in sort of a weird space? Like, it's easier for you and me maybe because we're selling to sales and marketing, and that stuff is sort of natural to talk about on LinkedIn. But what if you sell the legal tech? Well, a couple things. One, what do you want to be known for? Right? So within that industry, what's gonna be valuable to the people that you're selling to, and where are they? Right? If they're not in sales and marketing, they're in legal tech. Are they on LinkedIn? Maybe not. So where are they? And that's where you need to be. It's sort of pointless to be trying to build this brand and this reputation where the people who you want to expose that to aren't. So you've gotta solve for those two things. A personal brand, the way I see it, isn't necessarily just what you're saying about yourself and what you're posting and all of these things. It's your reputation. It's what other people say about you and how they feel about you. So your brand happens inside of your organization. What are you known for inside of your company? Right? What are you known for with your customers? How have you set yourself up? How have you built that credibility? That's probably the most important, most direct thing because I know, Nick, if if we've been in three meetings together as part of the sales process, and I've got a really good feel for you, and I understand your style and the value that you bring, and you post this other, like, really random stuff on LinkedIn, your brand is the one that I'm most directly connected to, not this, like, silly stuff that you're posting that may or may not be relevant to me. Scott, I wanna ask you one more question that's sort of complete if not sort of, it's totally unrelated to what we've been talking about. It's something you've said earlier. You were talking about this Fortune five hundred account that you were working and you were having a conversation with one person and there was another division that it sounded like used a comparable or competitor product, and you sort of wanted to break into that other division. And I don't think Arman and I have ever really sold that big at, like, the enterprise level. And so I'm really curious to learn from you about, like, how the heck do you keep track of an account like that where you've got multiple roles and divisions and opportunities to sell multiple times within the same account? Yeah. So, well, typically, what's happening in that scenario, and and probably the reason you're struggling to wrap your head around it, is when you're working in that scale of accounts, you don't have dozens or hundreds of them. Right? You you've got a pretty small set that you that you're working. Right? So I probably have, I don't know, 15 active Fortune five hundred accounts. So it's a little bit easier to manage from that perspective. And then you're doing a lot of kinda stakeholder mapping type of work. I spend a lot of time in my accounts just, again, getting curious and understanding what is the organization structure. Right? What what are the different divisions? What are the different geographies? What is the the support model? Right? Are are they really siloed? Are they more centralized? What you know, how do they make decisions? Is it really procurement led? Is it more driven by the the business? All of these types of of things. And then, you know, just just the over time, understanding what are the network dynamics because that might be a little bit different than the the way the divisions are are set up and the way that the org chart works in terms of, you know, who has influence and and who can kinda steer things and who's really well connected. Right? Sometimes I find some great champions where they're not in very senior positions, but they're they've just got the whole company wired, and they can walk me into all kinds of crazy doors. And they have their own personal brand inside that organization where they're known for bringing value to other people. So that's a great person to to have that relationship with because because it it's a it's a two way street. Right? I'm gonna be able to add value to them because they can use me to add value to other parts of of the organization. Because, again, we've built that level of of trust that, like, I'm gonna make you look good. Like, this this introduction is does not carry relational risk. I'm not gonna hurt you and make you look back because you're like, oh my god. Really? You introduced me to that guy? Like, don't bring any more used car sales guys in here. That's not okay. So, Scott, with a book that you only got, I don't know, 15 accounts. And one of the things people struggle with is they blast an account with their 42 step cadence or sequence or whatever it is. And they're like, alright. I'll let that one rest for sixty days and then come back. With 15 accounts, you you can't you have to be able to gracefully walk back in. And if you get the first no, you need to be able to, like, sort of wedge your way in somewhere. You're working one account over months. And so even if you get a no from one person, how do you gracefully break into accounts? Because if you get 15 no's, then you literally don't have a territory anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Well and and I think, one, you don't wanna put yourself in a position that it is it is hard no's. So part of this is just the context around, I work for a professional services company. So it's not like I have this one product that does this one thing, and if that doesn't help you, I'm done. Right? A lot of this is just having really collaborative conversations. Right? Asking a lot of those questions, understanding what those issues are, and then I get to do the work behind the scenes. And, hopefully, I'm bringing them ideas, or I'm introducing them to a different consultant who has a similar experience on my team that worked on a on another project in another company, and they can share some perspective. So I've got a lot of different angles that I can use. And remember, when you're thinking really broadly about these accounts, some of sometimes there are hundreds of people I can potentially be talking to. So it's it's pretty hard to run out of folks and feel like, okay. I'm done. Like, I've talked to everybody. It's also for me, it's a more patient, approach. Right? This this isn't let me just blast them and and try and get through this. And anybody who will talk to me, we're gonna have this conversation. It's way more thoughtful than than that, and it ties back into the into the brand. Right? Is Scott known as somebody who's gonna bring value to a conversation? Right? Even if I've met with Scott before, it was three months ago, there wasn't an opportunity. Did I get enough value from that conversation that I'm like, oh, Scott, you've got another idea. I'm willing to take that meeting. That is really, really key, and and I I get this from a lot of enterprise sales folks, especially when they work for super name brand companies. Right? If you work for Microsoft, you work for LinkedIn, you work for Google, getting the first meeting is the easiest thing ever because you work for Google. Getting the second meeting, that's where the rubber meets the road. Right? Because that means that you brought enough value in the first meeting, that there was something relevant there, and they're willing to meet with you again. That's the game. Well, so you've just said something there where you're reaching out to these people a second time with, like, an idea. And that's different than sort of the prospecting that I I do where I'm like, hey. I think you have a problem. I think I can solve this problem. You wanna learn about how we can help you. Can you talk about that, like, idea formulation and how you're using that as a prospecting, opportunity? Yeah. So, I mean, idea, insight, question. Right? It's it's any of those things where, again, oftentimes, I'm coming in with some type of assumption. Like, I've heard this about what you're dealing with, or, again, we've solved this challenge for three other divisions in your business. I wonder if you're struggling with that. Is that an issue for you? And, again, then we're into the conversation, and I can start to talk about, you know, we've had success in tackling this one of two different ways. Right? And it kinda depends on on your culture and the makeup of your team. Like, which of these do you think might work best? It's all of that so much of of what I do, it's it's it's almost more consulting than in in sales. Right? It's I'm just trying to bring ideas, to have smart conversations, to bring some good relevant value, And this is just a ton of fun. Like, all I do is have amazing exciting conversations all day, and that makes it even easier to get that introduction and to go on to the next one. It's like, it's too bad it didn't work out here. Right? There wasn't an opportunity for us to fix this. Do you think this other division over here that I haven't talked to you at, do you think they might be able to to be served by by what I'm talking about? Oh, sure. Awesome. Can you introduce me? This has been phenomenal. We're running out of time. We gotta move to the final question. Final question is this. So we talked about a ton of great things salespeople can be doing in their lives to do better, but now we gotta flip that on its head and talk about a bad habit. So my last question for you is what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that they should probably stop doing because it hurts them more than it helps? I think that bad habit is just taking any one of these ideas and not making it your own or or taking something that works for somebody else and and just trying to trying to do that when it may just not fit your style, your approach, your industry, any of those types of things. We've gotta be a little bit more thoughtful about, okay. Here's, Scott shared an interesting idea. I wanna try this introduction play, but I really need to think about, okay. For me, in my process, in my approach, how is that gonna work best? How can I how can I try that in a in a way that that fits me and isn't the way Scott does it? Because you're not Scott. I love it. Scott, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? You know, I've got a a brand new thing depending on the on the timing of this. It may not be that wildly new, but a lot of people are familiar with my LinkedIn sales stars, process that I've been running for a while, and we've built a tool to automate that. So if you go to successalyzer.com, you can put in your email address and your LinkedIn profile, and it will give you your engagement score and tell you how you rank. It's a pretty cool little tool. Oh my gosh. I'm gonna have to do that. I'm gonna be checking every single morning now. Scott, this is awesome. And and folks, if you're listening to this, Scott was talking about thanking mentors for the work that that they've done and and what they've given back to you. If you enjoyed Scott's interview here, please message him on LinkedIn and tell him you heard him on the show because he's helped me and Armand a lot as we've developed this show and our, I don't know, sales careers. So, Scott, thanks a lot for coming on the show, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Scott Ingram include, number one, do not just ask for referrals openly. You can make suggestions of, hey. Do you know this guy Nick? Number two, when you're getting a referral or when someone's gonna send some information to a referral, use a video. You can personalize the message. And if that gets passed around, you're much more likely to actually get the referral. Number three, when you're getting a reference for a customer, don't just say, hey. Go talk to this potential prospect. Prep your reference so they know exactly what the talking points are and exactly what objections your prospect will have. And then lastly, number four, demonstrate credibility. Do not only ask questions. You need to display some insight. In other words, these are some things that I've seen happen with other customers or things I've seen in the space. I'm curious to see if those resonate with you at all. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Alright. We talked about referrals. Look. If you like the show, share it with the salesperson who might get something out of it. That's a great referral. Thanks for listening. We'll see you guys next week on thirty minutes to President's Club.
