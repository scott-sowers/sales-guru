## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Farouk. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Skalski. And today, we have the one and only, the author of The Transparency Sale and founder over at SalesMelon. He's the one and only, Todd Capone. Nick, why should people listen? Wanna talk about removing friction from your sales cycle and making the customer's whole process to buy easier and, by the way, your process to sell easier? Listen to this episode. Three, two, one. Transparency sale. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Todd. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Number one is focus on helping the buyer predict. That's what we're wired to do. As it turns out, we'll get nerdy on this later, but transparency sells better than perfection. We, as human beings, were wired to try to predict what our experience is gonna be like. That's why negative reviews work on a website. It helps the buyer build trust right from the get go, engage, prioritize, decide faster. So at its core, focus on helping the buyer predict. That's your job. Beautiful. What's number two, Todd? Number two is if you wanna reduce losses to the status quo, remove friction from the buying journey. And I could go on like, I've been researching the crap out of this one, lately. But as it turns out, our perception of reward is biased by the journey to get there. Alright? A crazy example for you is, let's say you want some tacos. You run out. You're like, I'm gonna go to my favorite taco place. You run out. You see the line that's down the street. You're just like, tacos aren't that good. Right? You were in the market. You were excited about getting these tacos, but the journey to get there was unexpectedly difficult, so you chose the status quo. We do that. We force that in our selling efforts all the time by creating difficult journeys to get to the reward, and it drives customers to the status quo. So number two, again, is remove friction from the journey wherever possible to keep that reward looking as sweet as the ice cream you just got in line for. Wonderful. What's number three, Todd? Round us out. Again, number three is practice clinical empathy. And what I mean by that is, you know, empathy is such an overused word. It's just like, hey, guys. I hope you're doing good through these trying times. Like, that's BS empathy. True clinical empathy is being able to experience what it's like to be in your prospect's shoes, right, and understand what's going on in their day. And, you know, one example that I know we're gonna dig into is as a CRO in my last role, I was getting a 100 to a 150 emails a day. I was in 30 to 35 meetings per week. To get through a 100 to a 150 emails, I could get through them pretty fast. But just imagine video. We're all of a sudden using video to prospect. Just imagine I've got twenty three minute videos in those a 100 to a 150. Do you think I'm gonna spend an hour going through them? We need to understand and get into the shoes of the executives and figure out where the best place is to use those and not ruin them by making them generic because it's not gonna be long now that your executives are gonna stop reading or watching videos altogether. There's still time to save it. So let's talk about this number two, the removing friction from the journey. So I'm so sick of the crap where it's I have to do my disco before I see the demo. I have to be at power before I discuss price. I gotta get the value before I give them a proposal. I gotta do this before I gotta do that. But then some of that stuff, you know, you gotta do a little bit of it, I'm sure. So what's some of the junk that we put in front of our customers that we need to immediately throw in the trash that is conventional sales wisdom? Yeah. I mean, I it almost is a combination of looking at number three and empathizing with the person that's come to you interested. Right? I mean, imagine I fill out a lead form on your site, and I'm like, I am interested. And wait. Somebody gets back to me, and it's a SDR that's like, I'm gonna put you on the witness stand, and I'm gonna ask you 50 questions right. I'm just gonna pebble you. And you're you were here. You were this excited. And at this point, now you're down to here. They pummel you with these questions. At the end, alright. You're gonna share something with me? Can I see a demo or see what this you've just earned the right, congratulations, to talk to an AE? Like, oh, alright. Cool. When does that happen? That'll be next week on Wednesday. Okay. Cool. Next week on Wednesday happens, and that person puts me back on the witness stand, starts asking me a lot of the same questions, asks me some more that I know are gonna be used against me in a court of law later. And then they're like, can I see it? Can I get the demo? Oh, we're gonna have that solution consultant get on, and then they'll do the demo. Alright. When's that? That'll be next Monday. Oh, alright. Cool. Now I've completely forgotten why I filled out the lead form in the first place. Monday comes. I see this demo, and it's completely generic and used nothing that was learned from the first ten days in this whole process since I've. And now I'm like, oh, you know what? I'm just gonna keep doing what I'm doing. And then the rep is just like, gosh. How did we lose to the status quo? I I can't believe they just wasted our time. Like, wasted our time? It's not them. It's you. Right? And that's those are examples where we're not empathizing with the process. Right? That when I fill out a form, I have something that I'm interested in it, and I'm trying to get to a prediction. Now if we combine it with number one and this idea of why do reviews work on a website. Right? 96% of us look at reviews before we buy something online, but the amazing thing is 85% of us go to the negative reviews first. You skip the fives and go right to the fours, threes, because we're trying to predict. Right? That's when a website's acting as a salesperson. When a human being is acting as a salesperson, we've got to empathize with the fact that their brain is trying to predict what their experience is gonna be like using your products and services. The more that we can inject in and capitalize on that excitement that they had when they filled out the lead form before we lose them because we've got certain steps, Armand, to what you said about, like, we've got processes, and they gotta earn the right. Well, you're gonna be earning the right to much more status quo decisions, and you're gonna earn the right to have to do a lot more prospecting to make up for the crap that you just caused. I wanna go back to the thing that you were talking about about the three star Amazon reviews or the two star Amazon reviews that people are looking at. And I I always have this insecurity where I don't wanna pull out all of the things that I suck at, But I know you have a different perspective on this. So I I was could you talk about that a little bit? Like, how do we do our own three star Amazon reviews without totally shooting ourselves in the foot? Well, first of all, the the term that I want everybody to know is, comes from a supermodel. So, like, how would we not inject the wisdom of a supermodel into sales? But Tyra Banks coined the term flossum. And flossum means to embrace your flaws, but know that you're still awesome. Right? That data around how we all look at reviews, and 85% of us go to the negative reviews first. The core element there is that a product on a website that has a review score average between a four two and a four five, that's optimal for purchase conversion. In other words, a four two sells better than a five. And what I mean by that is I'm not advising anybody go into your next sales cycle and go, hey. This is why we suck. Right? Like, no. Think Flossm. Think four two to four five. Again, every company, every solution in the world, every retailer, every person as an individual, they give up something to be great at their core. Right? And that something is probably easy for that customer or that prospect to find anyway. This whole element of leading with your flaws and leading with transparency, it sells better. The behavioral science, the data, the research, all that, and the practical application tells us that it sells better than perfection. When we start to position our products and services that way, you'll find that customers engage faster, you win faster, your sales cycles go down. I've got tons of examples of sales cycles going down so dramatically, blow your mind. Win rates go up. We qualify deals in faster that we should win. And then the deals we're gonna lose anyway, we lose those faster too. So we spend our time in a better way with the opportunities that we should be win. Should I be giving price before I have established value, before I'm at power, before I'm on meeting three, seven, or eight? Or should I just throw it out there and get this thing out of the way so they move? If I'm talking about a 7 figure solution with a 5 figure buyer, one of us is in the wrong discussion. Right? That was always my feeling is you gotta set the range. You gotta get somebody in the framework of, you know again, when we when I talk about we're wired to try to predict what our experience is gonna be like. We're wired to try to figure out whether the juice is gonna be worth the squeeze. Now the way our brains are wired is if all you do is talk about how great that juice is gonna taste, but I have no idea what the squeeze is going to entail, my brain won't file it. It's going through a filter of going, yeah, but yeah. Or what's the downside? There was a recent research. I I read research. Like, I don't read books anymore. I read literally behavioral and decision science research. That's my nerdy. Oh, and sales history, if you ever wanna go down that path. But this was a study in the Journal of Marketing Research in October. The title is open negotiation, the back end benefits of salespeople's transparency in the front end. And this talks to the fact that when we actually lead with that price range, that, hey, Arman, before we get too deep into this, an investment like we're talking about, customers like you that have some of the challenges you do, we're probably gonna be in this in this range. Right? Now if that's gonna be trouble, like, let's address that now. Let's get that out of the way. Let's figure out the path. Because if we're way off, again, one of us is probably in the wrong discussion. What that does, now that the research backs it up, that it builds your relationship on a foundation of trust. And in the end, you end up again, your sales cycle shrink. You end up with customers that not only buy, but they stay longer, and they're more willing to advocate when you lead with your price. And I know there's gonna be people listening going, oh, but alright. Cool. Yeah. There are certainly circumstances where maybe you don't want to, but all of the the research and all of the data, all the behavioral science tells us that it disarms the buying brain and helps set an expectation so that they can assess whether that tasty juice is gonna be worth the squeeze to get it. Todd, can you talk a little bit about weaving in the flossum to the conversation that you're having with the buyer? And I'm hoping maybe you can give me an example. So let's say you're in a meeting with somebody and, you know, you've learned a little about them, they kinda learn a little about you, and they say, well, can you tell me about your business? I think what a lot of salespeople have been taught is to start talking about the logos and why they're great. And I'm curious, like, how would you approach that question? What would you actually say? I'll give you a story. So there's nine of us in a hot Manhattan office at this big apparel manufacturer. This dude starts the conversation in the most New York way possible. Like, there's no small talk. It was just, Todd, looking at your competitors, looking at you, how are you better? And like the other seven people, their arms are going up. They're like, alright. Here comes the sales pitch. So I instead of going into that speech, I just said, hey. Listen. Before we get too deep into this, can I tell you how our competitor is better than us? And I know that sounds crazy, but they just released an add on to their core solution that not only do we not have, but it's not even on our road map. And if that's gonna be an important consideration, I would love to vet that out now versus us get six months through this process. You do an RFP. We're flying all over the place. People are spending time. And then at the end, you're like, I wish you had that. Like, can we get that out now? And they're like, yeah. Tell us about it. I literally started selling the add on as though I was the competitor. I was like, here's what it does. Here's the results. Their first customer is in the apparel space. So, like, here's how it works. And, again, it's it's not really adhered to our core, so it's probably not something we're gonna do ever. Like, we would partner on it. They talked about it for a couple minutes more. They came back, and they're like, Todd, totally not important, and you're right. Like, why would we go to a reviews provider for that? Like, I don't know. But, apparently, somebody must be excited about it. We talked for only about five or ten minutes longer. Ten days later, they threw out the RFP process, didn't have us fly up, and the guy calls me to tell me that they just felt more comfortable with us. And as a result, they were throwing out that process and just gonna move forward. And that's when I burst into tears, and I was like, I guess I gotta write a book. But that I mean, that's that's the core. Right? Help the buyer predict. Your job isn't to sell. It is to sell, but your job is to help them make the best decision for them as quickly as possible, remove friction. And if that decision's not gonna be for you, how much time like, we've got a hoard, hoard time like a miser, right, that qualify these deals out faster. If that was gonna be important, man, that would have pissed me off if six months from now they would have said that was the reason they were going with the competitor. Well, you are quite literally taking the obstacles that you know are going to come up later on. You're literally running ahead of them 20 feet on the path and grabbing them and bringing them forward now so you can get them out of the way so that later on, you don't waste a whole grip of time further in the process. And so this deal went super smoothly. Right? Sounds like it went great. You didn't have to go through the grueling RFP. I remember seeing in the notes you had something around, like, why why learning negotiation skills from an FBI hostage blah blah blah is not good for us today. What's the deal with that? Because I know we have a lot of people who love our FBI hostage hostage negotiate. We're not negotiating the release of hostages from a bank heist. Right? We're negotiating a technology deal, a product deal, a services deal, whatever it is. And so this idea of why does trans or why does negotiation have to be any different than the rest of the process? And here's what I mean. Well, let's say you're selling a a SaaS solution. The the approach that you take when you're talking pricing when you're proposing pricing and then at the goal line is to say, hey. Listen. Our pricing is based on four things. There's four things that matter to us as an organization. The first one's volume, and we'll pay you in the form of a discount to commit to more volume. So higher volume commitment, there's discount schedules. We'll pay you in the form of a discount to commit to more. Number two, timing of cash. Turns out we like money. The faster you're willing to pay us, the better it is for us, the more we're willing to pay you in the form of a discount for that. Number three, length of commitment. The longer you commit to our products, technology, services, the better it is for us. More we're willing to pay you in the form of a discount. Number four is the timing of the deal. As it turns out, our ability to forecast is not only helpful for me and my rep and, you know, they got a quota. I don't know if you do that. And then, of course, like, every buyer knows you got quotas. But for our ability to resource the business, and we've got investors that I mean, you know that. So help us forecast. Let's mutually align around the timing of this thing, and I'll pay you on the form of a discount to hold to it. When it comes down to the customer saying, hey. I need a discount. Instead of you Tommy boying it and go, okey dokey, and, like, you know, here's 10%. Instead, you say, k. We might have a way to get there. Commit to more volume. Pay us faster. Commit longer. Help me forecast. And instead of eroding trust to the goal line you're building at, your deals are becoming more valuable because you've gotten out of the business of charity to the customer's bottom line. And your deal, if you especially if you use that fourth lever the right way, the deals become more predictable too. And so when we've implemented that at companies, I mean, the ROI on that process is, like, two days. It just it's magic how it works. And then if you're in a space where there's renewals, you'll find that if you reinforce that enough, your customers will start actually negotiating their own renewals too. And, again, for every dollar you give away in the form of a discount, you're getting something of value back. And it doesn't need to be, I need to read your iTwitches and mirror your language and all that stuff. It's just simple. Cards face up. Here's what matters to us. Let's let's trade. One of the things we talk about all the time is, look, you've gotta build up the ask internally, and then you've gotta trade whatever you need to move that deal forward in exchange for that ask. And so we talked about this in a negotiation play, but we'll say, like, look. Like, what you're asking me for is a lot. So the first thing is I need you to step forward because I'm not gonna go and negotiate against myself, and that's the first thing we need to return is we need to know what's gonna get this thing done. And then two, we're gonna do this thing one time, once. And if you're not ready to sign by this date, we should not be going through this ask right now because, otherwise, my CEO is gonna chop my head off, and we're both gonna lose our chance to win win this deal together. And by just cutting through all of the nonsense, you can actually get to the real answer as opposed to just fishing and giving away blind discounts to people without actually having any sense of are they willing to give up and put some skin in the game to actually get this thing done. Todd, one more question I have for you was something you put in the prep doc about putting text on slides and why that should be a big no no. And I'm wondering if you can talk a little about that. Oh, man. Alright. So, and there was something else earlier too you had talked about with, like, where tendency to lead with our NASCAR slide, like our logo slides and all that. I I'll I'll combine both of these for a second. The year of 1620, Francis Bacon, who is the founder of, like, the scientific method, he came up with this idea of something that has resulted in what we call cognitive bias, which is essentially logic is polarizing. When we've got an opinion and you throw logic at me, I will use that logic to support my opinion, even if your logic goes against my opinion. So you throw a logo slide at me, and it's really impressive and you're so proud of it. If I'm leaning towards you, I'll look at that logo slide and go, you know what? If they're good enough for them, they're good enough for me. Right? I'm gonna use it. But if I'm against you, I might look at that same logo slide and say, gosh. We're gonna be a small fish in a big pond. And I don't really see too many companies that are in my vertical. They're all over the place. Like, these guys generalists? Like, do they really know? So my point is with each one of your logic slides that you throw in, you're literally polarizing a consensus audience. And that's why you keep seeing that story sell. Right? Story sell. Well, they sell for a biological, you know, internal mechanism in our brains that stories and emotion, they bring us together. And in a consensus sale, you need to be telling stories where your customer is the hero, not you. Alright. I'll say that again. Tell a story where your customer is the hero, not you. And your story leads to you, not leads with you. Now to your point about text on slides, this is a new thing that I've discovered that I I kinda put the two things together. We actually read with our ears. So we're listening with our ears, and then I'm reading, and, basically, your brain is reading the words to yourself. I don't know. Like, if you're reading something, you're basically reading to yourself. So the same processing center is trying to process your spoken word and your written word. Brain is not wired to be able to do that. It it can't do that. It cannot listen with comprehension and read with comprehension at the same time. And as a result, if you're throwing text on slides, your customer is doing one of three things. They're choosing to read and not listen, they're choosing to listen and not read, or they're choosing to try to do both poorly. And, subconsciously, that exhaustion that it's causing the brain is causing them to completely disengage. So when I give a presentation, it's always images only, or it's me in a whiteboard, and we're start sketching stuff out. I just like, everybody, be careful. Your words should be one word here to reinforce something on a slide. If it's a quote, read the quote. But any other words, your paragraphs, you gotta get them out of there. So, like, realize you gotta get the clutter off of your slides. They're looking at a tiny little screen now. Get rid of the words. Tell stories that lead to you, not with you. Make your customer the hero, and use images to reinforce the words that you're saying, and it's going to make a huge impact almost instantly. Alright, Todd. This has been phenomenal. We've got one last question for you. What's one belief or piece of sales dogma that exists out there that you think needs to be scooped up, picked up, and dumped into the trash can because it's wrong? There's a data point now that says that it takes 18 touches when you're prospecting to get an executive to engage. Now there's some people that would look at that and go, damn it. I'm stopping at 10. I gotta add eight. I'm like, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. Like, why is it taking why are they rejecting the first 17? That's the question you should be asking yourself. Right? There's a reason that it's taking 18. It's because your content and your outreach strategy sucks. I see it in the numbers that we looked at from a pipeline load perspective where used to think, you know what? A rep at all times needs to have four x their quota in pipeline at any time. Right? And just like you always got a four x. Guess what that would cause the reps to do? Get four x, which means 75% of their stuff in their pipeline is crap. Right? But we force them to do that. You don't need 18 touches if your content's great. You don't need four x your pipeline if your deals are great. Right? There's an opportunity to think differently, and that's one thing that I'm trying to get people to realize. This has been one heck of an interview. We really appreciate your time. Is there anything that you wanna plug before we jump off here? No, guys. I just it was a blast being on here. If anybody wants to reach out, I but my goal is always the outcome. When I wrote the book, The Transparency Sale, I I literally thought there was a fifty fifty shot that it would suck. But I knew that I wanted to get these ideas out there, and it's it's done so well, which is amazing. But my goal has always been the outcome. So if you got questions, feel free to reach out to me, connect with me on LinkedIn, and, just let me know where you heard me. And then, again, if you want some more free stuff, I publish a blog. I do videos. You can find it all at transparencysale.com. Beautiful. Everybody, go check out the Transparency Sale. It's one heck of a book. Send Todd 18 different LinkedIn messages telling him that you heard him on the show, and stick around for a sixty second recap somewhat coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Todd Caponi include, number one, you gotta remove all your BS from the journey. Yes. You should do some disco before demo or sharing pricing, but you do not have to rate your customers over Kohl's. Chances are they're probably gonna need to get out of your way anyway if they're the type of customer who wants to see software or wants to get pricing in the first five minutes. So just get it out of the way. Number two, to that point, you don't need to hide price. You can get it out early. In fact, you can use it to disqualify early on and then focus on the stuff that actually matters. Number three, when they're asking about your competitors, do not hide, do not bad mouth. Tell them all the reasons your competitors are great and then focus on the things that they care about which is where you win. And then number four, negotiation does not have to be so over complicated folks. It's very simple. You anchor them at a certain point, you trade value for dollars, it's not all about saying the last three words or a certain tone and this and that, and that stuff is important. But the principles of negotiation don't have to be so over complicated. Alright, Nick. How can people help us out? Arman, sometimes when I'm stressed about my pipeline or hitting quota and laying awake late at night, I need to soothe myself to sleep. And the way that I do that is I read reviews of thirty minutes to presidents club on Apple podcasts. So if you haven't left us a review, I need some new reading material to soothe soothe my anxiety to sleep. We'll catch you guys next week on thirty minutes to presidents club.
