## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my host, Nick Skalski. And, folks, today, we have a three time thirty minutes to president's club hall of fame guest in the one and only, Maddie Jackson. She is a senior AE over at Webflow. She made president's club last year and is about to make president's club this year. I think by the time this episode is announced, she will probably have made it. Nick, why should people listen? So Maddie's last two appearances on the show, we went really, really deep on her discovery and deal process best practices. In this episode, we actually talk about how she is getting net new meetings and building pipeline to be able to run that discovery and deal process with. We get into everything from how she is divvying up accounts with her SDR, who takes which account, who takes which contact, how they come up with shared best practices for messaging and their outreach. She gets to do a really unique way that she gets meetings using an approach we frankly have not heard on this show before called the permission based introduction, which is not a permission based opener. It is a different way that she gets executives to connect her with their top lieutenants. If you're somebody who is looking to build more pipeline in a maybe more unique way than we've had past guests talk about, this one is one I would recommend if you listen to. Alright, Maddie. Welcome back to the show for round three. You might recall that we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get yours. My first actionable takeaway is during discovery, the number one question to rely on is the easiest to ask, and that is why. This exercise, it's simple. It's baking in the question why as sort of memory muscles so that anytime you're given any information from the prospect, you're relying on instinct to dig deeper. Very simple example of this is if prospect says we're looking to evaluate new software solutions this year rather than jumping into what are you using now, when are you looking to make a decision, taking a moment to step back and ask why, why are they looking to switch in the first place? A more nuanced example, and this is where I think all the gold lies, is if a prospect asks something more specific or gives you some specific information, like, I want Andrew to attend our next meeting. Making sure you ask why. Getting information on why that specific person is important to the evaluation can, of course, help set you up for the next meeting, make sure that there's an agenda that resonates with them, help you win over more stakeholders, build groundswell. It really is the simplest question to ask and often the one that is easiest to forget. Great. Why don't you tell us number two? Number two is lack of momentum kills all deals. So a very common sales saying is that time kills all deals, Something that my manager, Sean, at Webflow says is a great way to reframe this in a practical sense is to think about it as lack of momentum kills all deals. For example, rather than worrying about a sales cycle that's taking too long, it might be longer than your average sales cycle that you see, Trying to get that buyer, like, unnaturally onto your timeline, asking two questions. One, are we meeting regularly? And two, are the meetings that we're having moving us forward in the sales cycle? An example of that is if you're not meeting regularly, what can you do to get that back on track? It's much easier to generate momentum than it is to shift a buyer's timeline. Beautiful. Let's keep the momentum going. What's number three? Number three is providing a teachable moment. Whether you're doing cold outreach, whether it's technical validation, negotiations, they should always walk away with you having taught something. And the goal is to shift from traditional surfacing a problem, seeing if it resonates, to showing them how you can solve that problem. Specific example would be shifting from a cold outreach opener such as, hi, Andrew. Most companies who I speak to are using custom code to build their website. Experience content bottlenecks because of this with limited development resources. Does this resonate with you to something that's a little bit more teachable? Hi, Andrew. I noticed your website is built with custom code. We recently worked with the VP marketing at ABC company who was running into bottlenecks with their limited development resources. And by implementing Webflow, they were able to launch web pages four times faster without the need for those costly dev resources. Worth fifteen minutes of your time to show how. And that, I found, gets a lot higher of a response rate. Maddie, during the prep, you had some really interesting ways that you were using these teachable moments to get introductions from power to people on their team. Could you walk through what your above the line prospecting process looks like? Above the line, of course, you can try to reach out and book a meeting with the VP or with the CMO in my case directly, but my experience is that those folks are very busy, and they want you to come with a fully baked idea of how you can help solve their problem after you've spoken to other people and build groundswell. One thing that I do when reaching out to them is what I call the permission based introduction. It's common in sales to do a permission based opener. Hey. Is it a good time for me to pitch my product? This is more, is it okay if I reach out to this person to solve this problem? And what this looks like in practice is you're asking the person that you're reaching out to for permission to reach out to someone else who's usually on their team. I typically wouldn't do this if it were someone who was above the power line and you're asking someone below because no one's gonna put out their boss and be like, yeah. Go ahead. Reach out to John. He's gonna be thrilled to hop on a meeting with you. But going the other direction had a lot of success. Very important though, you must provide a reason why they should say yes, and you must be very specific with your ask. So could you give an example of what that might sound like? With those two specific guidelines, the incentive is gonna be providing value to that contact. Typically in a teachable moment, being able to show them this is a metric that I can help you with. It's a metric that people in your role typically care about, which is gonna be time to market, cost savings, increase efficiency, having a specific number tied to that. One value add that I like to use over here at Webflow is, hi, Andrew. Based on our Forrester TEI report, by using Webflow, companies like yours were able to improve content time to market by 94%. And then the second part, being specific with your ask, is rather than saying, is there someone on your team who I should reach out to about this? Asking, would it be fair to reach out to Angeline on the content marketing team to discuss your deployment processes and see if Webflow could increase efficiency in a similar way. Just making it really easy on them to say yes rather than even, like, coming up with a name in their mind. I've had it before where they've cc'd the contact, and that's gold. Obviously, that doesn't happen all the time. But even if they say a yes, you're then able to screenshot that, reach out to the contact, say, hey. Your VP marketing gave me permission or said that you might be the right person to talk to about setting up a demo. And if they say no, they they might just give you information as to why not. Maybe they just signed a multiyear contract with a competitor. Maybe they just went through a real big rebrand or refresh. Of course, they might just completely say no, but at least you shot your shot. You are reaching out to the VP of marketing and saying, hey. We can impact this metric that I know you care about and you are metricked on. Will you introduce me to one of your lieutenants? And you name that lieutenant the person who would actually action on implementing something like Webflow. Because the VP of marketing is not gonna get into the nitty gritty of that implementation, evaluation, etcetera. At least in the early days, you're making it easy to say, hey. I can impact this thing you care about. Get me with this person on your team, or could you get me with this person on your team? And so I think it's powerful because you're speaking to what the executive cares about, but you're not putting more work on their plate. So they reject you not because of interest, but because of bandwidth. There's a quote that I really like, which is the fastest way to get the right answer to something is to post the wrong answer on the Internet. What you're doing is when you're saying, hey. Would it be alright for me to connect with Arman Farrokh? The executive will be like, no. It's not Arman. You need to go get with Sean. And even if you're wrong in the person that you think you need to get with, you have a higher likelihood of getting a response and directed to the right person. If I think about a VP of marketing, they would have a director of content marketing, director of product marketing. There's probably someone that does web stuff that you're trying to get with. Who do you choose to ask for the connection with? And then two, like, where do you even figure out who that person is? I'm curious about, are you going on LinkedIn? Are you looking at a contact database? So primary source of truth for me has been LinkedIn, going through Sales Nav, looking at the account hierarchy, seeing if there's a persona who's at that company, who has the same title, same responsibilities as something that was a lookalike that closed. And then based off that teachable moment or that metric that I chose to use in the email to the VP, choosing a contact who's actually in charge of that. So showing that I've done my research, that I understand the space and the market and not going after someone who would be in charge of product launch and product marketing and making it about SEO or blog posts and something that the VP would immediately be able to sniff out, that's not the right contact. Of course, to your point, if you choose the the wrong contact, still totally fine. That's the thing. Like, I really find no one's gonna just completely write you off because you chose the wrong contact. If anything, they just feel a little bit more respected that you're not doing some generic outreach. You're not saying anyone you wanna introduce me to or anyone I can reach out to. You're at least trying to take that extra step, take something off of their plate, and asking if it's the right person to reach out to. How do you think about whether or not you just go for the meeting with power or you go for the meeting with the champion? I would, nine out of 10 times, rather take the meeting with a champion. The reason being, the champion's gonna give you information so you can show up better to power at the time that you need to. Like, a first meeting with someone at power, they might not have that much hands on day to day experience to experience all the pain. They might think that things are going well. They They might be able to provide some, like, top line business level metrics that are important to you, but dealing with the person who's actually experiencing the day to day pain, my experience towards the beginning of the sales cycle will lend itself to a higher close rate. How do you figure out what the executives or the VP of marketing or the CMO's priorities are so that when you deliver an insight, it's actually relevant to whatever they're working on? That depends on, of course, the company status. If it's a public company, reading any of the reports, going through their recent quarterly earnings, all of that can really give insight into what the company cares about. If it's private, trying to do as much research as you can. Maybe new releases, blog posts, maybe there's stuff on TechCrunch or online that you can read about the company. If not, then relying on information from the champion. So let's say you've got one of these meetings. What are the pieces of information that you know that you need about a company in order to run an effective first meeting? I love to look at who their investors are, when the most recent round of funding was, if there was a recent round of funding, what they're saying they're focusing that funding on. Oftentimes, it's something generic like growth, and then you can tie that into what is your acquisition strategy via web? What is your SEO strategy to reach more people? What is your CRO or conversion rate optimization strategy? Do you have any CRO tools in place? What are you using today? How is that going to affect whatever metric you now have in front of you based off of this new round of funding? Of course, you're gonna need to grow by x amount. What is that amount? Lots of follow-up questions that can come from just a simple round of funding or piece of information that you find in a blog post. Perhaps they acquired a new company. Maybe they're launching a new product. Those are all things that I see as really good, and you create compelling events and reasons to reach out. I also imagine you need to know some information about their tech stack, which is generally probably something that you can glean looking at their website. How do you figure out what their tech stack is without directly talking to somebody there? I'm lucky to be in a space where every website you can go and there's plugins that show what the website was built on. So if it's custom code, if it's one of our competitors, it's very public information how a website is built, what plugins they use. That's also really telling because I can see if they have plugins in their current tech stack that Webflow includes in our native ecosystem. And I can say, hey. We can consolidate. We can reduce total spend just by looking at these extensions and seeing what they're using with their website today. The other tip that I'll give you all is even though Webflow is obviously, like, super front facing, it's web infrastructure, you can do this more often than you think. So if you have any solution where your solution is facing the customer on the website, for example, if you're a chatbot at Drift or even if you have a login portal where your clients can log in to access their information, you can right click on the link to log in, and then you can click inspect in Google Chrome. And then if you toggle the sources, it will actually list out all of the major plugins that you're using. So for example, if you try this on 30mpc.com, you will actually see that all of our forms are HubSpot forms. You will see what we're using to track heat maps and clicks and all of that stuff. And so you can do this a lot more often than you would think to figure out what someone's tech stack is. It's not gonna work for things like back end dev tools where it's like an engineering person is using it on their own, and they're not actually using it on their site. But more often than not, you can figure this stuff out. Maddie, I'm curious. You're doing this outreach to above the line prospects. Are you just sharpshooting random accounts and then having your SDR work all the other ones? Are you doing above the line, below the line? How does this get coordinated with your SDR outreach? We have a weekly meeting that is specific to review the accounts that we're going to target the next week. So every Thursday, I meet with my SDR, and we go through accounts that I select. I always ask which accounts do you wanna target. Is there any messaging or anything that's resonating with you right now? Maybe it's previous closed lost accounts. Maybe it's customers using a specific competitor of ours. But I do select the accounts, and then I come up with a POV or point of view as to why we should be reaching out to them, which contacts we should reach out to, anyone above the line. We found it really helps if we're both on the email thread, of course, having two different people be able to reach out rather than one person. So taking that one two approach and having a really solid relationship if you're lucky enough to have an assigned SDR really helps with this hybrid targeted prospecting approach. You identify five accounts that you wanna reach out to and perhaps a POV on how you're going to break into those five accounts. From there, oftentimes, you're taking the folks above the line. Your SDR is taking folks below the line, or you're being very direct with how you want those folks to reach out to. Oftentimes, when you first pull your account list, there aren't any contacts on it. Was it on you to go pull those contacts yourself and make sure that you have the whole account mapped out? Or do you tell your SDR, hey. Here are these five accounts. Go map out the account. Bring it back, and then I'll tell you who we need to target. It's a both approach. I do take the initial shot of providing the contacts. Usually, I like to select at least three to five contacts per account for them to go after and then a few people above the line for myself. However, my SDR, she'll get on with me, and she'll show me Boolean searches. And she's, hey. You didn't find these 20 contacts that we could have gone after at this account. So it's highly encouraged for them to find other contacts and go a little bit wider, build that ground swell, usually using LinkedIn to find those people. For those who don't understand what a boolean search is or how to do it to find context, Could you explain how? Absolutely. So it's when you use quotations and then or to separate out those searches that you're doing, but you have it all in one long string. So an example that's relevant to my job is in marketing. There's a lot of different types of marketers, which we touched on. There's content marketing. There's growth marketing. There's product marketing. The time that it takes for me to type those in and then go through all the contact marketers, all the growth marketers, all the product marketers can be really saved if I just do a Boolean search of all three of those. So contact marketing or growth marketing or product marketing, and then it'll pull anybody with that title. We also see on LinkedIn, like, folks have the darnedest titles these days. There's a lot of different titles around there, so being able to capture everything that might be a fringe title that you think, but it's actually the perfect persona to go after, using a Boolean search has has really helped us uncover a lot more personas to go after. I have seen so many people miss contacts because they don't have all of the right permutations of the context. So, for example, they'll have CEO, but not founder. They'll have director of marketing, but not dir of marketing, d I r of marketing. So build a massive list of titles that you can plug into whatever contact enrichment tool you are using, run that through, or you can use the filter search where you filter by department and seniority. For example, show me all people in marketing above the manager level, but the best SDRs are the ones who are doing both. You have to make sure that the SDRs are literally pulling every single corner of the account to make sure that every single contact has been covered. Mandy, you talked about giving your SDRs a POV as to why you picked this account and who you should reach out to. I've seen POVs that look like looks like a hot lead, and that's about as much context that the SDR gets. How much detail are you giving to your SDRs on why they should reach out to an account, or what's an example of what you would give them? An example would be this company just raised a series d. They got $60,000,000. These are some of our shared investors. Love looking for that too. This is a contact who looks like they own growth, says that growth is something that they're focused on over the next three years. Let's reach out and see if we can get a meeting with someone who's either them or on their team to understand what that means and what the website plays in that growth strategy. Keeping it vague too for that first POV, like what does the website mean to that strategy, could be more beneficial than saying, what is their conversion rate optimization metric and how many days do they have to achieve that? Because sometimes they might not have thought of these, and that's where you got into sort of that education stage during the actual deal cycle where you're educating them on how your product can help them with that growth. They might just have a very high level goal. How do knowing their investors how how does that actually inform your prospecting? Knowing their investors is helpful specifically to get actually introductions from the investors. If there's a portfolio company that's a shared investor, I'll reach out to my CEO directly. She's always willing to lean in, and I'm like, what are your contacts over at Excel who are willing to introduce us to this company? And they love doing that. They love connecting portfolio companies, seeing if we can help each other. That's a really, really great one if we can do that. So you have these POVs. You work with your SDR. Five accounts per week, you pass them the five accounts. From there, do they just say, okay. Peace. I'm gonna go. Is there any back and forth where they're drafting the emails or sending it to you? What does the actual SDR do from there? There's a lot of back and forth. So we use Slack heavily. We've got pod channels with myself, my SDR, both of our leaders inside of it, and we will coordinate on Outreach what it looks like. I have a lot of trust in my SDR, so I'm like, you really don't need to run every email by me. But if you want guidance, I'm always willing to provide it, or I can hop in. One of the great things about our technology is that if my SDR sends an email without me on CC, I can actually hop in and respond to that email and sort of, like, force myself into the chain. So I'm like, you can try whatever you want, but please let me know when you want me to come in and help you with some of these below the line contacts to see if we can't push it forward. At what point do you hop in to a email thread or a series of emails where there's been no response? What determines when you decide I'm gonna spend my sales calories on this effort? If I see someone from that company has been visiting our website a lot or they've been checking us out on LinkedIn, then, of course, I'm willing to spend more sales calories on that. I'm like, there's something there. There's someone there. We will find them, and we will get a meeting. If it's very cold and it's just an account that looks like a good fit, but we might not have a lot of information, maybe there's not much publicly available, we're doing some generic outreach, that's where I'll let my SDR take the lead and try to run those cycles themselves until we get something back. But at that stage, I need to be focusing on my pipeline or hotter weeds. I wanna double down on what you said, which is you have a lot of trust with your SDR today, but there's a ton of back and forth, especially at the beginning, and that trust is built over time. And whenever I was pairing up an SDR and AE, I would always recommend that they treat it like a shuttle run. So if you've ever trained in sprints, you've done shuttle runs where first you run five yards and then you run back, and then you run 10 yards and then you run back, and then you do 25 and then 50. And each time you go a little bit further. So the first time, you might pass your SDR five accounts with the POV, and then you might say, hey. Come back and just show me what else you found on the research. And then second time, 10 yards, you might say, hey. Now show me the contacts you think we should reach out to. Third time, okay. Write the emails. Show me the emails. Fourth, fifth, sixth time, then they're sending the emails all the way on their own. But the problem is what a lot of AEs do is they send their SDR to the 100 yard line first. They say, here are the first five accounts you should reach out to. Go reach out to all of them, and let's see if you book any meetings. And then they literally have to fix every part of the process where they missed a contact, they messed up an email, or whatever it was. And so be tighter at the beginning, manage to a tighter circle, and then over time, give them more and more creative freedom. One thing I love about that approach, Armand, is treating your SDR like the sales professional that they are and not doing all of the work and saying this is who you're gonna reach out to. This is what you're gonna say. This is how to say it, and this is when, because they're way more capable than that. And they can actually go out in these sort of bits and pieces, expand their knowledge and eventually be able to fully write a POV, find the right contact, find the right account too. You're closing these, like, big, pretty meaty deals that require a lot of work. How do you think about the amount of time that you spend on advancing current pipeline versus creating new pipeline? And how do you actually fit that into the rhythm of your schedule? It's really important to have balance there. It does depend on the time of year, the time of month. Right now, it's the end of our fiscal year, so I am hyper focused on closing deals. But, of course, I have a lens out to next quarter. We're always forecasting for the next quarter, so we can see in my one on ones with my manager. Do I have three x coverage? Do I have four x coverage? And then if I don't, am I booking enough meetings? Am I generating enough pipeline dialing back that sales funnel where it's how many meetings do I need? How many emails, calls do myself, my SDR need to do in order to book those meetings? Maybe I need to up it from five accounts a week to 10 accounts a week. Maybe I need to get in there in the trenches and do some more outreach to people who might be a director, not just VPs in C suite, based on how much pipeline I have on a rolling basis. So doing that check weekly will help inform how much time I'm spending on either or. But, of course, should be always focused on both. Starting the beginning of the year, you are probably going to be passed a new territory, a new patch, and you and your SDR are gonna have to hug your accounts and wave them goodbye. And then you're gonna get a new batch of however many accounts, and you're gonna have to figure out where you start. I'm curious if you have any advice for people who are just carving into their new territory today. For folks who are just carving into a new territory, I'd say take the time to learn it. Like, you have the time to learn your new territory at the beginning of the year, dive in now versus diving in in two, three, four months because you're gonna need that extra runway. In terms of do you reach out if you know that you have accounts leaving, I like to think it's sales karma. I hope that whoever has the accounts that I will be inheriting at the beginning of the year is also doing that outreach and treating them well so that it all lands in a good place when we do the account reshuffle. You said it's important to learn your new territory. What actually goes into that? Could you give some specific examples? At Webflow, we sell into all types of verticals. Of course, everybody needs a website, so I think that's really important in terms of which are your typical companies that are gonna close, which are the high touch point ones that are gonna need a lot in terms of security review, legal review, financial review. What might be something that is on the smaller side, but looking at historical growth? What's the employee count? What was the employee count over the past three years? These are all signals that you can get from LinkedIn. And I like to break it out and slice my territory in that way so so that I have my high priority accounts. We've got, like, the green accounts. We've got yellow. We've got red, the things that you're like, I I don't think this is ever gonna come in. Maybe let's not focus time on it. If they do, great, but not cold outreach. How do you spend time differently across your green, yellow, and red accounts? I typically focus on green. So that's something that I identify as a top account, something that's a big bet. And I know that if we were to land it, it would be a high contract value and a very good logo to work with in terms of expansions, renewals, retention. Yellow accounts would be something that I focus with my SDR, so they're the ones who are primarily working those. Very easy to shift to. You do it at the beginning of the year, or you do it when you get your accounts. A red can become a yellow, can become a green. You never know. Could you give an example using Webflow of what a green account would look like and what a yellow or red account would look like? A green account would be someone let's say they're using WordPress, one of our largest competitors, and they're in a highly regulated industry. That's important for Webflow because as a PLG company, we do have a self-service platform. On enterprise, there's advanced collaboration, advanced security, advanced support, things that people in the financial space really care about. So if it's a fintech company with 600 employees, they're growing rapidly, and they're using one of our main competitors, I will definitely mark it as a green account. A yellow account could be someone that is either in that space. So let's say fintech, just to keep the example the same. And maybe they're not using a competitor of ours, or maybe it's wishy washy. We don't have that sort of silver bullet to to go after. Or someone that is using a competitor, everybody has a website. Maybe they're a dog grooming business, and they've got 50 locations across The US. And you're thinking, there's actually a lot of people who work here, and they care about bringing in new customers, but it's not fitting our ICP. Let's mark them as yellow. It sounds like two big variables, size of the prize and likelihood of closing. Yeah. Size of the prize is a million doggy day cares or whatever it is. Wow. Like, I don't know if they're on WordPress, but pretty big deal if we end up closing it. Likelihood to close would be, okay. Great fit because they're using a competitor in a regulated industry. Even if it's a smaller account, it's probably gonna be a quick, easy, single deal because I know we win in that sweet spot. And then to answer your question about Red, because I'm super bullish about everybody having a little bit of a chance, red for me is they don't have a website or the website that they have is not mission critical to the business. So it's just like a brochure site. There's no call to action. There's no sign up here. You mentioned that your patch is about 200 accounts. How many of those are green, yellow versus red accounts? I keep 30 to 50 of them green, about a 130 of them yellow, and then the rest would be red. I would be thrilled to see a red out of my name and move something else in there. Maddie, this has been a fun episode. Thank you for sharing all of your prospecting secrets and talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. And now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of sellers exhibiting that you think they need to break because some more gonna helps. One bad habit that I see a lot of sellers exhibit, including myself, is focusing on why a prospect is going to buy. So building out that business case, being able to speak to it in a deal review internally, the why, why, why, why Webflow, why now, why it's a perfect fit, all the metrics, rather than focusing on why not. Why would they not buy? Where is this deal going south? If you're able to answer that question at every stage of the deal, you gonna have a lot higher likelihood of closing it just like discovery. It's gonna shift. Like, maybe it's some technical reason at the beginning. Maybe towards the end, it has to do with pricing or cash flow. There's all these different reasons that it can be. But if there's no reason why they won't buy, you're probably not doing your job well enough because there always is. Phenomenal. Matty, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Matty Jackson. What do you have for your two? So number one is called the permission based introduction. The way that Maddie does this is she identifies an executive, and then she identifies a top lieutenant of that executive. An example would be she identifies the VP of marketing, and she asks for an introduction to the director of product marketing. In her outreach to that VP, however, she will speak to an executive level metric that that VP cares about and then talks about how Webflow can support that metric and asks for an introduction to the lieutenant who would actually run with the Webflow project. So that's the first one, the permission based introduction. The second one from Maddie is when you are thinking about reaching out to a company, yeah, you probably wanna look at have they raised money recently because that might be an indication that it's a good account. But Maddie goes one layer deeper, and she looks at the funding announcement, and she specifically looks at what is that funding supposed to be used for. Because that indicates, oh, they've got money to accomplish x. Her outreach now is here's how we can help you accomplish x. So, yes, look at funding announcements, but understand the why behind why they raise money in the first place. Number three. When you're divvying up accounts between an AE and an SDR, an AE should select the accounts, build a point of view on why those are the right accounts, and oftentimes craft specific messaging for above the line prospects while SDRs work below the line or carefully work above the line with their AEs guidance. And then lastly, number four, when you are tiering out your accounts, tier them out green, yellow, and red based on the biggest size of the prize and the highest likelihood to buy. You should have about 30 to 50 green accounts, 130 yellow accounts, and 30 to 50 red accounts if you have a 200 account book. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So we got into this a little bit in this episode about how Maddie is tearing up her new territory, and we actually put together a guide at thirty MPC called how to tear up your territory. There's a link in the show notes that talks about how you should be thinking about your different account criteria, which accounts should get the most personalization, how you actually think about putting muscle into the important accounts and semi muscle into the not as important accounts and no muscle into the irrelevant accounts. So there's a really, really good guide. Armond, you put it together with a lot of the stuff we've learned from past guests. So check it out. It's in the show notes, and we will see you next week on the show notes.
