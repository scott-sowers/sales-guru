## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. I'm your host today, Nick Sigelski, and I am joined with a more frequent contributor here at thirty minutes to presidents club, Jen Allen Knuth. And we've got a amazing episode today with Brian. He's an AE over at Gong. Jen, why should people listen? Okay. So there is plenty of advice out there on how we sellers run a great first call. But how the heck do we keep momentum going on calls two, three, 45, and so on? So Brian from Gong is gonna break down exactly how he keeps that momentum going. Everything from how does he wrap up his first call to what does he do in between calls, all the way down to what happens when we encounter that dreaded stakeholder who's super skeptical of our offer. This is a really great episode. I'm so excited to be part of this. Alright. And a three, a two, a one, I'm excited too. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive goes to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Brian. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Appreciate you having me. Number one is how to craft personalized emails fast and at scale with what I created is the ops framework. It's four steps to create every email where you lead first with an observation. Second, you share a problem that resonates with that persona. Third, you insert a PS at the end of the email to make it scream human and that it's personalized. And four, you leave off with a simple CTA, something like ever heard of us before or interested. I love it. What's tip number two? Tip number two is really understanding the discovery is not just a a stage in the sales process, but it's something that we need to continue throughout every conversation. And in particular, the demo, you have a really great opportunity to go layers deeper from what you learn and potentially either the first call or just the beginning of that exact same call. So instead of asking questions like, hey. I'll pause there, Nick. Any questions? Reframing that to, hey. What has stood out the most so far? Or asking something like, hey. Who else would get value from these insights you see right now? I have four different questions that I have memorized that allow me to go layers deeper throughout the demo and can really be used at any point in the sales process versus some of those more generic questions that'll just simply get the answer. Nope. All good. Beautiful. Round us out, Brian. What's number three? Yeah. Number three, on that same vein, is really incorporating discovery is not just that first call, but continuing to build on what you learned from call one into the second call, into the third call, and into the fourth call. How I built out a really scalable and repeatable way to do that is after every first call, pretending that this is the second conversation today, what I'm gonna lead with is one slide called what we've heard or what we've learned. And I'm gonna start to bold out at the top. Hey. This is your strategic priority. This is where you're at today in terms of your current state. This is where you're trying to get to in terms of your ideal state. And then any other details that they've shared with me around the ROI, the potential from a project or initiative like this. It also helps articulate while you create that and while you build that, what gaps you have so far so that you can use that slide as a launching point to go even deeper and start to learn more into discovery after sharing that. Beautiful. By the way, great job, Brian. Really good stuff. Alright. So, Brian, we were talking about on the prep for this. You're doing some really, really intentional things after the first meeting to sell between meetings, to make sure that the new stakeholders you're meeting with are up to speed, to fill in your gaps in terms of, hey. You understand 70% of what you probably need to do to get the deal done, but you gotta get that other 30%. Before we get into all of the stuff that happens in meetings two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 11, talk to me about meeting one. You're obviously not getting everything from the customer, but my guess is there are certain things or certain pieces of information that you're trying to pull out on that first call with a buyer. Maybe it's problems they're looking to solve, people who need to be involved, buying process timeline, etcetera. But talk to me about first call. What are your goals, and what are you trying to pull out from the customer? Yeah. Number one thing I wanna get from that first call is latching on to their top strategic priority that, hopefully, I can anchor on throughout the entire sales process. How I'm gonna actually uncover that is by showing up with a point of view on a call, if I'm with a chief revenue officer as an example, I'm gonna come having done some research already, and I'm gonna say something along the lines of, hey, Nick. I saw that the team was rolling out MEDDPIC, which is a, you know, really big initiative to roll out a new sales methodology. Is that the number one initiative you're driving towards here in September, or does anything trump that as an even larger priority today? What that does is it'll build credibility that you did your research, you did your homework, and there's two really great outcomes. They either say, one, yes, that's the number one strategic priority, and you can dig deeper and deeper, or they'll say, hey. That's really big. But, actually, this piece over here is an even larger priority today. Everything really will anchor around that top strategic priority. From there, I wanna make sure I can get any other, like, requirements out of a first call that would make sure it's a good fit. For my company, it has to be able to integrate with certain pieces of technology. So I'll make sure to incorporate some of those questions later in the conversation just to make sure it's worth both of our time to continue the conversation. The other piece is just starting to get a sense as to how they're thinking about the problem in terms of, like, where they're at today and where they're hoping to get it to. And, ideally, starting to quantify, like, what that would be worth in terms of revenue potential. Why I think that's really important to get out of call number one is if your solution costs a $100,000 and their number one priority that they're going after is only worth 50 k in revenue potential, you're probably not the best solution for them, and that's totally okay. But, conversely, right, if what they're targeting is worth, you know, 7 figures plus and your solutions are on 50 k and you're able to help directly with some of their top strategic priorities, it can really set the foundation for the rest of the sales cycle. I love that. I love giving them something to react to versus just asking an open ended question. So one of the things I think is sometimes problematic or difficult is when and how long you take to prep. So you talked about the ops framework for your email you're sending them. Is that when your prep is starting, or or how do you think about prep and how long does it typically take you? Yeah. I I think I begin prep once I have that first meeting scheduled. I like to do really in-depth first call prep, but I don't wanna necessarily do that before I've at least been able to set a meeting and have their commitment that they're willing to invest some time as well. Prep used to take me closer to twenty five to thirty minutes, and I took pride in that in some fact of, like, how much research and effort I was putting in. I was able to cut that down to closer to ten to fifteen minutes. And how I was able to do that, I built out a template for my pre call prep of certain information that I knew was a nonnegotiable that I needed to come into the first call with. As an example, a simple org chart of understanding stakeholders that need to be involved at a certain point in the process if the cycle were to continue. In my world, that could be enablement, that could be sales ops, that could be account executives or a chief revenue officer. Other pieces of pre call prep starting to understand their technology stack, if they're public or if they're private. If there's anything in the news recently. So I'll simply just put their company name into Google and hit that news icon. Why I have that template built out is there's a lot of different pieces that I wanna go through and make sure I'm fully prepared to. And it kinda takes the mind work out of it of trying to remember all those 10 or 15 different details, and I can just instead go straight down in order and and make sure I'm really thorough in what I need to understand to show up to that first call and and crush it. Well, what's really great about this, Brian, is this prep that you're doing actually then informs what ends up happening in said meeting. You are now showing up with a point of view on, hey. This is the problem that I suspect you are dealing with. The one that suspect you are dealing with. The one that you shared was, hey. You're rolling out medic or med pick, and my guess is there's some stuff associated with that. But then you're also figuring out who are the other stakeholders that I probably need to have a conversation with. And when you show up saying, here's the problem I think you have, and here's the people I think we need to involve, if you're right with both of those, holy cow. You've made things so much easier for the buyer to be like, yeah. That's right. Let me get you with the team. And now all of the hard work of multithreading and navigating their org, like, it's so easy because you basically did the job for them. So, so different than most salespeople who show up. They're like, so tell me about your problems. Tell me about your priorities. Tell me about your challenges, which is not terrible, but now the buyer's like, alright. Let me catch you up to speed. And even if you're wrong with that POV, at least you're showing that you came with some level of prep, and they're you're never gonna be a 100% wrong, a 100% wrong. So let's talk about the end of that first call. You've done a good job. They were fairly aligned on the POV and the problem. You know the stakeholders that you need to connect with. I know that you know how you sell Gong probably better than someone knows how to buy Gong. You were talking about being prescriptive in your selling process. Talk to me about the last five to eight minutes of that meeting and where you direct the buyer from there. The first five to eight minutes, I'll I'll call out that piece because you need the necessary time, first and foremost, to be able to close out any call efficiently. So just keep in mind, showing that additional feature is never worth it to crunch yourself on time. You can always set up that additional call. I aim to have at least ten minutes left of every call even if it's just a thirty minute conversation to make sure that I can learn their feedback and then prescribe a next step as well. What that process typically looks like, I I typically structure the last call, pretty similarly no matter if it's early stage or later stage. But I'll ask them a pretty simple question. I'll just say something along the lines of, hey, Nick. I know what you shared earlier was that med pick initiative is super, super critical to this year's revenue success. From what I shared with our solution today, curious from you on a scale of one through 10, how compelling were we and why? Why ask for the one through 10 is because it's gonna start to quantify how compelling it actually is. What I've learned is that if somebody answers, if you don't give them that quantification, type one through 10, and just ask them, hey. How compelling was today, or did you like what you see? They could say, yeah. We loved it. This is really exciting. This is really interesting. But that's not really gonna tell you, hey. Are they ready to move forward in the next couple months, or is this something that they would maybe wanna prioritize a year from now? The second follow-up question to that one through 10 is if they say an eight or a seven, I'm gonna say, hey. What would have made it a 10? What's the gap? That can start to draw out potential objections where they say, hey. Loved everything I saw, but I would just ultimately need to use it or see it firsthand or talk to another customer. Now you can start to build an action plan based off any objections they shared. I'll run a little bit discovery around whatever they share would have made it a 10, maybe ask another follow-up or two. And then once I feel like I'm ready to actually prescribe a next step, I'll ask first, hey. Nick, are you open to a recommendation? I will wait until they say yes. Sometimes they'll be taken aback that I'm actually asking them for permission first. And then I'll make a really strong recommendation and say, hey, Nick. Given what you share that you would ultimately need to talk to another customer, I'd recommend I can set you up with a reference in the next couple of days. You can have that conversation by Friday of next week, and then maybe you and I regroup on Monday once you've had the chance to have that conversation. How does that sound to you? Being really prescriptive is buyer centric versus just asking them something along the lines of what do you think for next steps? They're not gonna know. Right? They haven't bought your solution before. They maybe have never bought technology before. So you really need to guide them from point a to point b. Okay. So when you're making prescriptive recommendations, which by the way, I love because we all know buyers have a hard time buying, do you find that there's, like, a common, like, three or five that end up almost always working, or is it truly unique for every different sales call? What's your experience with that? I typically start for, like, prescribing a certain recommendation. It actually starts back with that pre call prep. So before I even enter that first call or second call or call number 11, I have jotted down a couple of options in terms of, like, ideal next steps. It could be setting up a greater demo. It could be setting up a pilot. It could be having them speak to a customer. It could be looping in a sales engineer to walk through our Salesforce integration. There's probably, like, 10 different plays that I could be thinking of. But why I wanna do that strategy piece upfront is because I need to think about, like, where we're at in the cycle and where we're ultimately getting to. If I'm not at the right stakeholder yet, I need to kinda steer the conversation in a certain way to make sure that we're able to loop in the correct people that need to be involved with that cycle to ultimately give them the best chance, to get a solution like this in their hands. So what you're doing is really, really brilliant here. You have essentially 10 ish plays that are your commonly leaned on next steps that you know are the right thing for the buyer to do next that also align with what's right for how you need to manage your pipeline, Brian. And what you're doing at the end of these calls is you're saying, hey. Scale of one to 10, how are we feeling? And if they give you a 10, my guess is you have one to three plays that you would then recommend next next based on if they're, like, a nine or a 10. If they're a six or a seven, my guess is you have other plays that you lean on. So you essentially build out this flowchart of based upon where the buyer sits on that very specific pH scale that you've made, it then informs the next steps that you pull out of your toolkit, and it's really, really sharp. I'm I'm probably gonna need to steal that one. I wanna talk about a common scenario where, let's say, you're meeting with a VP of sales for a particular segment. Great call. Things go well, and they say, Brian, like, you know, we're feeling pretty good about this. I appreciate your recommendation. You know, the next thing that we really need to do is I want you to show a a big demo to a couple other of my VPs who handle other segments. Right? They're pulling another stakeholders, which is good, but there's also room for risk where you might have people who have no idea why they're in that meeting. They're not oriented around the problem, and they say, let's do this in two weeks. And And they give you times and you get this thing booked. Talk to me about what happens between the meeting ending and when that big team meeting happens. There's two keys in my opinion. Number one is keeping your champion or in this case, that decision maker, that VP of sales engaged and continuing to be a part of the conversation. To your point, I think one of the areas of risk is where they say, hey. Go speak with x, y, and z, and I'll regroup after. You need to be prepared to push back and make sure that they're able to join that call and give their perspective on the value they've seen. Why that's so important is who does it mean more, right, coming from you, the sales rep, or that internal DM shedding light on how much value they've seen so far? An example of how I would push back is saying something like, hey, Nick. Given I know you shared x y z was the number one priority that you need to nail in the next sixty days, and, ultimately, it's worth north of 7 figures. Could I ask for you to stay included on that call? Would love to have your perspective in addition to Jen's when it comes to how we can help x, y, and z. So that's the first piece, making sure you can keep your champions and, you know, if you have the decision maker already, continue to be engaged. The second piece is actually engaging those newer folks and making sure that their opinions feel valued, right, and feel heard and that they're not just like a check the box type of thing before you ultimately move forward. What I'll do is before an additional presentation like that later stage, I'll actually single thread each of the stakeholders on the upcoming call and pretending for a second that's Jen in this case. I'll send Jen a short note saying, hey, Jen. So excited to speak with you next Thursday. I've heard only great things from Nick. Would love to hear prior to that meeting, is there anything you're keen on learning or interested to hear when it relates to, you know, your specific role or your specific organization? Looking forward to hearing back. So I'll send that note ahead of time. I'll very frequently get a reply on that probably north of 70%, especially if you're able to add a little bit of personalization and flare specific to their role or some of their priorities you've heard. And then making sure to just continue to go deeper and deeper on that once you're on that call with not only the new stakeholder, but your existing champion as well. One of the things you were talking about in our prep call was how you're operationalizing working your deals in between scheduled meetings. Can you share what that sort of daily battle rhythm looks like for you? I start every single day the exact same way. Once I get online for work that is, and I've done this for the last four years, I'll dedicate about fifteen to twenty minutes, and I'll go through my active pipeline. And I'll go through my opportunities one by one, whether I'm an SDR or whether I'm an AE. This would work for account managers or CS as well. But I'll simply ask myself the question, hey. This opportunity with Acme Corp, is there anything I can do today, Thursday, here in September to advance this deal in any way? I'm gonna think about it for a minute or two if there's additional case studies I could send. Maybe I'll reference back to my previous conversation and start to think, hey. What questions were they asking? Is there any additional value that I can provide before our next meeting the following week? So I'm gonna go through all of my active opportunities, all of my active deals, simply ask myself that question, And I'm gonna action on my to do list and basically walk away from those 15 saying, hey. I'm gonna send these two a case study. I'm gonna send these two an integration video with their CRM that they're really curious to see. I'm not gonna touch these six accounts because I've I've done a lot recently. I've gotten a lot from them. And this other account, I'm gonna add them on LinkedIn today. Because anything you can do to earn mind share with them for even just fifteen or thirty seconds and get them to think about your company and Brian for a second in a positive light, that's a win. We need to keep in mind as sellers, well, Acme Corp and that 100 k deal might be my number one priority in life or at least at at my company. It's probably their thirtieth or fortieth priority if that. So anything to win Mindshare for a minute or two in a positive light before your upcoming meeting is a big win. I love that, and I love the no ask. You know? It's just low effort. It's reminder. It's being thoughtful. So let me ask you something that used to happen to me all the time. You do what you think is a great first meeting, and then they get kinda silent. At what point do you start to pull back, and how do you make that decision once you're post first call? It's challenging. Right? I think just thinking about the selling environment over the past couple years, most sellers feel like they don't have enough pipeline today or wish they had more coverage, which I think can ultimately make us wanna hold on opportunities and deals longer than we actually should. But you need to know at the same time when enough has been enough, and you'd actually be better served closing out the opportunity or cutting bait and focusing on your existing pipeline of actively engaged or even building up net new pipeline. I don't think there's one silver bullet or one rule like, hey. This is when you cut bait. This is when you stop. If somebody starts to go dark or starts to ghost you per se, but I think it's more an accumulation of factors. As an example, if there's a couple of red flags that come to mind, I'd be more likely to. What those look like for me is if I'm not speaking with power, meaning I'm only speaking, like, the manager level or the director level, I know I likely need to get to the C Suite to win the deal. If I start to have somebody go dark and they're lower level, I haven't even won the real battle yet, which is getting the power and getting the right folks involved. So I'm I'm probably gonna cut bait pretty early. Other signs could be just in terms of, like, their strategic priorities. If they're not that big of priorities, they're not that pressing, they don't have that much pain that you've uncovered, it just might not be a priority. You might not be a perfect fit. If there's anything from a tech perspective as well where they don't integrate quite perfectly or there's some more challenges from a a technical perspective, that might make me more likely to as well. So just an accumulation of factors. But I think going back to to what I'd shared in terms of, like, how you start every single day in terms of strategizing your active pipeline, when you go through and you start to strategize and think about that account and you look back and you say, hey. I've sent three notes to them, but I'm not at power. They have some technical challenges as well. I haven't heard from them in three weeks. It's probably time to turn a closed loss and move on to the next. And on that note, so one of the things that can be awkward, right, is, like, you have this great first call with someone. Do you message that back to them? Like, I hate calling it a breakup because nobody likes a breakup with a prospect. But, like, how do you think about when you just silently go off and when you actually message back? And if you do message back, what do you say? Yeah. I try to anchor back to value. So if you are using any solution that captures your calls or your initial conversations, review back and listen to what they shared with you. If you feel like you had that really great first call or second call, listen back and remind them what got them so excited on that call in the first place. I'm then gonna demonstrate specifically that in the email because it's gonna start to build up some, like, hey. I'm really putting in the work as a seller, and I really want to help earn this partnership. So one of those examples might be like, hey, Jen. Just had a chance to relisten to our call from the August, and I heard you say that this would be a game changer around x, y, and z, and I might actually quote them or link to a snippet of the call. I'll then add a little bit more value and say, hey. Wanted to provide this article here on exactly how we do this or an example of how x y z customer leveraged this and saw, you know, a million dollars in revenue as a result. And then I'll go for my ask and say, given I know how big of a priority that was through end of year, would love to share a couple of ideas I had in terms of next steps or tease at something and offer up a couple times. Yeah. It's really interesting. One of the things that you're doing here is you're taking a very short snippet of the discovery call or whatever call you had with the customer, and you are taking the words they use. And you're not saying, hey. As a reminder, here's the whole thirty minute call recording. Go listen to it at the minute twelve mark. You're actually sending the snippet. I'm curious. Are there any other, like, creative things that you're doing, like, where you're leveraging the call recording during sales process? Yeah. Great question. One thing I I'm a big fan of is being able to sell between the meetings and keeping them engaged. So I know I mentioned those no ask value touches, but I love putting together, like, a digital sales room for them. And I'll actually tell the prospect, like, hey. I'm gonna continue to add this throughout the sales cycle or the sales process. Make sure to bookmark it and come back to it frequently. So I'll use that digital sales room to add the demo from the first conversation, maybe a piece of collateral around a similar customer and the results they saw or our g two reviews. And then two weeks from now, I'll add our pricing sheet once I've had the chance to review that. So I'm starting to build this hub that they can continue to come back to. It's also really easy for them to share and socialize something like that with other stakeholders. So I'll make sure to write in it. Like, even if I've only spoken with Nick and Jen so far, I'll write, hey, Nick, Jen, and Acme Corp team, comma, and I'll write a short little personalized message in that digital sales room. One area that I've struggled in my sales process is new stakeholders get added to the conversation, especially when things start to go well. And I'll have all of this information I had and all of these notes and all of these call recordings and a great digital sales room and, like, buckets and buckets of info about the problem, how our solution matches, all the tech integrations, etcetera. And then one of the most frustrating thing is is I meet with, I don't know, a director of sales operations, and they have zero context for why they're even on that meeting, what's going on, who we are, what the problem we solve. And it's like, oh my gosh. I'm starting back at square one. And I'm wondering, are you doing any any particular things to, like, brief that person? I know you talked about that pre meeting email, but I'm wondering, like, what fix might you prescribe to someone like me who's showing up to meetings, and it's like, we're at square negative one. Two things. One, I would make sure to engage with them in some fashion before that meeting. So if you do have a digital sales room in that email when you single thread them, you could include that and say, hey. We've also been building out this, our company plus your company name, digital sales room. Make sure to give it a check before our call. So it's gonna start to get them familiarized. Hopefully, they start to go down a rabbit hole and learn a little bit more. The second piece is once you're on that call, let your champion start to sell for you as well. So I'm gonna tee up my champion in a conversation like that and say, hey, Jen. Mind sharing with Nick all the value you've seen so far and why we're investing, you know, forty five minutes today to learn if if this can be a potential solution for x y z company. So giving them the opportunity and the stage to do some of that selling for you and just leaning on on your champions throughout the process. So what do you do? I I wanna play off next situation. What do you do if you get that sales ops person? They're like, I don't even think we should be looking at this right now. I'll probably start to reverse them and start to ask them more questions about uncovering their world and their priorities. If they strictly told me something like, hey. This isn't a good idea. It's not a fit right now. I would just ask a short question back and say, hey. I appreciate you offering your perspective there. Curious why you don't feel like it's a good fit for the company right now. And then start to run discovery off of that. At a certain point, though, what I'm gonna try to get to is saying, hey. Putting our company aside, would love to learn your role for a second. When you think about, like, Jen's top two priorities or top three priorities now through October, what are you most focused on? Start to uncover their world a bit and then see if your solution can ultimately tie back and make their life easier in any way. What I I love about that is that you don't just run to objection handle. Right? Like, you let them feel heard. You let them feel understood. It's discovery. Like you said in the beginning, it's discovery all throughout the process. It's an excellent example of it. Well and then one of the other things that you get out of that is you can actually advise the customer of the risks related to an implementation, where you might go back to the CRO and say, hey. I just want you to know, like, I met with Jen, your head of sales ops, and Jen is gonna be pretty heads down the next five weeks focused on implementing some other system. And there's definitely some stuff we can do to make sure that she doesn't get bogged down with the setup there, but, like, know that that's a risk upcoming. And what happens here is when you call out risks, folks are no longer afraid of this behind the shroud. What's gonna happen when we buy Gong? They have a very clear picture of, hey. Here's where things could go wrong. And folks are okay with taking on risk when they know exactly what that risk looks like. And that's what you're uncovering there, Brian. And I'm kicking myself because I wish I had talked about that earlier because we're gonna have to do a part two at some point with you. This was really, really good. But, sadly, we're running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. What's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? One thing I've seen some sellers new, some even veteran sellers, that they should avoid doing is discounting or offering up concessions too early in the sales process. Especially here at Gong, we sell to revenue leaders, we sell to sales leaders. Sometimes they're trying to negotiate payment terms on a first call before they've even decided if it's a fit or if it's the right solution for them. Ultimately, what you wanna do is hold on to that pricing integrity for as long as you can throughout the process until they're at the point where they're actually ready to move forward and sign. Why that's so important is if you give up concessions earlier in the process, they don't really feel like concessions. If you're delivering pricing and delivering the discount forty five seconds after you show the pricing sheet, that's that new price moving forward, whatever you discounted, and it's gonna take a lot of credibility away. Ultimately, it'll give you the most wiggle room at the end if you're holding on to that integrity, and then you're able to meet them where they need to be met. Because there's a lot of options outside of just reducing the price, maybe it's working with them on cash flow or reducing it from a three year term to a two year term or negotiating a a case study in there as well. So like anything else, it's really important to run discovery when they're at that point and ready to sign to figure out what's most important to them and then meet them with where they're at. And, hopefully, you're at a point where you still have all all the levers you can pull. Boom. Beautiful. Brian, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? Rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode are, number one, use a what I heard slide to show you listened and as a reason to ask further questions in your second, third, or fourth call. Number two. At the end of your meetings, you should ask your prospect to rate how they feel about what you showed them on a scale of one to 10. That gets you way more detailed information than, oh, how do you feel? You want that quantitative feedback, not necessarily the qualitative. From there, that brings us to takeaway number three, which is if they give you a 10 out of 10, cool. You should be talking about how you can move this thing forward. If it's a seven six or lower, you should be asking, hey. Thanks for sharing that. What would have made this a 10? And bringing us home with number four, every day, look at your full list of opportunities and ask yourself, what could I do today to better my chances with this opportunity? So things like sharing a case study, doing a light touch on LinkedIn, sharing a mini demo video, all things that are no asks for your prospect. Beautiful. Jen, this is normally the part of the show where Arman will ask me how people can help us out, but I'm just gonna ask myself that question. Nick, how can people help us out? And I'm gonna tell you all, if you didn't realize, Jen is not Armond, and you're gonna be seeing and hearing a lot more from her on thirty minutes to presidents club. And Jen is frankly one of the best salespeople that I've ever met. If you've not listened to her her episode where Armand and I interviewed her, she has some really, really great takes on facilitating discussion and disagreement and problem conversations with your prospects. And, Jen, I've learned so much from you over the years. Would you mind sharing with the audience just a little bit about yourself so they can know who they're gonna be getting sales advice from? Sure. Let me just shrink my head back down to a normal size after you hype me up so much. So I spent about eighteen years as an individual contributor in sales. Everything from account management to upsell cross sell to true new logo hunting to big transformative deal selling. I am not someone who considers myself an expert in all things sales. I've just learned a lot over the course of doing it for so dang long. So I spent most of my career at Challenger. If anybody knows the Challenger sale and Challenger customer book, spent some time at Lavender. And now I'm off on my own with my business Demand Gen. So the feelings are mutual, Nick. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to join you. And thank you everybody for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes to Presidents Club.
