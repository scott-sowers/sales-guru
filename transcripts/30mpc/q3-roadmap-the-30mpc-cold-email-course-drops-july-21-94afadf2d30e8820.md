## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this road map episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my host, Nick Sigelski. And, Nick, it is June as of the time it's due. I'm chilly. I'm cold. You know why I'm cold? It's not because I'm in one of those places in the world where the holidays or the seasons are switched. It's not because I ate too many quesadillas, and they're sucking up all the blood in my belly so that the rest of my body shivers. You know why? It's because we're talking about cold emails in June, and there's nothing colder than most people's inboxes when they're sending cold emails today. So before we get into that, Nick, what the heck is a road map episode, and why should people listen? I think the only thing colder than the cold emails, Armand, is the folks listening's reaction to whatever the heck that intro was. But, yes, if you're not familiar with our road map episodes, folks, we do these episodes every single quarter to give you a sense of, like, what the heck to expect from thirty minutes to presidents club over the next ninety days. And in these episodes, we cover three big things. One, we give you a sense of the new products that are coming from thirty minutes to presidents club so you can get your wallets or your credit cards ready. Actually, so you know what we actually have rolling out. But then two, we're gonna give you a sense of the new club hosts, the folks that are gonna be hosting thirty minutes to presidents club, webinars, newsletters, and other pieces of content. And then we also give you a sense of what our content lineup looks like so you can mark your calendar and sign up for the events that actually catch your attention just like the cold emails we're gonna be sending. So let's start with new products. And there is one, and it's a big one. And frankly, folks, when sequences first came out, I had SDRs who were sending automated sequences and semi personalizing emails, and they were booking three, four, or five meetings a week. And now I coach multiple SDR teams where some SDRs are literally sending a thousand emails, and they're not even getting one meeting. Because with AI machine guns sending a million emails between prospects span blocking inboxes getting better and better, it is frankly really hard to succeed in cold email, and the game has fundamentally changed from even two years ago. So we reached out to the person that we personally respect the absolute most when it comes to finding success in outbound, and that person is Jason Bey. If you're not familiar with Jason Bey, he's been a multiple time host on our show. He's been a guest multiple times. He's trained teams at Rippling, Zoom, Gong, and a million other companies. And consistently, he is able to get reps from booking zero one two meetings to three, four, five meetings. On average, he can boost outbound results by 33%, and he has cracked the code on cold email. So that's about as much as I'm gonna give away because we recorded this trailer per usual 3,000 times in studio. So I thought we could just introduce Jason Bay right here alongside us. Let's roll the tape in a three, two, one. There used to be a time where cold email was one of the most reliable ways to book meetings. So prior to even sequences coming out, which I'm old enough to remember actually, we had to manually write emails and I had to click send on each email. It wouldn't even send the follow ups for me. And when sequences came out, I was like, holy shit dude. I could hit the easy button. It's gonna send out as many follow ups as I want to as many people as I want and I'm just booking meetings on repeat. And the fact of the matter is, it's just not like that anymore. So back in the day, you might have booked three, four meetings a week just by clicking go and now you're booking one or two and you're like, shoot maybe if I just four x my email volume, I can go back to the good old days. But inevitably what happens is you sent a a thousand emails, you get blocked by spam, and you still maybe get one to two replies a week. The other end of the spectrum is you research more, you personalize more, and you put more time and care into each individual email that you send. But there is so much noise right now. You can't even guarantee those emails get seen, and you might spend an hour writing four really, really good emails that your buyer doesn't even see in the first place. So what you might be thinking is, does this whole cold email thing even work, or is it worth the amount of time and effort that I'm putting in it? There's the whole in person events thing. There's conferences. The phone has made quite a resurgence. Should I just do that instead? And we actually studied what the top reps do that average reps don't. And one really unique finding that we found is that top reps book eight times more meetings than average reps do via email. So what these top reps do that's quite a bit different from these average reps is, one, everything that they send has this one to one look and feel, but none of them are spending hours doing account research. They're not tailoring and writing the perfect email. They're able to do it in a matter of minutes. The second thing is they think in terms of frameworks instead of template. So they know that their next meeting is not a template away. What they know is that they can apply proven frameworks backed by data that follow a very specific structure that will work across any industry and persona. And lastly, they have a world class offer. What they know is that a demo of their solution, that's not the thing that's gonna compel a buyer, especially c suite executive to take a meeting with them. They're able to put offers that give tangible value around industry insights, what their peers are doing. They give the prospect and buyer a reason to meet with them even if they decided not to purchase their product. So you might be wondering, Jason's too humble to brag about himself, but he's the CEO of Outbound Squad. He has trained over 200 sales teams including the teams over at Gong, Shopify, Zoom, and Rippling. And on average, he is able to get a team to book 20 to 36% more outbound meetings just by working them in a simple step by step program implementing some of the things you just talked about. So can you give me a sense of what you're gonna cover in this course, Jason? Absolutely. So section one, the first thing we're gonna talk about is the art of outbound messaging. So simply what you're gonna get is a framework that literally in less than an hour of work, you can use to upgrade your emails and get more responses, like, later today if you decide to take action on it. Section number two, what we're gonna do is the reply method deconstructed. The reply method is the framework that I've spent over a decade perfecting. We're gonna do a deep dive into everything around personalization. Should you name drop companies? What should you ask for in an email? We're gonna remove the mystery behind all of that. And then section three, what we're gonna do is the ultimate sequence blueprint. So if you've ever wondered, dude, how many emails should I send? Like, in what order? Should I still call? Should I use social, etcetera? We're gonna completely remove the mystery and give you the blueprint around how to drive double digit contact rates. So if you're ready to jump in, in section one, in less than an hour, you are going to learn how to make over your emails, your messaging, your frameworks, your CTAs to literally double the number of replies that you get. So get into it. We're excited to see you there. And in three, two, one. Let's roll. And that tape is a wrap. So folks, if you like what you heard there, there is an incentive for you to join the wait list for the cold email course. Incentive number one, you get a discount, and that will come only during launch week. And then incentive number two is we have released the ultimate cold email data report that breaks down 20 eye popping cold email stats exclusively from the course that Gong helped us find, and you will get access to that report today if you sign up for the wait list. The link is in the show notes, and that is just one part of the outbound bundle that Nick is about to walk you through. So guess what? You get even more free stuff so that you are not as cold as I was at the beginning of this episode. So you've got a proactive discount. You're giving away the report for free, Armand. I can't wait for your negotiation episode to come out because I'm giving you a really really good one. But, actually, folks, that cold email data report answered a lot of questions that I had about cold email that, like, I just there was a lot of advice out there that sounds good in theory. Like, you see these LinkedIn posts, and you're like, yeah. That that sounds good. And then you put it into practice, and it hurts your results more than it helps. And so this data report answered a lot of questions for me around stuff like the impact of personalization based on the different titles of the people that you reach out to. There's some people that different types of personalization work better with versus others. It gave me stuff around, like, email formatting, around the impact of, like, bold, italics, bullet points, etcetera. There were certain words that I didn't realize if you use in your email actually tank your response rate. And so that data report for me at least, like, we've already implemented some of that stuff into our outbound sequences here. It's helped a lot. So the ultimate cold email data report, super valuable. We've got a couple other free pieces of content because Arman sets the pricing on them. Lucky us. We've also put together Jason Bay's sequence template to help you get double digit replies. What Jason has done, he's probably worked with hundreds of different outbound teams, and he put together a couple different best practice sequence templates that go through the number of touches, the number of calls, how you should stack and order those things, how long to wait, when to give up, how to weave social into this stuff. And so if you wanna remove the mystery from what a great sequence or cadence actually looks like, that one is for free also, and it's in the show notes. Cold email also isn't just the first message that you send or a sequence. There's so many other quasi cold emails that we send in sales. Things like when we're going to a conference or when a prospect responds and they say, I'm not interested or when a prospect responds and they say, hey. This isn't my thing, but I've cc'd Arman. You should talk to him. And what Jason has done, he has the luxury of working with all of these high performing teams. He literally compiled 20 of the best email templates that you can use in all of those different situations so you don't have to think of them from scratch. And then the last thing is I've been super skeptical on chat GBT for a very, very long time. And then I actually was there in the studio while we were recording this cold email course with Jason, and, dude, blew me away, Armand. Blew me away, the emails that this thing was spitting out. I thought it was just generic spam cannon stuff. Hell, no. This was way better than what I could write and a lot better than what you would ever write, Armand. But, seriously, Jason has put together all of the prompts that he uses to write world class cold emails in half the time. All of that stuff is for free. It's in the show notes. Go check it out. So to recap, four free things as part of the outbound bundle, the ultimate cold email data report, Jay Bay's sequence template for double digit replies, the get the meeting pack, 20 plus email templates from opening emails to reply emails, and then chat GPT prompts to write cold emails in half the time. Alrighty, folks. So now let's talk about everything else in the world of content. Well, first, you ever watch those shows where it's like diners, drive ins, and dives, and they go to, like, the the barbecue place, and the lady in the back is like, you know, I haven't changed this barbecue basin for forty years, and I swear the sauces have been marinating since 1972. And that's the secret to some great barbecue, but at the same time, sometimes you gotta clean up your barbecue tray a little bit. Alright, folks? And we never wanna change the integrity or the fabric of what made thirty MPC what it is. Fun, structured, hyper tactical content and tactics you can use to get to Presidents Club in under thirty minutes. However, there are certain things that we've heard from you all that you particularly liked in more recent episodes that we plan to double down on. So what you will see over the next coming weeks is our goal is to make 50% of the episodes be host jams and 50% of the episodes be guest interviews. So a guest interview is we go find Johnny Larson, and we interview him on his three tactics and how Johnny Larson made it to president's club because he was the number one rep over at Talkdesk. That's one format. But then the other format is whenever Nick and I do a playbook episode where we break down one topic from beginning to end, those are some of our most popular, most requested episodes. We also did a more recent episode where we broke down the nine hardest lessons we've learned in making over 10,000 cold calls, where we broke down nine different stories that really cemented a lot of learnings that we wrote about in our book, Cold Calling Sucks and That's Why It Works. And the more we've done these, the more people have been like, hey. Will you guys do more host jams, step by step breakdown, story based content? So you guys can expect more of that over the next couple weeks. Every other episode eventually will be a guest interview, and then every other episode in between will be either a q and a or a story style bit or a playbook episode. Yeah. Armond, you and I have the luxury of we get to actually be on these interviews live with every single guest, and I don't think it's realistic for anyone listening to literally listen to every single episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. And so these ones where it's just you and me or you and Mark or we're doing these host jams, I think we're gonna take some of the best of the best learnings from all of these top 1% performers, and we'll put it together in a really, really structured, snackable way so folks can rip through it and take the best from the other episodes. So I'm really excited for some of these new formats. And so that brings us to our next section, which is our newest club host. Again, club hosts at thirty minutes to presidents club are the best of the best sellers. The people that, honestly, you and me, Arman, when we meet them, we're like, wow. I have a lot to learn from this person when it comes to sales. And this person, when I met them about six months ago, they honestly were not the world's most tenured salesperson. They were a former teacher. And I met them. We had a couple conversations about selling, and I instantly was like, this person has an extremely high ceiling. And we had one or two conversations where, like, I shared a couple tactics that I've learned from our past guests. And this guy went and immediately implemented it in the field and came back and was like, dude, that worked. I want more. And we ended up hiring this person. This person is Alex Murphy, who is our founding account executive here at thirty minutes to presidents club. And not only is he somebody who, when he learns something, immediately implements it, he's getting really good really, really fast. Alex just hit 223% of his quota for the month of June, and I'm recording this on June 17. So he still has some room to go. He's someone that, frankly, I've started to learn stuff about sales from because he and I are tag teaming deals together. He is going to be leading one of our cold calling webinars upcoming in this quarter. And so, Alex Murphy, welcome to the thirty MPC club as a club host. We're really, really happy to have you on the thirty MPC sales team, but also now as an official club host. And, folks, Alex, in the last ten days, has closed a 150 k of revenue, a 100 k deal and a 50 k deal, which is absolutely nuts. And so if you want to be like Alex, one last small announcement here is that we are hiring for three roles at thirty minutes to presidents club. So one, we're hiring an AE who's going to sell courses to sales teams. In other words, sell the entire discovery course package to a team that's trying to get better at discovery, and then next week help them build their pipeline by selling the cold calling course. So that role is gonna come in at a 120 k OTE. The next role is we're hiring Alex number two to sell our biggest brand sponsorships to sales tech companies that comes in at a 150 OTE, and you'll sell to awesome companies like Gong, Outreach, and more. And then lastly, if you are a seller who has ever considered becoming a marketer, someone like a Devin Reed, for example, who famously built Gong's marketing brand and was an AE before. Well, guess what? I am hiring our first ever content marketer, content strategist, and I'm specifically looking for a seller who wants to become a marketer. The way Nick and I learned how to become marketers is we wrote one LinkedIn post at a time, and I wanna teach you the exact same thing. And so if you ever thought about taking more of a creative angle to your career and being less about closing deals yourself and more about teaching other people to close deals, you're in the right place. So if you want to work with thirty minutes to president's club, and if you are in LA or New York because the magic of getting to president's club happens in person, There are three job descriptions down in the show notes below, and you can apply to each of those there. Or you can just send us direct emails at Nick@30mpc.com or Armond@30mpc.com, telling us why you should sell or market for 30. Seriously, we're we're really excited to get to meet some of you. I'm pumped to grow our our sales team, and and, Armand, I'll personally say this. I've gotten to work with you now for, believe it or not, almost a decade, I think, in a couple different ventures, thirty MPC being the most notable one. And I've learned so much from you. I you have really, really accelerated my career and my learnings. And so whoever gets that marketing role and gets to work literally in lockstep with you is one lucky person. And I am so glad someone else will be fixing my typos, not you, because I'm sure they'll be a bit less acidic when I get a Google Docs comment from them than from you. But, half kidding. Fully kidding. Anyways, that brings us to our last piece, which is our q three content lineup. We've got some awesome stuff in the works. So in July, we have our big cold email clinic, which is gonna be led by Jason Bay. He's gonna be going through all of the data that is in that ultimate Gong 30 MPC cold email data report. So if you want answers to things like the impact of personalization when you're reaching out to a manager versus a VP, that's gonna get answered for you. If you wanna know how long the perfect cold email should be, both from a word count perspective, a number of paragraphs perspective, how it should be formatted perspective, what your subject line should and shouldn't look like perspective, if you wanna know banned words, if you wanna know what your CTA should be, all of the stuff is going to get answered. We got, I think it was, like, 40 plus data points, Armand, around what makes a world class cold email. So that's gonna be in July with Jason Bay. So in August, we have Jen Ellen, David Rosenstein, who is in the top 1% club at LinkedIn, and McKenna Turner, who is a salesperson, Arman, that you have personally coached for the past couple years. And we're going to be doing a live tape tear down of one of McKenna's sales calls that actually was a one call close. And so if you wanna learn how to take control of a sales call, how to ask questions that uncover massive problems, and how to magnify urgency to close on the call, this is one that you should be signing up for. In September, we've got our leadership live tactic teardown where Jason Bey again and Ken Amar are gonna be taking us through the cold call operating system for sales leaders. And so this is one you should sign up for if you wanna learn how to smash call reluctance with your team, if you wanna learn how to build a cold calling framework so your reps know exactly what to say no matter what situation they run into, And if you wanna learn how to coach your team so that they leave every coaching session better and better and better, that's one to sign up for. And then in September, we're gonna be doing a cold call teardown. And so if you want to see some examples of great cold calls, including one from Alex Murphy, reviewed, coached, torn down, we are going to be myself and Alex going through a number of call recordings and giving feedback on everything from the opener to the tonality to how those folks navigate objections. And so I'm personally very excited for this one because we're gonna cover stuff like how to bypass those knee jerk reactions that prospects often have. We're going to teach how you can turn resistance. I'm not interested into actual meetings, and so this will be a very, very good one, Armand. So, folks, if you think your prospects sound like that, then you definitely need to listen to these tactic tear downs. So to recap, folks, you can get on the wait list for the cold email course and get the ultimate email data report. Just go to 30mbc.com backslash courses. Check out more about the course, or you can go to the outbound bundle, which gives you the sequence template, the data report, the cold email templates, plus the chat GPD prompts.

And then lastly, go sign up for all the tactic tear downs.
