## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. I'm your host, Nick Sigelski, joined with my co host, Jen Allen Knuth. And today, we've got Caitlin Zylstra who is an enterprise AE over at Deal. Jen, why should people listen? We've all lost those deals where we have a great champion who all of a sudden falls apart at the finish line. So Caitlin does an amazing job teaching us how we work with our champions, how we work with these larger buying groups to make sure we see the deal through all the way to the finish line. And a three, a two, a one, don't let this episode fall apart, and don't let your deals fall apart because Caitlyn was so kindhearted and generous where she actually put together a template for free of the exact internal prep doc that she talks about in this episode. So if you wanna steal the way that Caitlin is prepping her execs and SMEs when she brings them into a deal, there's a link in the show notes. Go get it. It's free, and check it out and enjoy this episode. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Caitlin. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Thanks, Nick. So number one, going beyond the basics to build a strong POV before your first meeting, critically important. So the three ways that I do this is meeting with previous users, meeting with a non competitive sales team that's been working with the account or has an open opportunity with the account. And then my personal favorite is actually reaching out to a top performing end user to pick their brain on how to break into the account and meet with the right individuals. Boom. Beautiful. What's number two? Number two. So to ensure that your external meetings are a success, my number one takeaway is that internal preparation is just as important as external preparation. And one of my biggest things that I love to do is creating a framework on how to run external meetings efficiently by giving the internal cross functional teams that you're gonna be pulling into these meetings critical things that they need to stick to. One of those would be having them understand what the business challenges are for a prospect, what executive priority does it tie back to, what is the cost if they don't do or move forward with your solution. And then the two biggest take aways are what does success look like for that specific meeting? And what role do you want that cross functional partner or executive team to play in that meeting? Beautiful. Round us out. What's number three? Number three is always a personal favorite. It's how do you pressure test your champion throughout a sales cycle to make them earn the right of the title of being your champion? The best way that I've learned how to do this is actually within my past failures. So one of the biggest key takeaways I have is laying out what a successful evaluation looks like, and then having them show me the gaps of what some of my false assumptions might be, and say, here's what it's gonna look like internally for us to mirror what your successful evaluation path looks like, And how do we mutually quarterback this together internally and externally to make it a success? Oh, I am gonna have to steal that one, and I'm gonna have so much success with it because I've got a lot of failures, Caitlin. Let me tell you. I wanna start with one of the failures that I've had that sort of relates to your tip about when you're bringing on other colleagues of yours to help with a sale, whether that's an executive, a subject matter expert, etcetera. I think back to a deal I was working once where I involved my CEO in the deal, and I had him come talk to the managing partner of this law firm that I was selling to because the managing partner had heard some rumblings that our customer support had gone downhill, and the CEO had literally just rolled out a strategic plan to improve those things. And I was like, awesome. CEO can explain this great turnaround that's happening and what it means for this guy and develop a relationship. And we went into the meeting, and the CEO talked about basically the opposite of what I wanted him to share with the customer. And I'm sitting here just pouring sweat in that meeting thinking this ain't good. We didn't end up moving forward with that deal. I want to ask you about some of the specifics about, like, what does it actually sound like when you're saying, hey. This is what success sounds like, or this is what the hesitations the buyer has. Because I wanna get really, really crispy in terms of, like, what it sounds like that you're sharing with your execs and other stakeholders. Absolutely. So while I'm meeting with them internally, I've put together a framework of kind of these $4 of what they need to understand before they go and walk into this meeting with an executive. It's so easy for executives or any member of your cross functional team to basically give their perspective on how to use their solution because they're using their solution every day. So for example, I would sell a tool that helps with pipeline visibility and forecast accuracy. Well, the way my executive is gonna leverage our own internal tool mirrors what their own KPIs and what their own revenue model is for their company in the first place. Versus if I were gonna meet with another company who's maybe tracking things on a monthly basis versus a quarterly or annual basis, their talk track's not gonna resonate with this company because they're not mirroring their workflows when it comes to assessing their pipeline, assessing their forecast reviews. So a mistake I've made in the past is said, hey, you know, mister and missus CRO, let's come in. You're gonna be meeting the CRO of x company, leverage, and explain to them how you leverage the tool every day to make it so that you're really good at your own job. And the problem was is they were using their own language, their own lingo, and their own workflows that had nothing to do with how the company was running their business. And so what I now do is I say when I'm going to an internal an executive and I'm preparing them for the meeting, I say things like success for this meeting is going to be that the CRO walks away with not only understanding how our solution is gonna give them better insights into their pipeline management and better forecast accuracy, but they're gonna walk away with knowing exactly how they're gonna do that for the specific needs and challenges of their business. That's so smart. I wanna highlight the little nuance that you did there. You talked about how you'll pull in your CRO to show, hey. Here's how I look at my pipeline and predict where the business is going from a forecasting perspective. And if your CRO is looking at that on a quarterly basis, but your prospect looks at stuff on a monthly, weekly, daily basis, they're going to get confused. And it is your responsibility. It's our responsibility as salespeople to speak the language that our customer understands and translate the way that we think about things into words that the customer understands because then they understand so much faster. And most sales meetings, in my opinion, fail because of indigestion. Folks don't understand what you're sharing versus starvation. You're not sharing enough. I have another example about that. I think one of the biggest mistakes that I find that sales individuals are doing is they have this fear that they are no longer running their cycle or their opportunity when an executive gets pulled in. Mistake number one. Like, you are the quarterback of your opportunity of the account for a reason. You are the CEO of your business and the opportunity. You are leveraging your executives because they are a resource to help you get the deal across the finish line. People forget that your executive isn't in the 50 to 60 meetings that you've been having with your champion or that other executive or VP off the bat. And so there's this fear that they have to take this back seat and let their executive run the whole meeting. And that's when sometimes, unfortunately, executives take it down a rabbit hole. So one of the biggest things someone has taught me and what I found super successful is giving that individual a specific role and saying your role in this meeting is to provide the perspective of the CRO, but from a monthly standpoint, not the one that you're used to, which is a quarterly standpoint. And tell them things that they shouldn't be doing. Hey. It's going to fail if you go start talking about some new product we're about to roll out in four quarters from now. It's not gonna help the situation. So it's the perfect lead in to my question, which was, you know, the best laid plans can still go awry. Right? So let's say you've got a call where you've planned with your executive, but let's say they're a founder, they're in love with their product, and they start going down a rabbit hole, and you can sense the body language from the prospect like, hey. This is not what they're looking to hear. How do you tow that line of still being respectful to your executive partner, but also making sure to your point that you're taking control of the conversation because you are the one that has it. So what do you do in those situations to kind of rein back control? One of the biggest things is I always try and lead with transparency. Remember, your executives hired you for a reason. They know that you're running the deal the way that you wanna run the deal, and they don't wanna derail or or make it a failure. So I always set the expectation with the CEO. Let's say it's the CEO I'm bringing in or the CRO. And I say, hey. There is a time and place for us to talk about where we're taking the company in the future, right, or what we've been doing across x amount of our customers. But we only have this might be our only opportunity to have thirty minutes with this individual throughout this entire sales cycle. And so I really wanna ensure that we hit on these three critical things that are gonna be make it and break it for them specifically So how I just do it is ensuring just saying, you know, there's a time and a place. If it gets to an example or a scenario where the CEO wants to spend additional time with you and talk about a product road map, great. But for this specific meeting, success is going to equal x, y, and z. Caitlin, when we were talking on the prep for this episode, you had this wonderful prep document that I I hope maybe we can share with the audience. We'll have to talk about that. You had some stuff on there like, yes. You had what success looks like. You had details about, hey. Here's what the customer's tech stack looked like. You had other stuff like, hey. Here's hesitations that the buyer might have about moving forward. I'm wondering if you can give sort of the quick punch list of the things that you include on there. You don't have to go in super deep detail. I'm just curious if folks wanted to, like, build their own some of those key things that you put on there. Absolutely. I think one of the biggest things right now, especially given the market, is whoever your final buying committee might be or the executive buyer who's gonna be signing off on this at the end. What I have always found is that the number one thing that they care about is how do I ensure that my solution is not going to become shelfware. Right? They want to ensure that you have a thirty, sixty, ninety day plan on rolling out your solution in effective manner so that you're driving a 100% adoption right off the bat. They don't want to do what they've probably done in the past was buy two or three different solutions. No one's gonna own those internally, and then the individuals at the company are just never gonna leverage them. So one of the biggest things I feel like individuals have been almost leaving out or not leaning into throughout an initial sales cycle is what are those apprehensions that your buying committee or your CFO or CEO is going to wanna take into consideration when weighing whether or not this is the right decision to make the purchase or not. And a big one of that is kind of the whole post sales side of the process, which is like, okay. What happens when we do become a partner? So I always wanna ensure that one of the biggest apprehensions is that. Like, what happens once we become partners, and what does it look like that you're gonna ensure that we have a successful deployment and people are gonna actually leverage this tool on a day to day basis? So one of the things that you've referenced a couple times and a place where I really, really admire your thinking is around how you manage champions. I'm gonna ask you, like, a really straightforward, potentially stupid question, but how do you know you even have a champion? Like, how do you know this is the right person to lean all the way forward into when you're working a deal at the size and and scope of yours? What I like to do is I like to ask the champion themselves, why do we need to ensure that this evaluation is successful? We need to ensure that this evaluation is successful, most likely because there's obviously an executive priority that you're tying this evaluation to. And if the company gets that wrong, there's obviously repercussions. They're gonna be living in their existing pain. They're gonna lose revenue because they're not fixing the problem. But for the champion specifically, I wanna ensure that they are a champion by saying, how do I make your job easier as a champion? And what happens if you don't get this process right? Yeah. And unfortunately, I mean, I don't know if you wanna share this, but unfortunately, sometimes their job is on the line. They've been hired because they want to perfect a system or some sort of blocker that they have that's been a go to market inefficiency. So they're getting hired to spearhead this initiative to ensure that it's successful. And I pressure test my champion by saying, how are you gonna derisk any blocker that comes into this or any concern that's brought to the table so that you're an expert on how this evaluation is gonna run. And and I'm an expert in partnering with you to make sure that that you get it right. Because at the end of the day, you don't want some someone coming to them back to them in six months from now saying, why did we buy this tool? Caitlin, when in the sales process are you, like, starting to ask questions and pressure test your champion? Because I have to imagine if Jen is a prospect of mine and she shows up on a discovery call and I'm like, hey, Jen. It's nice to meet you. Boom. Boom. Boom. She's gonna be like, woah, Nick. What does your product even do? So, like, at what point do you go from discovery about the situation, challenges, etcetera, to pushing your champion? That's a great question. And one of the things is there's a fine balance between leveraging your past failures and your past experience and everything that you've happened and getting to the point where you don't wanna feel like you're telling your champion what to do, or you're almost coming off like they don't know what they're doing. Right? So I always wanna position it as my goal. My number one goal is to make your job easier and co quarterback this whole thing from start to finish. And how I'm aligning that is obviously in a discovery call. Obviously, in the first one or two meetings, you're gonna wanna pressure test your champion and say, is there really a problem, a true challenge and a true need that your company is trying to solve for? You're gonna align on what that challenge and that problem might be. Then you'll get to a point where you've established that there's problem. You've established that there's a true initiative, and now you wanna walk your champion through how are we gonna make this successful. And so I'm probably doing it at the end of a first call or maybe even the second call, where I've said, okay. We've aligned on the pain. We've aligned on the challenges. Now let's carve out an additional meeting, just the two of us, where we're kinda gonna be removing what the pain and the challenges are and really talking about the process itself. And I'll devote an entire meeting to just that. How do you sell that meeting to the buyer? Is there any time that they're like, wait. What? I'm confused. Like, I'm curious how you voice that over in a meeting. So I would specifically tell them one of the best ways in order to ensure that we are being the right partners with each other to make this successful is I find it very valuable for you and I to actually carve out an additional thirty minutes to just talk about what the process might look like, identify any gaps, and then really map out what we're gonna need from one another and how we're gonna hold each other accountable to ensure that this process is successful. I just ask. Full transparency. Love the transparency. Okay. So let me ask you another what if scenario question because I just love picking your brain on this stuff. So what if you have a deal that you think, hey. I've seen deals like this before. You prescribe what you believe to the champion is the right course of action, and they push back and kind of stonewall us and say, Caitlin, thanks. I appreciate that, but let me just take this back to my team. And it's early, and you know that is like the kiss of death. What's your talk track for handling that? What do you do in those situations, and and why do you do it that way? So, again, this is another great opportunity to press or test your champion. I like to ask the reasons behind why they're going back to those individuals to ask those specific questions. And the the easiest way to do it is just by asking, like, can you walk me through what that type of meeting is going to look like? What types of questions are you gonna take back to your internal team? Since we have ten minutes left in this call, can we actually iron out or maybe discuss some of the apprehensions you have or some of those questions that you think your team is gonna come back to you with so that we can get ahead of them? You can tell that there's people who, like, they need to digest everything that you've just told them. Right. Here's how the evaluation is gonna go. This is what the pain's gonna look like. Maybe they didn't even understand that they had all this pain in the first place, or they didn't understand they were gonna have to bring in x, y, and z individuals throughout this process. So it's just like a block to absorb. So I try and always just say, that's great. I find it most valuable when we can discuss what some of those pushbacks or some of those questions will be upfront. Because my goal is to arm you with a response of when some of those blockers or when some of those challenges come up in the meeting that you're gonna have. I love that. I think that is such a nuanced and smart way of saying, let me prepare you for the questions you probably are not anticipating so that when those questions come up, even though you're not in the room, they're thinking about how you've wired them to answer or respond to those questions. Super smart. And I do that by sharing. That's when I would then share examples of something that's come up in the past. What's really smart about this is I usually, to your point, take what the buyer says at face value. Okay. They're gonna share this information back with their team, and then I end up sending a PDF with details, and I send them a little video. And I'm like, you're making me realize that stuff probably isn't getting shared in the meeting. It might be, but you're asking about, like, the format of the taking it back to the team. Is it a Slack message they're gonna send to somebody? Is it that they have a weekly team meeting and this will be one of the items on the agenda? Like, how much time are they gonna talk about it? And when you look to the future or make the buyer look to the future with those things, they're like, wait. Oh, I know we're gonna get asked about this. And then you can coach them on how to sell. But wondering I share, like, videos and PDFs and stuff, and I'm wondering about the format of content that you share and the types of content that you share in deal cycle to empower your champion to help navigate selling on your behalf, basically. Absolutely. For me, the biggest thing of arming a champion with the types of materials that are gonna help them is sharing some sort of playbook. So there's probably been a playbook for success that maybe your internal enablement team has put together or your professional services team has put together or sales engineering team has put together that has been successful on how to roll out an efficient evaluation. So there's a couple of things that I will always leverage of tools, and that is what is the success criteria playbook look like? The number one thing I'm trying to get from a company that I'm working with is obviously what's your current state challenges and what's your current state workflow. And then what is your future state look like for your company? Define what success is gonna look like based on the gaps that you're experiencing today. And then I will actually leverage a success criteria playbook, which is just basically a Blake template of, hey. If you've never done this before and your company has never actually sat and said, how are we gonna build out what our success criteria looks like? It is truly just a a standard template that just says, here are the three main things that our company is experiencing challenge. It's a domino effect. These challenges then affect x, y, and z individuals. What does success look like in all of these different departments to ensure that we're doing things more efficiently? So I use a lot of success criteria playbooks. I use a lot of mutual action plans by way of working backwards on what an ideal go live state would be. And then I put some assumptions in, hey, we have to run these types of meetings throughout the sales cycle, and that's what I'm leveraging to kinda keep them accountable. So you've sold into mid market. You spent years selling into enterprise. Obviously, when you move into enterprise, one of the big challenges for those that haven't sold into it is just the number of people that get involved. Maybe not directly, but indirectly behind the scenes just grows and grows and grows. So one of the things you talked about on the preshow was the importance of working with your champion to ride shotgun with you the whole way through. Can you say a little bit more about why that's important and then how you do that in places maybe you've in the past thought, hey, I can ride solo on this one and then learned, you know, alternatively? What I've come up against in large strategic enterprise cycles is that, again, you're probably meeting with anywhere from 40 to 60 individuals. Personal experience, I I met with 80 individuals within a company in order to run a successful evaluation. And what I have found that all different parts of the business that are gonna be a part of this decision making or this executive buyer committee is I find that a lot of these teams internally are running siloed systems or processes in order to actually go through their own internal evaluation. And so my job with my champion is to prepare with every single group that we are meeting with to walk through the scenarios of what happens if we walk into this meeting and you've got individuals who don't agree on this in this certain type of solution. What if there's gonna be a roadblock that comes up? How are we gonna handle those objections? How are we gonna ensure that we've been working with x, y, and z team? So my goal is to make sure that my champion is a part of every single conversation that I am having with however many people are a part of this buying committee. Because the best way to do that is your champion knows what the number one thing is that you're trying to solve for with that company. And so when you repeat what that challenge is or that pain is, and you hone in on like the essence of why you're even having this evaluation in the first place, every time you meet with a different part of the buying committee or a different facet of the company, that's going to be a part of this decision making process. That's critical specifically for large buying committees. The mistake I've made in the past was you work so hard in the first, you know, six to nine months, ensuring that there's the right challenge that you're solving for Consensus driven decisions where you're meeting with every type of a buyer or user or decision maker that's going to be a part of this. And then you get to procurement or you get to the final meeting with the CIO who is basically responsible for allocating resources to actually get this thing up and running. And then you don't have your champion in the room with you. And that's where you can make or break a deal because those individuals procurement or IT resources have no idea about any of the work that you've been doing for six to nine months. So when I say I wanna ensure that, like, a champion is actually co quarterbacking this entire thing is, I am basically demanding or making their request that that individual and my champion is in every single one of those internal meetings. I love that. And then last question before we move to final question, how would you position that to your champion? So let's say someone thinks like, oh, okay. I've done all the front stuff. Now Caitlin, you take it from here. How do you actually articulate it? Like like, I find the the customer prospect. So what I would say to my champion is this. I wanna ensure that all of the work that you and I have done together and all of the cross functional teams doesn't go to waste in the past six to nine months. It would suck, right, if you've done all this work and then your champion goes into a meeting, they're not well prepared, and then all of that work for the six to nine months goes out the window. So I would say to the champion, I have found that the most successful way to drive this thing to a finish line is to ensure that you are a part of all of these internal conversations moving forward. And the reason for that being is I really wanna hone in on the essence of why you're driving this evaluation in the first place and ensure that these individuals, like procurement, like IT, understand that you've done all the critical work alongside our company to make sure that we're gonna have a successful partnership. Boom. Beautiful. This has been a phenomenal interview, Caitlin, but we are running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question. The final question is this. We have talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? In this market, I definitely feel like the number one thing that individuals aren't doing and should be leaning in on is asking for referrals and for feedback. A huge part of success in sales and building out trust and building out referrals is just asking your champion or the company that is now hopefully a client, what their experience was working with you. It's just gonna make you a better seller. So throughout a cycle, you're gonna need folks that are gonna be references for you. And so I have a pretty simple template that I've put together after I've run a successful deployment. Another major tip, if you wanna take it even a step further, is if you're leveraging a reference during a sales cycle, make sure that you are sending them a thank you note for being part of your reference and also letting them know what happens to the actual prospect. So many times, I have gone back to someone who's been a reference for me, and I've said, hey. Just so you know, that conversation was really fruitful. It was a huge part of why they wanted to move forward with us. They've now become a customer. And that other customer reference has been like, wow. Thanks for letting me know. People actually, like I always wondered, like, what the heck happens to these people? And so an easy framework that I've put together an email template or an ask that I've said when it comes to gathering feedback or gathering a reference has been really simple. It's basically, hey, customer. Thanks for being an incredible partner throughout this evaluation. Super grateful to welcome you into the deal family. Look forward to ensuring that you're gonna be successful your entire life cycle with us. As part of the process, I really care about just becoming a better seller. And the best way to do that is asking for feedback, asking for you to be a reference if you're open to that. And then do you have any referrals within your own network that you think would benefit from a conversation with us? Beautiful. Well, I benefited from this conversation with you, Caitlin.

Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode with Caitlin Zylstra. Number one, you need to explain things in your customer's language. If your customer looks at data on a monthly basis and your SME normally looks at data on a quarterly basis, it is on you to make sure that your SME adapts the demo or whatever they share to how the customer thinks about things. Your job is to translate for them. Number two, involve your champion in every single customer touch point because they will help share context and help be your co quarterback for the deal. Number three, ask your buyer to correct you. When you get to the point of the sale where you're walking through next steps for evaluation, be okay with being corrected. Literally say it out loud. Correct me where I'm wrong here. And number four, when you are inviting an internal call partner to join your meeting, go beyond the basics. Ask questions like, what are the business challenges for the prospect? What executive priority does it tie to? What's the cost of an action? What does success look like? And what role do you want them to play? Nick, how can listeners help us out today? Well, you can help yourself out by helping yourself out, and that will help us out. And what I mean by that is please go steal the exec prep document that Caitlin put together for you for free. It's free. It's fun, and it'll help you sell more deals. Thanks for listening. It's in the show notes. We'll see you next week on the show.
