## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. I'm your host, Nick Sigelski, and I'm joined with my co host, Jen Allen Knuth. And today, we have Jeb Blunt back on the show for a round two. He's someone that's been foundational to me when I was learning how to sell. Jen, why should people listen? So some of us have grown up in a post COVID sales world where little to none of our sales activity is in person. The famous Jeb shares some excellent tactics for how we can make the most of in person meetings and when and how and why to use them. And three, two, one. Get on an airplane. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Alright, Jeb. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Yeah. Number one is talk to people. Are they if you if you think about where we are in the world right now, talking with people is the most impactful thing you can do. And so many salespeople have go gone asynchronous, asynchronous, so we're just sending emails to people or we're sending direct messages, and we're using AI to do a lot of those conversations. So the most important thing and impactful thing you can do is talk with people. Number two is just because AI can do something doesn't mean that it should. There's a whole lot of tools out there we need to be aware of that are really tech solutions looking for a problem. So you wanna be very careful with that. I got a bunch of, things in my kitchen that were exactly the same thing. I got a, for example, an avocado opener that, you know, that cost, I don't know, $10, but you can do it with a knife faster than that thing. And the and the last thing is communication blending. What we have to understand is that there are lots of ways we could communicate with people today. Use the communication channel and the communication method that's gonna give you the highest probability of gaining your desired outcome at the lowest cost of time, energy, and money, and you gotta think about it that way. So it's all about the probability of gaining the outcome based on the communication channel versus what so many salespeople do today. Back to my number one tip is they just pick the channel that they're most comfortable with versus the channel that's gonna give them the highest probability of winning. I should be doing also math exercise of thinking about, like, the amount of time I invest versus the amount of synchronous communication that I learn from the customer and they learn what's inside my head. What channels should I be opting for? If you think about it, the best way for us to communicate, the most effective way to communicate is in face to face. This year, in particular, because of the snapback from COVID, I'm a 100% close rate on every deal, every situation where I've been face to face. A 100%. Now that's not the most efficient way to close deals in my business because I work with people all over the world. So in a lot of cases, we wanna go to video. Video works because I can see you. Jen said, man, I love your setup. I said, I got five setups. Like, in this particular office, my salespeople are set up this way as well because we wanna come off and look professional, and we wanna use good cameras, and we wanna give you the closest facsimile of being in person. Beyond that would be a synchronous conversation by phone. We've been selling on the phone for, you know, for a century. So we can we can pick up the phone. We can call people, have a synchronous conversation. Beyond that, a synchronous conversation might be text messaging. I mean, these days with customers, especially when you got a relationship, there's some customers that you work with on a regular basis and they need to buy something fast. You can get the entire deal done on a text message. It's not abnormal to negotiate via text message. I can send you something overnight, and then you get back with me, and then we talk to each other texting. And then I can very quickly move that either to a voice conversation or a video conversation just in a moment. The problem for so many salespeople, we think about ourselves. What makes us comfortable? And this is a real problem right now because people are abusing email at a level that I've never seen before to the point where every executive I talk to says I'm turning it off. I will not accept an email from a salesperson. I'm done with it. If you talk to top salespeople, they tell you that right now, face to face is working very, very well. So even hybrid teams are getting back out into the field. It won't be like that forever. We'll have another pendulum swing back the other way. But my point is is that you've gotta do good enough discovery, have built deep enough relationship, have enough awareness to think that in this moment, what should I do? Yes. I could fire off a quick text message, but is that the right move on the chessboard at this moment? That's what human nuance is. Like, that's that's our ability to think and be creative. So I wanna ask you a question about when the customer suggests a communication channel that you know in your heart isn't right for the type of information exchange that needs to happen. So I'm gonna give you a real scenario. Yesterday, I met with there's a company I'm working to sell to right now, and I met with cofounder number one of this company. And we went through a proposal. He's like, this looks great. I feel on board. We need to get consensus from my cofounder. Let's schedule a meeting with that person for Friday and go through the same proposal. I said, awesome. So I send the calendar invite. I put a little agenda in the invite of, hey. Here's context for what's going on. This is what we're gonna do in this meeting. This is why we're here. I get a response from cofounder two earlier today, and he says, hey, Nick. Thanks for your email. Thanks for your note. Things have been really busy, and I'm really trying to guard my calendar. I looked at your website last night. Can you send me a short note to help me understand your reach, audience, and range of pricing so I know what we're talking about? Okay. Got it. So so in this situation, you have to make a call. And I you know, you have to make a call based on first the veracity of the first partner, the first cofounder's motivation to do business with you. And I wrote about this just real quickly. I wrote about this in Inked, a book I wrote on sales closing and negotiation. It's something called MLP strategy. Right? So that is motivation, leverage, and power. So in this moment, in in their situation, they have multiple options or multiple alternatives. The the party that has more alternatives has more power. So that's why you're like, I don't know what what do I do in this situation because you realize that you're in a tenuous situation with them from a from a standpoint of other options where they could spend their money. The first partner is super motivated to do business with you because they met you. And anybody that meets Nick, man, I wanna do business with you. Like, I mean, you're just, like, that good. Like, the the that reason I'm back here is because I fell in love with you the last time you interviewed me. I'm like, I love this dude. So you've got that piece, and you were able to make that connection with him, and you know that's your gift. That's why you went and met with him in person or, you know, at least face to face. So this other partner is saying, hey. You know what? I'm not gonna talk to you from a motivation standpoint. I'm gonna hold all of my alternatives over here, and you're like, what do I do? So your leverage is the other partner's motivation, and it's the information that you have. Does it make sense? So the question you have to ask yourself is based on that response, is this guy for real? Like, is this something where it would make sense for me to give him a quick executive summary and then ask for the meeting? Mhmm. Or should you maybe loop back with the other partner and say, hey. I got a response from your, you know, your partner, your your your other cofounder. It seems like this person's not as interested in this as you. Could you shed some light on that? And that way, at least you can get some flavor. Because the other the other partner maybe say, no. No. No. They're totally built built bought in, but this is just the way he does the world. He's just gonna look at it, get it right. I've already explained it to him. We're ready to go. So especially if you've already given him a proposal. Now if you haven't given a proposal yet, now you need to hold on to that and say to the other guy, let's all get together in at one time so I can give you both a proposal at the same time. And you use that leverage to force them to dance to your tune because they want your numbers. Like, they they're interested enough to meet with you. They want your numbers. Those are the I mean, that's the sales chessboard. Like, that's what you have to be thinking about all the time. And in your shoes, like, on the surface, like, as you read the the note to me, I go, I don't know. You know, if you've got a good relationship with them and you've got a good value proposition and they need you, you might say to the you might send to the other partner, here's the executive summary of what we do, holding back maybe some information that they might want. On the flip side of that, what I would probably do in this situation is if I had a really good meeting with the with the cofounder that I felt good about, like, walking away from. And I felt like there's a relationship there where we can talk to each other from a transparent standpoint. So he says, he gives you the buying sign. I'm ready to move forward. We need to socialize this with everybody else. You've been sales long long enough to know that that that could be a death sentence if you don't get it socialized the right way. Mhmm. I would probably loop back to that person with a phone call and just say, hey. As I tried to get on your your your, cofounder's, schedule. He says he's super, really busy. He doesn't really have time to meet with me. Could you help me out just a little bit here? Because I really wanna do business with you, and I don't want this to get vetoed at that place if I do this the wrong way. And then just shut up and let the guy talk, and he may tell you, hey, Nick. You're worried about the wrong thing. Just send it to him. At that point, what are you gonna do? The other thing that you could do is say, I totally get where you're coming from, but an executive summary of all these things probably won't give you everything you deserve. Why don't we find a time that's more convenient for you and offer some additional times? Then what you're doing at that point is testing that person's engagement. So you what you wanna do is see, are they willing to step forward and match your effort with something? So I would do I would and you might do those two things in a combination. Loop back with your partner, the other cofounder, the one you have a relationship with, see if you can get some insight, and then test this with the other guy saying, listen. There's I really wanna spend time with you because I need to I need to give you the time you just deserve. Why don't we find a time that's more convenient for you? And then see what happens. Because there I don't think that either one of those moves is gonna is gonna get you kicked out of the deal. Yeah. I mean, you're right. I think the right next action is I have a good relationship with cofounder a. I should call that person because regardless of whether what approach I take, the suggesting other times, the sending executive summary, the other cofounder is gonna help me understand this other person's style, which will inform how I respond to that email. And I think there's another option where, actually, cofounder a is like, let me call him. Let me get let me get let me get with my cofounder. I need to explain to him why he needs to take this meeting. So going back to what you said about the value of in person meetings, but the trade off of the time investment that you're putting in, can you break down for a listener who's maybe saying, look. I've got five, six people I know are involved in the deal. What is the decision criteria you use to evaluate? Does it warrant going in person, or or should does it make more sense to to do it virtually? Well, number one, be the size of the deal. Right? So so what is the size of the deal, and what's the impact on my firm? So 1,300 people, the size of that deal is massive, and the impact on my firm is huge. So for, you know, for a training company, that's a monster deal. So first of all, I'm a look at what's the size of the deal. The other is proximity. Like, where are they in proximity to me? So getting on an airplane clearly is super inefficient in terms of time and relatively expensive, especially if you're going to Manhattan. If it's a big deal and they're close to me, I'm always gonna go in person because the cost is relatively low, and and it and it absolutely lowers the risk that I lose the deal. If I'm having a conversation with someone and I'm in, you know, The United States, I'm in Georgia, and they're in, say, Mumbai, India, we're probably gonna do that on video unless it say you want, you know, 7 figure deal. Like, you know, if I'm in I'm in a deal where it's much bigger than I'd probably go there. And I wouldn't do it necessarily at the very beginning. I would do it toward the end. So then I'm looking at where am I in the sales process. So if I'm gonna invest my time in person, I I would prefer to invest my time in person during the discovery process versus either the first time appointment, so getting to know them, or in the presentation process. Now sometimes it makes sense to do a final presentation if you have a large stakeholder group, and I have been there and done this where there are executives involved, and I haven't been able to meet everyone. And I've got a coach or someone who says, look. You need to come and do this, and I will do that. And then when I do that, I've mapped everybody exactly what Nick says. I'm meeting with the my coach in advance. I know everybody's gonna be in the room, all their tails, who they are, how their what their communication style is. I've done my research. I've got a war board. I've I know their picture. I know where they went to college. I know their pet's name. So I'm using all of those things, Jen, to make a decision about whether I should be there. The final piece I use is just my intuition. Like, I'm I'm paying attention to, in this situation, how where do I feel like from a probability standpoint I am in closing the deal? In other words, do I feel that they're into me? Are they motivated? Are they matching my effort? Are they engaged? For example, in Nick's case, I call up our the first, you know, cofounder, and the cofounder says, man, we are totally into this. This deal's gonna happen. We've gotta get in front of my, my other cofounder. Hey. Let tell you what. I'm gonna schedule lunch. Can you come here and let's go to lunch together? I'm going to lunch. Like, I that's gonna happen. Use your time wisely. Most first time appointments can be easily conducted in a video call. You can decide at that point whether does it make sense for me to drive down to Downey and go in and spend time with you? Does that make sense? That's how I do that. Yeah. Jeb, I wanna ask you about you spent three days in person with a customer on-site with them, and there's some salespeople where it's like spending three minutes in person with a customer makes my head explode. There's a lot of salespeople who are especially newer in their career who have not ever really mastered the or experienced the art of the the on-site. Yep. And I'm curious if you can share some of the best practices for in person meetings, and there's a couple things I'm thinking about. Like, I'm curious about attire. I'm curious about when you go to their office, are you meeting in a big group in a conference room? Are you meeting one on one with a bunch of different stakeholders? Are you setting up lunches? Are you setting up dinners? Are you taking people out for drinks? What are you actually doing in those meetings? If you sell software, are you watching how they do the comparable process today to show, hey. Here's how you do it today. Here's how I do it. Talk to me about the things salespeople should be considering to nail their in person meetings. All of the above. So all so if if, yeah, if it makes sense to have drinks, have drinks. If it makes sense to have lunch, have lunch. In some cases, a deal I closed a couple years ago was and this is right before the pandemic, we closed this deal with a it was a startup company in in, San Francisco. And when I say startup, they'd gotten about a half $1,000,000,000 in VC money in through I think they were in their, like, or c round or something like that, but they've gotten a lot of money in. And they were they were struggling to grow. And I had a conversation with their CMO on the phone, talked a little bit. We hopped on the video, talked a little bit about it, and I just happened to be in on the West Coast. So I was in the neighborhood. And I said, can I come by and spend some time just observing your team? So it was just discovery. So I spent two days there. I'd I'd came in, spent a whole day walking around, listening to people, talking to people. We had dinner that night, came back the next day, spent another day and a half. And when I walked out, the deal was essentially sealed. I mean, it was you know, Kevin says, just get me the contract. The reason he said that was because we spent time together. We built a relationship. It built trust. It showed that I cared enough to to to pay attention to them. I learned a lot. It saved them money because I did a lot of the work that I would have charged them as a consultant to do anyway, but I just happened to be there. In in the case of, of going to Asia, we had meetings with people that had no decision making authority, but we would call them amplifiers. These are individuals that are gonna be impacted in the firm. So a lot of it was just interviewing them, spending time with them, learning about what they wanted. Mostly, it was listening. Now the thing about listening, and this is important for in in person or anywhere you are, but when you're listening to people, it gives them ownership. They like you more. So a great deal of what we were investing in was getting people motivated to work with us. I wanted people walking out of those interviews saying, you gotta work with them. And that's something we've used I've used it my entire life. So in a a deal we closed, I don't know, three years ago, it was a $1,500,000 deal training deal. There were 27 stakeholders that we spent time with. Now we did almost all of that by video because they were all over the world. But we would get them on just like this and say, tell me what's important to you. Walk me through this. If you could change this, what would you change? How would you do it? What's none of those people had any say in whether we're gonna get the deal done or not. But we asked to spend time with them because what we started doing was building these advocates. So when you're in person, what you wanna think about is this. The first question that people are asking about you is, do I like you? And that's gonna be at the both the subconscious and the conscious level. So you asked about what do I wear. Well, dress professionally and dress like day dress. So if I walk into tech, like, what I'm wearing right now, you can't see the bottoms, but I've got a pair of really nice custom made blue jeans on. This is this is what I typically wear when I'm walking in to software. I always wear a jacket. It's sort of my style. I like it. I'm fat, so it covers up fats, which is nice. So but I but I I typically wear a jacket and, you know, a pair of nice jeans and a button down shirt or what have you. In some cases, with some of my clients, I'll I'll take this off and I'll wear a t shirt because that's what they wear at work. But if you think about business, most business situations, most offices are pretty much business casual to some extent, and you never you never, never, ever, ever, ever will will do anything wrong by dressing just a step above your customer. Now if they're dressed in T shirts and you're in a suit and tie, that's not okay. But if you're just if you're dressed in T shirts and you put on a sports coat, you're gonna be fine. So you start there. Confidence. You gotta walk in and be confident. The most powerful emotional foundation for you for in person meeting is relaxed assertive confidence. Get your shoulders up, take a deep breath, walk in, and not arrogant, but like you belong there. Do that. But the easiest way to be likable is just listen. So the problem that we have when we walk in is we waste people's time because we spend all of our time talking at them. But the most unlikable human being in your life is a person who is standing in front of you talking about themselves. So what where salespeople fail is salespeople think, I gotta go in and pitch logic, and the customer's just thinking, do I like you? And the and and the easiest way to be likable is to listen. They the the the the other thing they wanna know is, do you make me feel important? Do you care about me? That's what I'm saying. I go spend two days on-site observing someone. I win just because I'm the I'm the sales rep that showed up and demonstrated that I give a crap. So do you make me feel important? Do you get me in my problems? Do you understand me? And what people wanna know is are you trying to understand them? So when you walk into an in person meeting, understand that at that moment, sales is a language of questions. Anything that you say will be more impactful in the form of a question. Anything. So ask a question. A question you ask is more important than anything. So take the time to learn about them and anything that you say, build a value bridge. In other words, connect the dots between what they say and their language and how you might be able to help them. Because in those meetings, what you're really working toward and getting to the next step, you're rarely walking into in person meetings closing the deal. Like, people like, Jen's asked, like, what would be your, you know, what would be your criteria? If it's a one call close, I can pretty much do that on the phone. If it's a one call close, I can do it on video. Unless I'm in a situation where people are coming to me. Like, if they're walking into my door face to face, then it's a one call close. But if you're going out in person, it's typically a multi call close. Like, it could be two, three, four, five. If it's a really large deal, you could be two years into it. Right? So you're closing for the next step. So you're using value bridges to get there, and then they just wanna know, can I trust you? Can I trust and believe you? So, Nick, your story about meeting with the cofounder and building a relationship and the cofounder gives you a hard verbal, the cofounder is saying, look, Nick, I trust you. I believe you, and I wanna sign up for this. Thing is is that I I gotta get other people in my company to go along with me because I'm not willing to put myself out there without some consensus from them. Now the onus is on you to try to put that consensus together in the right way without getting vetoed out of the deal by the other cofounder who says, not my idea. I'm not paying for this. Makes sense? And in that case, you gotta pay attention, and this is why we what we do in in person, you gotta pay attention to the two types of buyers that you may run into, and this may be your situation. You have one buyer that can say yes, and you've got one buyer that can fund the deal. And if you don't know those two people, that can get you in big trouble because you get hooked with the person that can say, yes. I'll sign the contract, but you never get funded because you've got a CFO out there that you've never met. And the CFO, by the way, is the one most likely to say, just send me the numbers, and I'll take a look at it and let you know. So what we're doing in person is we're basically walking people through this decision journey. Do I like you? Do you listen to me? Do you make me feel important? Do you get me in my problems? Do I trust and believe you? Those are the five decisions that people make about whether to do business with you or in the case of stakeholders who aren't direct decision makers, advocate for you. And here's what you have to recognize, and and I get this. People are nervous doing this in person, but the same thing happens on the phone and the same thing happens on video. Your buyer, your prospects, emotional experience as they walk through this decision journey with you is the most consistent predictor of outcome of any other variable. And this is why you, the salesperson, are so important. You're the most important tool in the entire toolbox. Right? It's your relationship that you build with people that creates that level of trust that causes them to want to work with you. And, Nick, your case is just so good for this because what you what you basically said is I was able to get this person to get so motivated to do business with me that they said, I wanna do business with you. Like, that's what we're trying to do with a face to face or an in person meeting. Okay. So let's do another hypothetical situation. Let's say I'm a a new rep. I've just landed my first in person meeting. It's with a team that can say yes, can say no. It's like, this is my prime opportunity. Talk to us about body language cues. Because I think when I first started selling, I was so focused on what I was saying and doing. I was not paying enough attention to what they were saying. So what are some good body language cues, bad body language cues we should watch out for? The problem with most new reps when they walk into a a situation like that is because I had the same problem. Like, you you had a like, my boss gave me a list of questions, and I just went from question to question to question to question. And the the the people are falling asleep. And I remember I remember the very first time I did this, I walked out in the parking lot because my boss was with me, and he just looks at me and goes, what's wrong with you? And I was like, well, I had a list of questions. Right? So the problem for most reps is they walk into those meetings at two really big issues. But number one is that they just go linear. Right? So they're so focused on what they're gonna ask that they don't really pay attention to what's happening, and this is called dual process. What you learn over time is to be both empathetic and outcome oriented. Right? In other words, I know what I'm I'm trying to get to. I know what information that I want, but at the same time, I need to allow those conversations to be organic. So I need to I need to shape those conversations with my questions. So my best advice for new reps in these situations is that what you wanna do is think, how do I be in control? Like, how am I in control of the situation? Because you feel out of control. Like, that's probably when you first the first time you're like, I shouldn't be here. This is the wrong place for me. Run. Right? But the person who is asking the questions is in control. And if you're asking open ended questions and you're getting people to talk, just get out of the way and let them talk. And then and this is important. To answer your question, you have to be intentional about deep listening. What deep listening is listening with your eyes, listening with your ears, and listening with your intuition. So when you see emotional cues, and you don't need to go to a body language class for this. Right? When someone says something and you notice that there's emotion, it could be any emotion, a good emotion or a bad emotion, ask questions about that. And where a lot of new salespeople go is they go, I don't know if I should ask a question about that. Is that too sensitive? I mean, am I would I be too pushy? What great salespeople do is they're they're pushing everywhere. They push the button push the button. If they go down a dead end, they just pull themselves back and go down another role. So that's what you wanna think about in that situation is is getting there. The the second mistake that new salespeople make when they when they meet face to face is they forget that at the end of the meeting, they gotta close for something. So if you're a new salesperson, what I want you to do is before you walk into that meeting and by the way, this is on phone and video too. Before you walk into that meeting, answer this question. What is my targeted next step? Why am I here? What am I asking for? And then with that intention in mind, make sure that you don't walk out of that meeting without asking for and gaining a micro commitment, a next step. That is the engagement piece. Right? So if I was go back to Nick over here. Nick, you're just probably telling me pick on you. But in a situation where you meet with the other cofounder, like, if I was coaching you ahead of that, I would say, what would be the the most obvious next step here? And you might say, well, close the deal. I said, well, if you can't close the deal, what are you gonna get? And he goes, well, I'm gonna get a commitment to meet with the other partner. Like, let's just say you knew that there were two there. I'm a meet with the other cofounder. So how would you do that? Well, in that case, like, looking back, now it's easy twenty twenty hindsight. You would say to the partner, sounds good. Sounds like we're out of business. We need to meet with the other person. Can you do me a favor and call and set that meeting up? Like, that would be my target next step. That would be what I would be closing for because now you're chasing. Right? And and the problem for chasing is that humans have a tendency to run from things that chase them, so that puts you in a bad position. So the two things I would say to you, Jen, is one, you have to be organic in those conversations, ask questions, and understand you're going for an outcome, a targeted next step, but allow the conversation to work. In the conversation, watch them. If you see emotion, ask open ended questions about that, and then do not leave that meeting unless you've asked for the next step. And make sure before you walk into the meeting, you know what the next step is that you're gonna be closing for. Jeb, this has been phenomenal, but we're running out of time. And we gotta move to the final question so you can get to your in person sales meeting. There you go. The last question for you is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing, and now I'm gonna ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question for you is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? It would it would be asking close ended questions. So one of the biggest mistakes I see with with especially young salespeople is that they think doing discovery is how many, how much, and they're, you know, they're asking, you know, are are you happy with your, you know, with your current vendor? Like, those type of questions. Stop asking close ended questions and start really focusing on asking open ended questions that get people to tell you their story. If you do that, you're gonna get so much more information. People are gonna lean into you because they're gonna love you because you care enough to ask, and you're gonna find that you're gonna have the information that you need at the end of those meetings to either close the sale or close for the next step.

Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode with Jeb Blunt. Number one, when you're getting in person, generally, you want to try to match the other company's attire, like, what they're wearing. I don't mean wear the same color. I mean, if they're dressing in suits and ties, you probably don't wanna show up in jeans and flip flops. Generally, however, you will never go wrong dressing one level above your customer. So if you're not totally sure, you're always better off being a little overdressed than underdressed. Number two, use the right communication tool for the job. You need to weigh the deal that you're working against the time effort needed for the communication tool that you're looking at against the impact of that communication tool, and that will help you decide. Should I get on a plane? Should I get on a train? Should I get on a bus? Should I walk there? Should I call them? Should it be a video? Use the right tool for the job. Number three. When making the decision of whether or not to go into person, three things to consider. Number one, the size of the deal. Number two, the proximity to where you are and the travel and expense costs that would be required to get you there. And then number three, where are you in the sales process? Discovery, according to Jeff, is actually probably an ideal moment to do it. Number four, last and final, before the meeting, make sure you ask yourself, what is that targeted next step I wanna achieve? Of course, we wanna close the deal, but what is that micro commitment you want from them so you can stay focused and make sure you get to that by the end of the meeting? Boom. Beautiful. And the micro commitment that we want the audience to take today is what, Jen? How can people help us out? Follow thirty minutes to presidents club on LinkedIn, and don't forget to give my wonderful cohost, Nick Sigelski, a follow as well. Oh, I deeply appreciate that, Jen. Thanks for listening, everybody, and we'll see you next week on thirty minutes to President's Club.
