## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have four, I don't even know what round it is, with the legendary John Barros. He is one of the greatest sales trainers of all time. He has trained the teams over at Salesforce, Google, LinkedIn, and a million other awesome companies. John got into a lot of things. Everything from how to get your customer to stack rank their decision criteria, how to get them to maybe think differently about their decision criteria, leading calls with your hypothesis as opposed to what are your priorities or what keeps you up at night. And then he talked about ways to earn more time with executives. I found the back half of this really, really valuable. So another great episode with the legendary JB. Three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, John. Welcome back to the show. You might remember we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. Let's go with decision criteria prioritized. We gotta put some objectivity into the sales process. Nine times out of 10, when sales reps are sitting there in front of a client and they ask about their decision criteria and how they're evaluating different vendors, it's super soft and it's very subjective. When that happens, you have to take a little bit of the challenger sale approach here and lead the charge. What I recommend everybody do is outline the top 10 things that people use to make decisions on their solution, and don't make them all beneficial to you. So put stuff on there like price, but don't just put price. Put things like total cost of ownership or dollar figure for a monthly investment, whatever it might be. Then have that list. And when a client is super vague, say, hey. Look. I appreciate that. Typically, we're dealing with a lot of clients who make these decisions. Here's here's the 10 things they tend to look at that some people miss in a lot of cases. Could you help me, force rank these and tell me what's most important to you and what's least important to you? And as you go through that process, if price is the number one thing on the list, here's my second tip for you, which is use the preemptive strike. So if you know the objection is coming where you are the top most expensive provider in the industry, If they put price as number one on that list or cost, then you need to preemptively address that right out of the gate and say, look, we are not the cheapest, and I use the word cheap very specifically. We are not the cheapest nor do we ever want to be. So if you are really looking as price as the number one, let's unpack that a little bit. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Which then gets to the third tip, which is layering questions. You wanna just get into, oh, you guys are too expensive, or we don't have budget for this. That's a scary objection. But what you can say is, what do you mean by we're too expensive? Compared to what? Compared to my direct competitors? Compared to missing your quota this quarter? Compared to losing, having some of your top reps leave because they don't feel like they're in being invested? Oh, and by the way, how do you look at cost? Do you look at it as total cost of ownership, or do you look at it as the dollar figure on the proposal that I'm gonna send you? Because I just need to get a better understanding. And the more you clarify an objection, the more the client talks and gives you information. And nine times out of 10, that initial surface objection is not really the objection. So you wanna get down to that point. So decision criteria prioritized, preemptive strike on objection handling, and clarification when you're not clear on what their challenge is so you can get super specific. You're hitting us with the chronological takeaways. I always love when that happens. So you're laying out the decision criteria. You're calling out the preemptive strike of if you're the price sensitive one, we're not the right folks for you. Mhmm. And then whenever they bring up an objection or something that's important to them, you clarify it. Yep. John, my guess is you don't show up with your list of 10 decision criteria and say, what is important to you? Pick one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Nope. How do you roll your way into this throughout? Obviously, you don't say this, but this is the mentality. Hey. You make this decision once a year. I help people make it every day. Let me show you where people make good decisions, bad decision. That comes across as pretty arrogant sometimes if you play that wrong, and you better have that business acumen be able to pull that off. I don't do that. I actually challenge people by asking them questions. So, Arman, if you and I are talking, they might look look. I understand your needs, what you're trying to accomplish. Look. I'm sure you're talking to other vendors here. Help me understand what is the criteria that you're using to evaluate the vendors so that at the end of the day, there's some objective criteria. And by the way, is your criteria the same as the other two, three, four, five people who are involved in this? And so I try to unpack that. And if they are vague, if they are we're looking at just who's ever the good fit and who's ever got the right personality and those type of things. I say, okay. That's great. I appreciate that. It's a little hard for me to really tailor my solution to some of those things that are a little bit subjective. A lot of the clients I work with, there's a lot of other factors here that sometimes go unnoticed. And so we've kind of gone through the process of outlining those with different clients we've worked with. And here's ten, fifteen different criteria that people, when looking at sales training, they tend to look at. So could we go through this and could you just tell me which ones are important, which ones aren't? And I'll give you an example. Like you guys know this as well as I do training at the end of the day is 50% the content, but 50% the person who delivers it. Like, you could have the best content in the world, but if you have a dud delivering it, it won't land. So personality fit is a huge factor when it comes to sales training. A lot of people don't think of that because what they're doing is they're being sold by the sales rep who is selling the training, but they don't meet the trainer who's ultimately going to train. And so a lot of times, I've seen disasters happen where the content looks great. It's a perfect fit, but then they put a dud trainer in front of their class, and and it just lands flat. And I'll explain that. I mean, like, what about the personality of the trainer? Like, how are you evaluating that? Because that's a huge difference. And then you'll see them go, oh. And now what happens is when I frame the prioritization, one, two, three, four, five, and we collaborate on that and I ask, oh, okay. That's not important. Okay. Cool. Now I got the top three, top five. I said, now I'm controlling the process. Right? Now, again, I wanna as I go through the sales process with people, I'm gonna validate it with the other people. Hey. I was talking to Sally, and she said these criteria were the ones that you were looking at. You you kinda looking at the same thing? No. Oh, you and Sally, we need to get together here so to to make sure that we're all on the same page because, otherwise, it's gonna be real hard for you guys to make this decision if you're not all on the same page of the criteria you're gonna use to make this decision. I've been here before. I get it. And I've worked with other clients on this, and I didn't develop these. We developed these. This is what they typically that word typically is a really good one. Typically, most clients look at these criteria. Could you help force rank these things for me so that we can be on the same page here? Examples of nonsales training criteria that you've seen people introduce in a sales process. People are scared to make a decision because nobody got fired for not making decisions. People get fired for making bad decisions. A lot of what I think we should put in there is risk factors, onboarding, adoption, resource allocation, those type of things. How long is this gonna take? And let's talk about the elephant in the room. Let's bring it up. So many people were taught in sales to to sell the dream. Right? To sell the oh, after you invest in this, your life is gonna be perfect. You're gonna have so much time back and all this No. Look. Everybody as soon as they've made the commitment that, yes, I know I need to change, now we need to derisk the situation for them. Right? Because all they're thinking about is every implementation that has gone bad, how long it's take, all this other stuff. And so I think we put in criteria in there to derisk that transition, whatever that might be, whether it's a customer service implementation team, whether it's a white glove service, where it's tailored this or whatever. So I think there's things that you need to put in there that uncover risk and, also, you can use as a talking point. Right? The more stuff you put in there I mean, obviously, you don't wanna have 50 things on that list, but you wanna put things in there to drive conversation around, okay. What if we did that, but yet nobody adopted it in the first month? Like, we could turn this thing on tomorrow. But if we didn't have the training and implementation, then none of your employees are gonna be able to really get the full benefit out of this until blah. So that's where no. We need that implementation. Okay. Cool. Well, you know what? Instead of me discounting, right, which is a lot of reps are just gonna run the discount, why don't I do this? Why don't I add in some services here to make sure that from day one, everybody's on the same page and your adoption is immediate so you can see the ROI within months as opposed to a year. So now we get out of the discount conversation. Right? Because now everybody's looking for the cheapest price. That's not really what's important. What's important is you get the biggest value out of this solution. So why don't we add this or do that or get creative with these? And, again, you you don't wanna put everything on there that is, like, perfect for you because then it looks like a pure sales tool. Right? So, look. We're great at all this No. You have to put things in there that you're not great at. And, again, that goes to the preemptive strike of qualification. If I put a bunch of things on there and say four or five of them are not in my favor, I'm gonna explore a little bit to make sure I clarify what does this mean, how do you think about that that type of stuff. But if those are genuinely their top four things, I am literally gonna walk away from that opportunity right out of the gate. I'll be like, hey. Thank you so much. Actually, I'm glad we went through this exercise because I'm gonna be upfront with you. Those are not my strengths. Those are not the strengths of the solution. Our strengths are in other areas. So if those are truly what you're looking for, then I highly recommend you go talk to x y z, whoever else. One of the challenges that I'll oftentimes see reps struggle with decision criteria Mhmm. Is it creates some objective decision criteria Yeah. To evaluate the sale. Mhmm. But sometimes it almost sterilizes Oh, yeah. Sale because people buy emotionally and they justify logically. And the problem is a lot of people will try to introduce decision criteria way too early before they understand the big drivers or the motivations or the priorities for why doing this thing at all. Yep. So I'm curious, John. It it sounds like the reason you're able to challenge them on their decision criteria is because you've mapped out their priorities in the first place. You've gotten the painful stories in the first place. So can you talk about what that process looks like before you start assigning the decision criteria to those priorities? Yeah. You're right. It definitely comes in towards the latter part of a discovery call. Right? Because I've done the discovery up to date to find out what the pain is. And is it really a problem worth fixing at this point? Another initiatives that they're dealing with, which by the way, sidebar, is another thing that most reps don't ask. Small nugget here is just make sure you understand all the other initiatives that are going on the business right now and where this one lines up as far as priority is concerned. Because this might sound interesting, but they might have five other priorities that they need to address, and therefore, you're gonna be touching base and checking in forever. So I think a lot of this has to do with the preparation that we do walking into a call. Right? There's so much you can do before a call that we can skip the line a little bit here with stuff. What drives me nuts, and I don't know if you guys saw this, I did a post a little while ago where I I tested this. I did 20 sales calls, and I had 20 sales reps pitch me on their all sales tech stuff. Right? So our wheelhouse here. And I was the customer. And I start every single conversation off like this. Okay. Hey. Great. Thanks for coming in, guys. I appreciate it. So before we get started here, could you do me a little favor? Tell me a little bit of what you know about me, my company, and that type of stuff before we get started. Dude, 14 out of 20 reps didn't have a fucking clue. 14 out of 20 reps did the whole I was on your website, but, you know, I'd really like to hear from you, which is a total tell telltale sign that you didn't know prep. I hang up on them immediately. But from there, they asked dumb questions like, tell me about your business, tell me about your priorities, what keeps you up at night. Like, those are the worst questions you could possibly ask anybody right now. I I I actually think tell me about your business is one of the most insulting things you could say to somebody. Think about the money people spend on SEO and marketing and everything to tell the world about their business. And and that you're gonna spend the first ten minutes of a conversation with me on that one. So my point is that there's a checklist I go through to prepare for every meeting. I go on their website. I see what they do. I look at their LinkedIn profiles. I come up with some theories about what's going on in their industry and what's going on in their business. I look at news and events, and I have all that information. So I'm not saying tell me about your business. Or tell me about your priorities. I'm saying, hey. You know what, Nick? We're working a lot of other VPs load right now in the SaaS industry, and some of the trends that are really impacting them are these. And some of the priorities are these. Are you seeing the same stuff? And it's not it's not telling me about your priorities. It's this is what I understand so far about your role based on what I'm seeing out there. Is it yours? Now your confirmation bias, it's much easier for somebody instead of saying, hey. Tell me about your priorities and open ended than to correct you, to say, actually, no. Those aren't my priorities, but these are. All you have to do is show a little bit. You don't need to know the details. I don't know what a CISO in cybersecurity does. I I didn't go to job to be a CISO. I don't know what all the things entail, but I can do a quick little search. I can go on a chat g p t and say, what are CSOs in these type of companies work with and what are the key priorities and initiatives? I can look at job descriptions. You know what I mean? So I think it's the preparation that we come with. And another small tip, and I'll finish, is I don't let people guess whether I prepared for meetings. I will literally say, hey. I'm on as I was preparing for this meeting, you know, I was looking through your website, and I noticed some things here. And I was kinda curious, and then I'll start with something I know about you, and then we'll drag it through there. So I'm doing all that to kinda set the stage, then I'm getting to the problem. I'm understanding what the problem is and how big that problem is and if it's worth solving. And then we talk through what the criteria they're they're gonna use to actually solve it. John, to make this real for the audience, can you give an example of either a recent VP of sales or CRO that you jumped on a call with? Mhmm. What did you find in your prep? Yep. And what did you raise at the beginning of the call? Yeah. So and I have pro I actually use a lot of AI tools just to get myself as the chat CPT where I can just put in give me some industry trends and how they relevant to the conversation I'm looking for. And then what's going on with this company, ten k analyzer? What are some of those things? And I'll even say, what are some questions I can ask that that uncover impact as it relates to all this stuff? And so when I was asking, the guy about, hey. I'm seeing some crazy happening right now in the SaaS industry as far as VPs of sales, all sorts of stuff, AI that and and I started with, here's some of the macro trends that are affecting the majority of my clients. And I'm curious. Are you seeing those same trends? And the guy straight up said, no. And I actually did this in front of an audience too because I wanted to prove a point. And the VP was like, actually, no. Those aren't impacting us at all. And the reps were like, see chat GPT is full of shit and that type of stuff. But they what they didn't realize or they didn't pay attention to was after he said, no. Those are not my priorities. He went on for five minutes about what the trends were that were impacting and how it was challenging. It's not that I knew the perfect answer is that guy just gave me five minutes of gold that I could now tie into it. And so it's really just more about knowing enough to be curious. And when you do that, you build credibility. You bring value because you're saying, hey. This is what I'm seeing out there based on what everybody else is doing. Are you seeing the same stuff? And you're helping them learn, and then you might be able to ask questions to get them to think. I I I ask very thoughtful questions. I always have a reason for my question, which is another tip out there for everybody. If you ever wonder if you have a good question or not, assume that the person asking you the question is gonna say, why do you need to know that? And if you don't have a good answer, don't ask the stupid question. So when you say, hey. Like, for instance, hey, Armand. I was wondering to know who else you're talking to? Who's the competition effectively? And, look, the reason I ask is because if you're talking to x, y, and z, apples to apples, pretty easy. But if you're talking to a, c, and y, apples to oranges to lemons, and you're gonna have a hard time making this decision. That's why I'm asking you. And you will literally watch people relax a little bit and be like, oh, that's okay. Let me give you the answer. I love how you broke it down from industry to company to persona to person level trends. Mhmm. I would categorize the companies that I was meeting with, the people that I was meeting with Mhmm. Into types of sales cycles. Yeah. So I had the 300 employee fast growing compensation company. And for those companies, it wasn't a massive problem today, but I knew they were gonna be really focused on hiring. Mhmm. I had the 5,000 employee beast legacy company trying to hold on to employees, and that was another archetype of company. And so I could bucket the different types of companies that I was meeting with into different buckets. Even if they weren't putting their priorities in public, I could at least start with something that would help me sound a little bit smart when I jump in the sales cycle. And so for everyone listening, John, you mentioned it a couple times where I've seen you even post videos where you use chat GPT to literally build all of your prep docs for you. Mhmm. If I wanted to do this myself Mhmm. You've got your industry prep, your company prep, your persona prep, and your person prep. Mhmm. What are you typing in the chat GPT Sure. To get it to spit out an intelligent response? Like, my thing is I customize my chat GPT. Right? So you go into the settings, and you say, how do you want it to act and what do you want us to know about you? So it's acting like me as the sales rep. So that's an important piece of this because otherwise, you start really random. So you have to actually train your GPT a little bit to make sure that it's giving you the type of answers and has your info in there. But I'll just simply say I'm going into medical device industry and that type of thing. I don't know anything about medical devices. Devices. Right? But there's a lot of shit that's going on in that industry right now. So I'll say, hey. What are some of the top trends that are impacting the medical device industry right now? And, you know, what are some of the macro trends? And then what are some of the trends that, are happening that potentially my sales training could help with? Right? So it says, okay. Here's some macro trends, and here's some micro trends that your stuff could potentially help with. What would be a good question I could ask a CRO in that space that would really show and get me insights into what trends they're seeing as it relates to this stuff? And I'll ask tell me the question to ask with a focus on impact or whatever it might be. Tell me about this business. Here's their website. Here's a 10 k. Upload the 10 k. Read that. Go look at some of the news and events. What are some of the bigger things that are happening in this business that are challenges specific to things that I could sell. Right? Sales training and those type of things. Now this person, I PDF their LinkedIn profile, and I also PDF their DISC profile using Crystal Knows. I upload that. I say, tell me what I need to know about this person. What are some of the big challenges that this person is dealing with, right, from persona standpoint? What's keeping them up at night? Those type of things. And I just talk to it. You know what I mean? Like, again, you don't have to be an engineer to do this. That's the beauty of it, is you just start asking. Just be curious. I think that's the key here is is you have to be curious. You you have to care enough to be curious. John, you've shared a couple different chapters of your discovery call. You're starting early by sharing your hypothesis around the problems that they have. You've got this piece where you're asking them about how much that matches up with their reality. Later in the call, you've got the thing with the stack ranking. You've got the question you ask about competition. I'm curious. My assumption is you have thirty minute introductory discovery calls. And if you think about how you structure those calls and the chapters of the call, I'm thinking stuff like report building, agenda, discovery, next steps. What's the ideal breakdown for a thirty minute call? What are the chapters, and how much time generally would you recommend somebody spend on each? Yeah. So I think this has to do with the persona of the person that you're talking to. Right? This is why I think profiles and and Crystal knows stuff is really important because there's certain people that need that rapport upfront. There's certain people that don't. Right? Certain people just get to the point. There's other people that you gotta talk for five to ten minutes about sports and weather and all that crap. So I think it's a little bit loose there. I'll start with, hey, Nick. As as I was preparing for this meeting, I actually noticed that either somewhere on LinkedIn, you did this or your news and events, you just did that, whatever it is. And I'm curious. Is that what's driving this conversation? Is that part of what's happening here? And what's that's doing is that's getting my temperature level down so I can relax a little bit, and it's getting yours up because you're talking about something you like talking about, which is you. So from there, I'll be like, okay. Great. Hey. Before we dive into some of the details here, do you mind if I just ask five or six quick six quick questions so we can just get this out of the way? I I always hate this part of the sales process, but it's really important for me to know. Yeah. Sure. And I literally say how many questions, like, five questions, four, whatever that is. If you don't quantify how many questions or whatever it is, after three or four questions, you're gonna get, could you just show me what you got? Could you just show the demo or whatever it is? But if I tell you five questions, you'll start and wait you'll wait for five questions. And then I'm like, alright. Perfect. Thank you very much for that. That gives me some good context here. Now let's talk about why we're here. You know, what what's the problem? Right? And why are we how big is this problem? Why is it worth addressing now? Those type of things. And then we go into the rest of the discovery. So I it's hard for me to break down kind of the specific timelines because everyone's a little bit different. Everyone's either willing to have that conversation or not. I tend to do a little bit of five to ten minutes of, I guess, rapport building slash qualification. Ideally, ten to fifteen minutes of real discovery of the problem, five to ten minutes of showing the components of my solution, not the whole demo. I don't ever believe somebody should go through a whole demo or a whole slide deck. I think it's a waste of time because I sell to the 20%. Think about it. Any product or service you own, you only use 10 to 10 to 20% of whatever the functionality of that thing is. So I'm trying to find that 20% to elevate because everything is average if I tell them it's all great. But if I find that part that's most relevant to you of what your priority was was, then I can lean in on that and everything else is table stakes, and hopefully I'll stand out. And then at the end, I summarize the next steps. I leave at least five minutes at the end for next steps. If you ever hear a prospect say, you've given me a lot to digest here. That's the worst fucking thing I can do. Your favorite thing. Yep. That means you showed way too much. Or the other way that I oftentimes hear it come out is it feels like a little bit more than what we need at this stage. And the reason is that is not why. Your product has different avenues, and you can activate different parts of it. The problem is you showed them all of the parts of the product that they could possibly need if they were the perfect customer who could have every single use case in the world. And so, John, when you're doing that first initial, we'll call it a demonstration because in your training, you're still demoing Yeah. Your training. You're still you're demonstrating what your program is gonna look like. Mhmm. What does that initial five minute teaser demo look like? Like, how much do you actually show? I don't ever believe that you should qualify, discover, and then demo. I think you should do it fluidly throughout the old thing. So when people are bringing up certain things throughout the conversation, I'll be like, oh, it's interesting. Actually, you know what? Let me show you something real quick here. Here's the part of our here's how we do that. What you do is you kinda show them the piece that is most relevant to what they said that they were interested in, and then you pause and you say, hey. Could you explain to me how that compares to what you're doing now? Or could you explain to me how that fits into your existing workflow? Because the way that you explain to me how it compares to what you're doing now or how it fits into your existing workflow tells me everything I need to know whether or not it made sense. And so I'm kinda doing that ebbing and flowing and showing, like, a piece of it and going from there. Because the problem that most reps do is they discover, which usually, you know, in a discovery call visually, hopefully, you're leaning in, clients leaning in, we're engaged. But then when when okay. Let let me show My demo comes up on the screen, and I go into demo presentation mode. And guess what? You go into demo in presentation mode, and you do exactly what you did there, Nick. You lean back in your chair, you grab your email, you bring it right under my eye line, and you pretend like you're you pretend like you're actually paying attention. And you say, sure. Great. Sure. Great. And there's no engagement. And the rep, although, because we've stuffed it down their throat from an enablement standpoint and told they have to hit every slide so they can get their stupid badge, they feel like that's the thing to do. And most reps, at least in myself included early days, I would just talk really fast. If I thought I had thirty minutes and now I only have five or 10, I'd be like, okay. And I would just really run through everything, and I'd feel really proud of myself for getting through the whole thing. And that's obviously the worst thing that could happen because to your point, you're gonna say, okay. So in that case, and here's a tip for everybody, and even young sales reps, if a CEO ever does that to you I'm sorry. I only got about five minutes. What do you got? You go, okay. There's no way we can get through everything that we need to get through here in the next five minutes. So what's the one thing you need to hear from me in the next five minutes here that will earn the right for me to have a longer conversation with your undivided attention? What's the one thing you need to hear from me in these five minutes to earn the right for your undivided attention and a more deeper dive conversation about this, and that's punching the CEO back respectfully. I think a lot of sales reps would benefit from hearing that own question in their own head. Yeah. Even if the prospect didn't ask it on an initial demo, you've gotta think, what is the biggest problem that they've shared with me? Mhmm. And how can I show them the biggest way we can solve that problem without showing them all of the ancillary details? Yeah. And a win in that initial demo is oftentimes show them the one massive thing Mhmm. And then tease one or two other problems, but barely. One more piece is I just sales reps need to stop selling. They need to start be be like, really focus on being problem solvers. And sometimes, quite frankly, in the discovery process, you realize that the problem they have is not something you can solve, which is okay. And so the idea is you wanna be able to bring as much value to that conversation as you possibly can. Somebody said this early in my career, and I I still abide by this to this day, which is after he walked out of a a a conversation, he'd wanna ask the client, would you have paid for this? And not that they would have paid a ton of money, but the concept there is, did you get enough value out of this conversation that you would have bit, like, maybe paid a few bucks for it? So for me, not only am I trying to find that problem and show them something and give literally give it to them. Yeah. Here's that template. Here's the cadence. You can actually run with that today. I'm also bringing on other resources, like, other people in my industry who are better at certain things than I am. I'd be like, ah, you should. Here's a book. You should actually you know what? You bring that up. You gotta go read Jolt Effect. It's one of my absolute favorites. Hey. Crystal knows. Did you do you know that you can actually do this and you can upload the so the goal is, like, people like, holy I've literally had people say to me, John, the reason we went with you is because every single time we had a conversation with you, we learned something. Whereas every time we had a conversation with every other rep, they were always trying to qualify and sell us and and tell us why they were the best. You never said that you were the best. You just kept bringing value to the equation, and you you were the best. And so that's where, like, taking the sales hat off and putting the problem solver hat on and being curious enough to figure out what that real problem is and not being afraid to walk away when it's not something you are great at. John, the clock is ticking. We're running out of time. We gotta move to the final question, which is this. Yep. What's one bad habit you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break? Because it hurts them more than it helps. The automation. Stop with the automation. Like, the like, this AI stuff is driving me nuts. These auto generated AI comments on LinkedIn, these auto generated emails because they look at how efficient I am. Like, you're not learning anything that way. The give a factor is real. It's the only thing that AI really can't do. AI can pretend to care, but it can't really care. It can't give a And so reps going through the motions, like, if you're trying to automate all this stuff because it's so cool and it's better than what you've been doing, it's a race to the bottom, and you're gonna be automated out of a job. Fine. Let AI do all the heavy lifting on all this shit. But before you hit send, before you have that conversation, you better make sure you humanize this, and you better make sure you learn from it and then use it, not just get it to produce something and hit send. It's business acumen on steroids if you use it the right way. But if you try to automate off, augment, learn, and be the last mile. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with John Barros. What do you have for you too? So number one is if you get on a meeting with an executive and they tell you, hey. I know we were scheduled for thirty minutes, but I actually only have five. Do not try to cram a thirty minute meeting into five minutes. Instead, ask them this one question, which is, what is the one thing that you need to hear from me today to earn the right to get another meeting with you where I will have your undivided attention? Now you can figure out what do you need to do in those five minutes to get a real meeting with that person. Number two is instead of picking off your discovery calls by asking the prospect a number of questions, tell me about your priorities, tell me about your business, What matters most to you right now? Lead your meetings with a hypothesis of what you think matters to somebody in that industry, at that company, based on their persona, based upon the projects you even think they're taking on. And when you lead with your hypothesis, even if you don't get it a 100%, now you've shown, hey. I did a ton of prep for this. I really care. And they will respond in kind and actually give you the full story, which you'll get way more than if you just asked, tell me about what's going on. Number three. The first thing you're oftentimes doing is you're asking your prospect how they're thinking about their decision criteria. But oftentimes, it's wrong or they're thinking about the wrong things. And so then what you wanna do is you wanna pull up a list of 10 decision criteria that other people like them have typically considered and then ask them to stack rank those things. And then lastly, number four, don't wait till the end to do a massive demo dump. Instead, demo as you go. It's okay to show them a page of the product, two pages of the product. Take it off the screen, do a little bit more discovery, and then continue doing demo later on. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So you and I, Armand, did a YouTube video recently where we talked about how we structure our discovery call, the types of questions that we ask, and then we also did another one around, like, how to bookend the front and the back of a call to keep the momentum in your deal cycle. So if you liked this episode of the John, I think you would like that series that you and I did on YouTube, and you get to see our smiling faces in conjunction with our wonderfully pleasant voices. And, also, John has a really great sales newsletter. It's one that I'm subscribed to. There are a lot out there. John's is actually valuable, and he writes it, not AI. So I recommend checking it out. There's a link in the show notes. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
