## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have a stellar enterprise sales leader. It's the one and only, mister Ford Williams, at the one and only, ThoughtSpot. Nick, why should people listen? Sometimes salespeople get stuck with blockers, meaning you're talking to someone, and you can't get any higher in the organization. They say, sorry, Armand. Sorry, Armand. Please do not talk to our CFO. Even though you know you know in your heart of hearts that that CFO needs to be involved to get the deal done. And Ford is one of our best episodes we've had on how to navigate working with blockers to actually get to that CFO. Three, two, block. You cannot listen to this episode. One. Now you got the power. Enjoy the show. Oh, jeez. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Ford. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Arman. First is change your calendar. I see more often than not that sales reps have tons of solo invites on their calendar, lunch on their calendar, go for a walk on their calendar, or prep time on their calendar. Change it. Eight to six, seven to six should be just customer facing. You can find time to prep late in the afternoon or early in the morning. We all have kids and so forth, and I understand that you don't always have time. But seven to eight, no one's picking up the phone, perfect time to prep. Four to five, less people pick up the phone. Another big one I see regarding calendars is that people all the time are building the perfect deck, the perfect x, the perfect y for that meeting. Don't do that until you have the meeting. Book the meeting and work your way back. But don't do all that work, and then there's no guarantee of the meeting. That's a waste of time. So go look at your calendar right now, review it, see what you can be moved off of it. Internal meetings. But really, the ones that really shoot salespeople in the foot are their own meetings that they need to be reminded of. Think of a better way to remind yourself. Think of a better way to block off your time so you're maximizing time with your customers. Beautiful. What's number two, Ford? Get to your economic buyers or EVs early and often. Always be going after your EV. Is your EV, your economic buyer, in your PG plan? Are you personally calling this individual? Are you personally emailing them, trying to establish a connection with them? If that's failing, are you using your executives or your board to get to them? Once a connection or relationship is established, never let it go and never fully outsource it out. You should always have a relationship with that economic buyer. Example, are you sending a weekly update on your POC, proof of concept, and how it's going to that economic buyer? Are you bringing in the executive to also engage with that economic buyer on a regular basis? You don't wanna just hit that economic buyer at the very end for the deal. So keep them updated at all turns. Compliment their team to them. They love hearing about that. They built that team from scratch. Compliment them and keep them engaged. It's my second one. Beautiful. What's number three, Ford? Round us out. Qualify on every meeting. Almost every sales rep can tell when a deal is not going to happen. It's the deals that will happen, but for very small that we all lose. We Get to the end of sales cycle and they say, yeah. We budgeted $30,000 and you were expecting 250 k. How do you change that? You qualify for every meeting. One thing I always did for and I was taught this by, actually, Parm up a lot of app dynamics was for every first meeting, new business meeting, once the meeting's booked, once you get that accept, ask for a prep call. It's just simple as this. Hi, Sarah. Thanks for the meeting next Tuesday. I wanna better customize the deck, demo, and messaging for you. Can I get fifteen minutes this week? You get that fifteen minutes, and now you have carte blanche to ask questions for fifteen minutes. So you wanna ask questions about their pain that you will solve, the use cases, etcetera. But really what you wanna get at is, is this worth my time? Am I gonna make money? Will this put an actual dent in my quota? So even before you start that sales cycle, you're going into it knowing its size, knowing if it's meaningful to you, knowing if it will make a mark on your year. There's three. Alrighty. So, Ford, you're operating in a a pretty intense enterprise environment where your reps might only have 10 accounts, for instance. And if you only had one contact you were working on one of your 10 accounts, that's a really slow way to hit your number on a book that small. So let's say that I might have contact with a director or manager at the company that I'm trying to prospect into, but it's a slow crawl to power through them. How do I get to power in that type of sales cycle without disrupting the relationship with my initial champion? I would actually say when you're reaching out to that initial champion, your PG plan should always be high and wide. So more often than not, we start low or start in middle management. And then, we are trying to get up and that person becomes a blocker. Because we've inadvertently given them power to block us. By calling them, by empowering them with our meeting, with our love, with our champion building, we've empowered them to make a decision or to run a process that they're not fit to run, or maybe they haven't done a project like this before. So to answer your question, I'm kind of answering asymmetrically. But don't ever just go after that mid level management because it's very hard for them to block you if you're already talking to people above them. They almost have to get on the train instead of be in front of the train. So that'd be the first big one. And then if if that person does become a blocker, it's okay to outsource that work to people above you at your company. That blocker or that middle management person can't really say, hey. Your CEO shouldn't reach out to my CEO. I don't control my CEO's calendar. I'm not his EA, and you're not your CEO's EA. So that's also a creative way to get around that. So, Ford, let's say that we have a champion, and they have gone and pre proposed to the economic buyer. This is what ThoughtSpot does. This is why we think it's gonna be valuable. Maybe here's a screenshot or two, what have you. Here's the use case. Now that executive is primed. They jump on the call with you. How are you making use of those thirty minutes? Well, we should have a tight agenda, and the agenda hopefully has been shared with the EV beforehand. Right? Hopefully, it's not just in the invite. You you send that them in their EA, maybe champion. You it's probably a big threat at this point, five or six people, the proposed agenda. Please let us know if you'd like to cover anything else. And then when you do show up, I believe slides are a good thing. It's nice to have something tangible. 10 slides is too many for an EB meeting. You should have two, three, four max, and they should be tight. I personally like to start with value. I decide I've chosen to really show value through three whys. Why anything? Why ThoughtSpot in my case? Why now? Right? So why anything? Why your company? Why now? I think one slide. The more metrics that can be on it and the more quotes that can be on it, the more impactful. If you can have quotes with metrics from people that CEO or economic buyer recognize, tons of credibility in that. Two, I sometimes see this. I kinda like this one a lot, a timeline slide. Maybe that's slide one and slide two's and three wise. I also really like a timeline slide. A lot of times, they don't know the level of work that you have put in, but also their team has put in. They're thinking maybe this got to them a month in or two months in. And a lot of times, you'll be six months in or five months in. It's like, woah. And it that's a credibility. It's credibility measure. It also it it kinda hastens everything from there on out. They'll wanna move a little faster. And then you're with an EB, so you should make an ask. So that slide three or four, it should be both a proposal or pricing discussion, and it's all pricing and proposal discussions are time based. So you should also ask about time, see if you can do it in quarter, in year, whatever is important to you. Gotcha. There's a lot going on here. And so to play it back here, having your champion preface, the use case, the why, a lot of the things that they might have technical questions on just so you can get those out of the way. And then you're really focusing your meeting on the why and getting specific into a business case and then making an ask on timeline to your economic buyer. Ford, I have to assume that this is later in your sales cycle oftentimes because it sounds like there's a lot of work that you've done early in your sales cycle to get to this point. Right? And so for the audience, what I would love is a lot of people don't understand how an enterprise sales cycle can be six months long. Can you help orient us around where this is in the deal cycle? In other words, like, what are the key meetings that have happened up until this point that got us here in the first place? It's a fantastic question. I just wanna start with everything I'm about to say is conditioned by have you qualified it. Do you know you're working a deal that's worth it? Like, working a big meaty sales cycle that may take six months isn't worth it unless there's big spend on the other end. So just be cognizant. So you're absolutely right. What we're talking about is probably what I would consider. We have every company has different sales cycles, but I'd say you're either 80 or 90% of the way through. Basically, they that meeting is one of the last meetings that I that we've been describing. Sales cycle usually starts right from the first meeting. PG maybe, but really the first meeting. POC, and that's where you get a lot of those metrics, the quotes, the proof points. And then, hopefully, you've already met with the EB or keeping that person up to date. And you're building everything I've talked about, that timeline, that three whys, all that credibility, but you're documenting everything. You gotta document everything you learn. So that EB meeting, the executive engagement, hopefully, it's early. The earlier, the better that you can start it. But when you start it, it can be light. It can be just about relationship building. But by the time where we talked about where you're probably only a few meetings away, you're probably 80 or 90% of the way done. So, Ford, I have a real world example that I wanna ask you about how I should handle. So I do all of our sponsorship sales for thirty minutes to presidents club right now, and I've got a customer who they have some small spend with us. But recently, I got lucky, and I got to meet with the CMO of that customer. And that person shared two big problems that he's looking to solve, sort of initiatives that he's focused on. And where we came out of that meeting was Nick is gonna put together sort of a rough strategy about, hey. Here's how I think we could solve some of those with you. And then I'm gonna go run with that person's team assuming that they're happy with that strategy on, like, building out a plan for how we're gonna execute on this thing. And I'm sitting here thinking about a couple things. One, assuming that this person likes the strategy that I came back with, which I think they will, how should I be keeping them updated as I work with their team throughout sort of the building out of the sales cycle? And then two, I don't know how big to swing. Like, I don't know how big of an ask I should have budget wise. I don't know. Should I be, like, keeping it small? Should I be swinging for the fences and potentially overshooting? I'm curious your guidance on this sort of situation that I don't know how to handle. It's a great question, and there's a lot in there. I'll start with the updating piece. Right? You you've done a fun fantastic job, Nick. You already got to the EB, and now you're gonna go come back on ways you can solve or or address the two initiatives. There's a couple ways. One is the mid POC check-in. I know it's not a POC in this industry, but kind of the mid engagement check-in. Like, hey. I wanna check-in a week or two from now. I know we're not gonna be done, but just to make sure we're on track. Like, what we've done to date is exactly where you want it to be at the end state. So I like that. My team, I I give credit a lot to my team here. They do a fantastic job of this. I I specifically see this from Mitch Mueller, which is he will send quotes from the team or do a lot of what he gains from the team and take it and send it to EB. Instead of I'm updating them, he's really using their words or their work, you know, depending on the industry, and sharing it with the EB. I think that's impactful. It gets back to the, I'm complimenting you on the team you've built, and now I'm showing you the fantastic work we're doing together to address your two initiatives. And then how big to swing? This is such a phenomenal question because we just ran into I just ran into a situation where we didn't swing big enough, which was tough. I think, first of all, how big to swing? Back to my my one of my themes today, which is qualify early and often. Keep qualifying. Two, I think you have to be curious in that how big is their company? How big is their marketing spend, things that they may not share with you but maybe public, or you may be able to figure out from other podcasts or other places they spend money. Are you about to ask for $50,000 for yours and another podcast with the same number of viewers gets 500,000? In my world, that'd be the partner ecosystem. I'd be calling Snowflake, Redshift, Databricks, trying to understand their spend, right, and get that in yours and maybe another podcaster or another traditional means of advertising. Also, how to swing big? At the end of the day, Nick, there's also an art part of this. There's a lot of science, whether it's everything I just mentioned. There's an art. Understanding their business, understanding the people you're working with, knowing your momentum. As I said, we we came up a little early. The customer really want us to share pricing. My team, I was like, don't don't. It it's not the right time. We were kinda forced to do it. We did go big, but then we got on-site, and this champion set us up with the CIO. This is a one of the top five pharmaceuticals in America. He set up with the CIO. He set us up with we had a 150 person meeting where we showed everyone there. And there was just like, woah. We have so much momentum. And frankly, there's gonna be so much demand. I'm not gonna charge them more anything, but it's like, there's gonna be so much demand. We got we maybe we did a bad job kind of scoping out the demand here, and we should've just waited a week to scope out the demand. And so back to your question, Nick, there is definitely a science part of it, whether it's checking with partners, knowing their spend, etcetera. But there's also an art part of it of knowing your momentum in the account, how strong is your champion, how favorable is the EV on you. So there's definitely a science in there. One thing that I oftentimes worry about is I wanna be pricing high because I want us to be perceived as the winner in the market and the premium solution. And oftentimes, people will feel like they get a great win if they got the most expensive tool at a more reasonable price. Right? Because there's perceived value based on where you priced at the beginning. However, the other concern that I have is economic buyers very, very quickly can make prioritization decisions and kill things. And sometimes I have concerns about pricing so high that I don't even get the chance to negotiate. So people immediately walk in the deal. So I'm curious. Once you get to the commercial side, how do you think about where your ask lands such that you don't price so high that you scare someone away? I think it's when you when in the sales cycle are you talking about pricing and with who? So we've all been on those early calls where you you know you're talking to someone low level, but they just want pricing and they won't let it go. And you have to be confident in your list pricing. You just have to be confident in that. Here's an example. I need to know your pricing, you know, and you just can't get around it. You can't get off this call without it. I would say two things. One is, here's our list price. There's two things that affect it. Volume. We have volume discounting. Secondly, timing. If you do this this year, it's gonna be less. So those are the two things. So we've seen plenty of customers get much lower than that price, but those are the two things. Later on in the sales cycle, you can get a champion to coach you on the pricing. Are you being too aggressive? Are you not being aggressive enough? Are you not including enough things? What's important to them, but also what's gonna be important to procurement? This doesn't always happen, by the way. Don't get me wrong. But recently, I've seen a few times where someone said, this is what's important to procurement. This is what's gonna be important to them. So if you can kinda get that inside baseball coaching, it's helpful. So I would say be aggressive, be more confident in a higher price because after everything I said, you can always go down. You can't go up. So, Ford, a lot of what you're describing is contingent on having a stellar champion Yeah. That's willing to give you the inside baseball, so to speak. And that requires a number of things, which is number one, you need to have trust with them such that they're willing to give you that information. But then number two, they also need to be smart enough that they even know what the inside scoop is and they don't lead you in the wrong direction. So I know you've talked about these four steps of champion building a couple times, and so I actually wanna drill a little bit deeper into this. So the first step that you talk about in champion building is identifying a champion. And I think you do some really, really interesting things, like looking at who listens when they speak in the room to figure out if this person has any political clout. So upon first sight of someone who you think might be a champion, how do you go about sussing out if you think they're a worthwhile champion to guide you through a sale? So how do you identify that champion? They join a meeting. You may not even set it with them. They join. And when they walk in the room, do people take notice? When they speak, Zoom, does everyone listen? When you're discussing the next steps at the end of the call, are they the person setting the next steps with you? Are they the one driving it? Another one, are they asking tough questions? I think a junior sales oh, they're asking tough questions. I wanna stay away. But if they're tough but relevant questions, that means they've actually they probably have brought other projects in. Like, they have scars from delivering on other projects. That's another one. Of course, where do they sit in the org? Who do they report to? Good one is, did they follow the economic buyer here from a previous company? Or have they worked together before? Is this the right hand man or woman of the economic buyer? So there's a few. There's many, and I can keep going, but you absolutely need to identify. Because if you don't identify correctly and then you go to step two, three, and four, hopefully, we'll cover, you have wasted a ton of time. And you another one, Armand. You said smart enough to coach, smart enough. It's hard to have a champion who's only been there for six months. They need to know their way around the organization. They need to know what levers to pull, what's important to people. So are they intelligent enough? That's another one I would add to identifying. Well, it's really interesting what you just described because in a perfect world, you win over every single person that you ever meet with at the organization. But we don't live in a perfect world, and you have to place bets on the people you're going to invest your effort into win over. And what you just described are two things that the audience can do. One is the person who is asking you the tough but relevant questions. They can't just be the person who's, like, doing the stump the chump thing and asking you a bunch of weird questions. If they're asking relevant questions that are hard, that's actually a signal that that's the person you should be putting effort into winning over. And then I really like the one where it's like, oh, okay. Nick followed Arman from org a to org b. Like, they must be pretty tight. This is a person to win over. I think I understand step two, which is build. That's sort of the next piece of your framework. Like, okay. Build relationship with that person. Connect with them. Talk to me about testing, said champion. Test. Test is the most overlooked and skipped step, and it's the step that kills you because then you go to use or leverage. And you ask for the purchase or something of that level, and they're unable to deliver because you have a test. So how do you test? One is, can you share an org chart with me? Can you show a screen share of the procurement process, your Coupa? Do you mind sharing that person's phone number? Do you mind making an introduction? So what's so important about test is don't skip it. Like, make sure you're doing tests along the way because when the big ass comes, it will be late in your quarter. It will be late in your year, and you'll have a time frame that you have to hit. So make sure to test. So can you unpack this one a little bit more? I I love this concept of I almost imagine, like, you're on the sidelines, and it's a quarterback talking to their coach. And you have the squares and the arrows, and you're almost, like, planning your next three plays together. Walk us through what are you doing. Are you literally, like, drawing an org chart together and saying we're gonna start with this person, then go here, then go here? How do you game plan a sales cycle with a champion? Armand, that's such a fantastic analogy, actually. It's not unlike that. So it can happen many different ways. The the way I was just describing that actual story, we were doing in terms of spend. How would we get to spend? What can we cut? What was the number of that product? What was that product? How much was that? How can we cut? We could get budget from this group. We could get budget from that group. So we are basically doing a whole math equation that had multi factors, the tools, the people, as well as where we can get budget. That's one. But you also hit on another one that I see is when a lot of times you are doing an org chart. I have done that as well on a piece of paper. You're kind of or just on a Zoom or a call. But, hey. These are the people, and this is what's important to them, and this is how we're gonna win them over. And you start assigning functions and roles. I can take this person. This person will wanna speak. This person's you know, when you're talking to a champ, a lot of times, test hey. This person's got an ego. We need to bring in what your your c suite to talk to this person. This person's super technical. Can you bring in your technical person? So it is much like x's and o's of Joe Montana and Bill Walsh. You're absolutely getting into it at that level. Well, Ford, what you're doing is I find that the best sellers are able to almost get a prospect to forget that they are a sales rep. And one way to do that is you go from asking, can you do this? Right? Can you get budget? Or can you get your boss to sign off on this? To getting on the same side of the table and saying, shoot. I'm hearing it's gonna be tough to get budget. Hey. I've seen budgets get approved a lot. Like, could you give me a sense of, like, what's in there? Because I might be able to give you a couple ideas on where other customers have pulled things out, or maybe we can, like, jam on this together and figure out how we can make room in the budget. And so you're basically bringing them on the same side of the table, and you're saying, hey. Let me help you unpack some of these walls. And meanwhile, they've actually forgotten that you're trying to sell them something, which is great. And so now you've tested your champion, and, hopefully, you've aligned on some sort of game plan, and you realize that they are willing to embark on this game plan with you. And you have some really, really interesting things to do when you're using your champion. And so where are the most common places that you actually make that big ask in your sales cycle? It sounds like a lot of it is around, like, procurement and whatnot. A few different areas. I think if you have a champion early, getting the POC off the ground, that's definitely a big one. Can you help whatever your technology requires to get off the ground? A lot of times you need IT or security permissions, and you can get those permissions. You just need someone pushing. So that's one. Another big one is legal. Legal does not prioritize anything. They're not told to prioritize. Why should they? They don't have the context. So another ask your champion is getting legal through. You can even get very tactical there. Because some things you just can't give on on legal, whether it's indemnification or whatever it may be. So you may have to go to them and say, hey. We're at our max, truly right at max. Can you lean on your legal to meet us halfway? So that there's there's tons even in legal. That's another one. But remember the definition, at least my definition is someone that sells on your behalf and has influence over the EB. So more often than not, it's all headed after you've done some of those, and there's many more. Can you get us the meeting? Can you bring us to the EB? Because ideally, you wanna be in that room. Frankly, you don't just wanna have your champion because they may get tough questions they can't answer. Remember, you're the expert on your product. So can you get this meeting? And if that meeting happens and is successful, then it turns to can you help get the deal done in a time frame that's meaningful to us? There's more. As I said, you get just in a legal you can get into an order form and get into terms, like things that you're willing to give. And and as you said, you wanna slide that chair around the desk. You're on the same side. What's important to you? Let me go fight for you. The whole time you're fighting for your champion. So even though we're using terms like test and use, the champion hopefully is benefiting even more because they're getting so much more from this relationship because you have their relationship. They can make ask that someone at a distance could never make of you. So, Ford, a couple of times, you've talked about specific things that happen in vendor review, whether it's procurement, legal, what have you. And this is oftentimes one place where possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars can swing in one direction or another. So you've done things like pulling your champion to the side and being like, hey. Look. We're really tapped out here on the legal side. I know this is our wall. And what you're doing is you're basically going behind the scenes and using your champion to nudge their team internally and say, hey, guys. Back off. I know that we can't push on this one anymore. Are there other things you're doing to pull more information, whether that might be I don't know. Maybe you you know you ask them if procurement typically likes this amount of discount, so that means you need to pad the quote this much, or are you able to dig in around how aggressive legal tends to be? In other words, how much inside baseball can you get from your prospect, or what should reps be asking about the procurement and vendor review process that a legal or procurement person would never tell you? I wanna start with, as you go into procurement, you should be checking with other vendors and partners that have gone through this process and knowing what God asked of them, what they had to do to get the deal done. Right? If you can just get three or four to talk to you, you're gonna be in such a better shape. So that being said, what are you asking of them of that person? The first and foremost question is what's important to you and what's important to the EB? Great. Get that. What's important to procurement? What I mean, that shifts, by the way. Let's be very clear. That changes all the time. What's important to procurement today is very different than it was twelve months ago with how the economy has changed. Right? And it changes all the time. So you wanna ask them. Also, you wanna ask procurement what's important to them. They'll come out and say it. So you wanna ask everyone what's important to them. And then I think once you know what's important to them, you know where you can give and not give. So a good example let's get back to that legal one. Legal doesn't really hurt me as a salesperson. I mean, in the broader scope, it could hurt the company if we get sued into oblivion. Right? But, like, it doesn't hurt my paycheck. So as long as it's within the realm, that's something I can give on. But more often than not, sales reps, especially newer sales, make this mistake. Oh, I can give on it, so I will. You have to make them earn that gift. So when they're coming for you over on something that really matters to you, Maybe like the unit cost. Hey, I can't do that, but if we go from five x to six x on indemnification, would that matter? Or I can't do this, but if we give you something free because you mentioned you want a developer playground. So if you can get what's important and then make them earn those, you can maybe maintain some of your margin, maintain some of your price point. Ford, this is brilliant. I wish we could go even longer and longer and longer, but we are running out of time, so we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We have talked about a lot of great things that salespeople should be doing. Now we gotta talk about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps. I just came across this one in the past two or three years. Salespeople are always inadvertently enabling their blockers. They're enabling their blockers. They come back and say, I'm blocked. This person's blocking me. I can't get higher. And more often than not, they've created that situation. They create that situation to start by PG ing into the wrong people. They create that situation by engaging with that person past the first meeting. They create that situation by running the POC through them when they should have never run a POC with that person in the first place. Right? They create that situation by being a supplicant to that person instead of an equal. Even though we're selling to people, we are their equal and they are our equal. All men and women are equal. So when you need to just be an equal, you're not blocked. That person's not your boss's EA or their boss's boss's EA. They don't decide the decisions for the entire company. And so if I could just give one tip is don't inadvertently enable your blocker. Don't p g into them. Don't love them. Don't spend time with them. Realize that you're with a blocker, and then just don't engage. Boom. Beautiful. Ford, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon.

Your top four takeaways from this episode with Ford Williams include, number one, don't enable your own blockers by prospecting into people below the line or taking a million meetings with a non economic buyer or a non champion. Number two, when you do have a champion, use that champion to pre brief your economic buyer so that when you meet with your EB, that meeting can be focused on solving business problems, not technical problems. Number three. One way to figure out if you even have the right champion is figure out who takes the next steps. Look at who gets listened to when they speak. And also, listen to the types of questions they're asking. Make sure they're the ones asking the tough questions. And lastly, number four, when you're in a negotiation, play the table with all of the asks. And one trade off you can make is if someone has a monetary ask, decline the monetary ask and exchange it for a nonmonetary ask. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here?
