## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Frogg, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And, folks, today, we are live in studio with one of the greatest leadership guests we have had of all time. She is Eleanor Dorfman. She has led sales organizations and customer success organizations at Clever, at Segment, and most recently as the head of sales over at Retul. Those are three freaking awesome companies. So, Nick, why should people listen? So Eleanor talks about how she measures whether or not AEs are doing a good job, and she does not just look at quota attainment. There's a number of different behaviors that she measures, and she measures them in a really interesting way to make sure that people aren't gaming the system, like, artificially creating pipeline, etcetera. And so this helps her have a really, really transparent handle on holding people accountable in a way that makes her not a total and utter jerk. And then she also talks about one of the areas that I think sellers often point at leaders in saying, oh, you're being a jerk, which is how she approaches ROEs or rules of engagement. And so if you're a sales leader in a scaling, growing org, this was a really, really good listen. Alrighty, Eleanor. Welcome back to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Number one is that we all know quota attainment is the most important metric to track for your reps in terms of are they successful, how are they performing, But how they get there is usually just as important. And when you're trying to create a culture of transparency and accountability, tracking KPIs alongside quota attainment is just as important. For me, personally, I like to track forecast accuracy, AE pipe gen, overall pipe gen, and close rate because they create a balance with each other, almost like a system of checks and balances, where if you name one, you get dinged on the other. What's number two? In addition to creating transparency, you have to also make sure you have a culture of constant learning, and that creates people feeling safe, being vulnerable, and talking about wins as well as losses. To have a dedicated Slack channel for closed lost, especially competitive losses, where you can make sure you're learning as much as possible from every loss. And so to create one where you post a loss when you've lost and compete, why did you lose? What did you learn? What could you have done differently? And creating public support around that. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. You know, I get 50 Slacks a day, and 48 are from Nick's closed lost deals. So what's number three? Number three in terms of how I think as a sales leader, it's important to to run the business so that you can scale it effectively is removing the word exception from your vocabulary. Exceptions might feel really good in the moment, but ultimately are the root of all email evil. And so when you're creating ROEs, rules of engagement, make sure you set them fairly, and then make sure you adhere to them completely and you don't create exceptions because that will ultimately breed a lack of trust. Alright, Eleanor. Let's start with that first one, which is you're measuring AEs mostly on the North Star, which is quota attainment, but you're looking at a couple of other metrics as it relates to measuring the performance of an AE. And this stuff is important to you. You were saying that, like, promotions are based on how people are doing with these things. So the four that you listed beyond just quota were forecast accuracy, AE pipe gen, overall pipe gen, and close rate. What I'd like to hear from you is, like, what are you actually looking at underneath forecast accuracy, and what does, like, a good metric for that actually So maybe you can go through the different the metrics and explain what's behind it and what good looks like. To zoom out a little bit, I think AEs are asked to do a ton all the time. They're asked to generate pipeline. They're asked to do renewals. They're asked to do, you know, internal presentations. They're asked to do syncs with their post sales counterparts. They're asked to close deals and manage accounts. And a lot of AEs will always say, I I'm doing too many things. How do I know what's most important? How do I know if I'm being measured? How do I basically have control over that? I find that it's really effective to create a lot of transparency and to be very clear. This is what we care about. This is how we're measuring it. This is why it matters. Here's how we're gonna talk about it. For each of these, they're really important in terms of all of the ingredients that go into being a good AE and enabling you as a leader to run your business effectively. Mhmm. An AE might not think forecast accuracy is that important, but as a leader, as a CRO, as a VP of sales, it's almost the most important thing because you have to show you have control over your business. Mhmm. And you're managing up to your CEO, to your board. And so the forecast accuracy piece, I think is really important because AEs will submit a call every week, and they might do it really quickly and not think about it. But if they know that that's gonna be tied to how they get promoted, how they're going to be performance managed, They're gonna think a lot more critically before they submit a call and a best case every week. Mhmm. And then you're going to feel a lot better using that information when you put together your call as a leader. Mhmm. So this could vary business to business. I think we set ours within 20% of accuracy for the trailing twelve weeks of the quarter because you are gonna learn more as the quarter progresses. So and we didn't wanna say, hey. Your first forecast is the only thing that matters. And so I think we did within 10 or 15% within your trailing twelve weeks where you with closest to the pin. Yeah. And then you always celebrate at the end who was closest to the pin all quarter, and you make that something that people are really proud to get right. And it gives you more control and the ability to run your business and have conviction delivering your forecast. Could you talk about how this stuff actually gets woven into performance reviews or quarterly check ins or whatever it is? Because I understand you have these four metrics, and then your manager reviews them weekly with the rep in the one on ones. Yep. Quarterly performance reviews come around. Are you looking at a week over week? This was your forecast accuracy every single week for the last twelve weeks. This was your quarterly win rate, things like that. How do you actually roll this up into a bigger picture feedback conversation with your reps? Yeah. So we actually grounded it. And first, we built out what are our competencies, how does that map to levels, and then what are our performance ratings that ladder up to the entire company, and how does that map to the KPIs? And then we build a decision tree. Okay. Did you hit x percent of your quota? Yes. Okay. Did you what did you do on these four KPIs? If yes, okay. Great. You'll do the successfully meets. Okay. Great. Yes. You'll did it in its seats expectations. Oh, you did all four and you blew out your number? Okay. Great. That's in greatly exceeds expectations. Then a rep knows going into a performance cycle, they have the stats app. They know what their quota attainment was, and they can look at that and know what performance rating they're going to get. Uh-huh. And they know that if they deliver on these four and against their revenue, that they will be eligible for a greatly exceeds expectations. And then we have promotion criteria. Hey. If you do this two quarters in a row, if you do this three quarters in a row, if you do this four quarters in a row, you'll be eligible to move to the next level. Then everyone is able to chart out their path. Here's how I get promoted. Mhmm. Here's how I did the performance rating they want. And here's how I'm tracking week over week so that I know if I'm performing against it and when you need to course correct. Let's dig deep into the iron square metric by metric. What are you looking for for a good win rate? And I'm also curious, what what type of time horizon are you using to properly report win rates? There's a lot of experimentation that goes into this. So when you first launch something like this, have an open mind because your initial hypothesis is probably going to be wrong. Mhmm. I think what we did is we set the win rate at stage two plus. We might have even done stage three plus to avoid a lot of tension over what's qualified or not. So I think we actually did a stage three plus win rate. We looked at the historics for the business. We looked at what top quartile looks like Mhmm. And set something somewhere in between. Like, we know this is what the business should do overall, and we know that this is excellent. So you, at a minimum, need to stay with the within the win rates of what we expect from the business. But then if you over perform that, that's something that can tie into getting an even better performance rating. So I believe we did stage three plus to avoid friction with what's qualified or not at stage two. Mhmm. And then we tied it to the historical numbers from the business for when we've had successful orders. How did you avoid having reps not put anything in the stage three unless they knew it was gonna close because that was impacting their promotions? You don't get an SE until you did something into stage three. So you have to move something in stage three in order to get access to your sales engineering resources. And, again, when this is all out in the open, when you're working on it every week with your manager, it's a lot harder to game the system. If you wanna get access to an SC, if you wanna run a POC, if you wanna be able to deliver the resources you need to win the deal, we gotta move things into stage three. How do you calculate win rates properly in sales? This is a rev ops question, because math always escapes me. And so I have no idea what goes into it behind the app, but we always end up arguing over some. And frequently, the reps are right, and we'll go back and and adjust them. Because it's tough. There's always gonna be noise. There's gonna be something that you inherited and ended up in your name Mhmm. And impacts your win rate. So you have to be flexible in terms of it'll drive a lot better Salesforce hygiene, though, I will say, if you know this is being tracked and it goes into your win rate. But there's gonna be some stuff that muddies it up, and you have to be willing to go in and sort of recalculate. I'll tell you the wrong way to do it is a lot of people will be like, great. All the opportunities that you've ever created divided by all the opportunities that you've ever won or the other way around. And the problem is you need to account for some seasoning in your opportunities. So, for example, if you created an opportunity yesterday and you lost an opportunity yesterday, that doesn't mean you have a 0% win rate. Yeah. Right? It literally means that some of your opportunities have not even had the chance to be won. And you need to think through how are you going to manage renewals. Like, what does a renewal op go into it? Expansions op should have a much higher win rate. So a lot of that goes into my amazing rev ops partners have always sort of thought through these things, but you have to do the pressure testing of how do we think about renewals? How do we think about expansions? Win rates on new business are always going to be lower. So thinking about how to set that win rate target and make sure that it takes all of that into account so that an AE feels comfortable losing something. Because a a world class win rate is still somewhere between, like, 2040%. Like, it isn't 90%. You know? You're not shooting for a 100%. There's you're going to lose more deals than you win. So one of the ways that you are incentivizing the right behaviors and incentivizing accuracy with these things is promotions are based off of the iron square. Access to resources like the SE are based off of the iron square, and you're also making this stuff public so the whole team can see. I get the point of, okay, this is being reviewed with manager and rep in a one on one. But, like, where does this live publicly? Are you putting in a Slack channel? Is it just the app and then anyone can go into it? It's in the app, and everyone's in there. And so it's all out in the open because none of this should be a secret. Like, everyone should be working together. Everyone should be learning from each other. Competition is healthy. Your best reps are always gonna wanna be number one. Yeah. You wanna motivate that. Those people are amazing and do have an outsized impact on your business. And so part of that is creating an environment where it's okay to be competitive as long as you're collaborative and it's healthy. And one thing to to to get on the forecast accuracy and win rate in particular create a healthy balance Mhmm. Because you can't just create fake pipeline and then call it if you know your win rate's gonna be off. It's all designed that they sort of counterbalance the other so that you don't create fake pipeline if you know you're not gonna close it. And you don't wanna have a really low win rate because you have all this pipeline that isn't real. So it's it's not a perfect system by any means. I would argue it's, like, 70% Yeah. Effective. And we something that you need to keep fine tuning quarter over quarter, performance cycle over performance cycle. But the goal is that they balance each other so that you gain the system as little as possible. Yeah. The checks and balances are really important. You were talking to me on the prep call about the overall pipe gen metric as well as the AE pipe gen metric. So talk to me about why you have those separated and what goes into those two. PG is everyone's responsibility, and AE source pipeline is incredibly important. But one of the biggest tensions that exist in any b to b SaaS business is the BDR and the AE and is something qualified and who got the attribution and should the attribution have gone to marketing Mhmm. Or should it have gone to the BDR or was it actually inbound? Is it it with someone else from the company who requested the demo? When you spend all of your time litigating these things, that's time you're not spent selling. Yeah. And so we wanted to include both because AEs should be generating their own pipeline. It should be something like 25 or 30 is what I've always done of their pipeline should be from them, but they should also be motivated to partner really well with their BDR and to make their BDR successful. They should be motivated to partner really well with marketing, follow-up on every event lead. Even if that event lead goes to marketing for attribution, that's still pipeline for them. And they should still be, you know, you hear this all the time, the CEO of their own business. And part of that is you own your own pipeline generation, but also you own the rest of it because that's not just the BDR's number or marketing's number. That's your number too, and you need to feel like an owner of both. You keep it simple. You tell them what metrics you're gonna track. You don't make it a million metrics. You put it in one place, and you put it in a place where every single person on the team is constantly looking at it. When I was running the sales development team over at Carta, for SDRs, it was really simple. We had a three column dashboard, month, week, day. And it was just number of cold calls, connect rate, set rate, number of emails, open rate, reply rate. Meetings booked from each channel. And you could literally see it stack ranked by rep. Yep. And every single week in the Monday morning meeting, that's what we looked at. How many meetings did you book? How effective were your calls? How effective were your emails? And your team starts to get addicted to those things and optimizing those metrics when they see all of those things on the leaderboard every single day versus a lot of times teams by quarter, by convenience, will change the metric that's important to them. This quarter, it's stage one to stage two. Next quarter, it's stage three to stage four. Next quarter, it's average ACV. And the problem is every single time you do that, it throws off your reps' rhythm for what is important. And to me, those short term things, that's what spiffs are for. Yeah. So if you wanna do some short term behavior change, like, okay, we're gonna really focus on stage two to stage three and getting something to a POC. Do a quarter specific contest and a spiff for that. But no give folks clarity and confidence that those four KPIs and quota attainment Yeah. Aren't going to change. Because no matter what happens, those four are gonna be important. And that's why those are the foundational ones that are tied to performance management and to promotions, and those don't change. But priorities of the business are gonna change, and that's to me what spiffs are for. So how do you teach your managers to problem solve off of this stuff? Let's say, for example, I see one rep who has a 15% win rate, and the next rep has a 25 win rate. How does a manager start to diagnose what's going on? Honestly, I feel like they teach me about that too. And I also think by making it transparent, the reps can help themselves. So they can look and they can see this person's win rate is a lot better than mine. And a really good rep is gonna go listen to their gongs and is gonna go understand what they're doing differently. They're gonna go look through their Salesforce. They're gonna talk to them. They're gonna talk to their SE. They're gonna look in their deal channels. Mhmm. They're gonna read their deal review notes, and they're gonna see, okay, these are some areas where I can improve. And then otherwise, it does create a good playbook for the managers to say, hey. This is where you're underperforming relative to your peers. Let's talk about why. Like, are you qualifying deals that shouldn't be qualified? Are you stuck with a low level champion because you've never gotten to the EB? Are you working on something that isn't that important to the company and spending cycles on it? Are you trying to close a deal for enterprise that should definitely be a self-service deal? And rather than qualifying it out early Mhmm. You're spending an entire three month POC and cycle on it in order to lose to the self-service business, which is often what it is. Yeah. At least in my experience of the companies I've been at. But it creates areas for the managers to focus and to diagnose where the issues are too. Again, on those four core KPIs that never change. Armand, how would you do this as a VP of sales as it relates to teaching your managers how to diagnose problems? I wanna echo what Eleanor said around the best teams teach the reps how to self diagnose issues. Yep. And the managers give sense checks. Yep. So I'll go back to the SDR example, and then I'll give you an AE example because SDR is a little bit simpler. I'm coaching this awesome SDR named McKenna right now. She's one of my advisory clients. Mhmm. And her meetings went down from four to two last week. If this was eight weeks ago when we first started working together, she would have said, why'd my meetings go down? Mhmm. I don't know. She came to the meeting. She's like, okay. My emails were constant. My open rate was constant. My reply rate was constant. I got two meetings from emails. I didn't get any meetings from cold calls. Okay? My cold calls were constant, and so it's either my connect rate or my set rate. She looked at both of them. She's like, I have an issue with my connect rate. I'm like, awesome. Let's talk about ways to boost your connect rate. To me, that's an awesome rep doing self diagnosis. Mhmm. And so what you do is you won't you don't wanna get into metrics overload. Yep. But you wanna teach people sort of one layer down the decision tree. So, for example, if I'm taking revenue, one layer down the decision tree is, do you have enough pipeline? Mhmm. Are you winning that pipeline? And then you have how big are the average deals and time to close. Yeah. Right? So you can usually deduce most of the metrics from one of those four. From there, let's say win rates are an issue. You really wanna understand where the win rates are starting to fall apart. And that's when you start to look at things like stage by stage conversion. Personally, that is as far as I like to go on the metrics side. Like, anything more like doing all these crazy close loss analysis by rep, I find it gets really muddy. From that point on, that's when I'm, like, actually coaching the calls or I'm asking the managers, go dig in on their last five first discovery calls because they have a stage one to stage two issue. And that's how you actually, like, unpack from metrics quantitative to the qualitative stuff you should be coaching, my experience. The other piece of what I really liked about the McKenna example is it's very easy in sales to say, well, it's not my fault. Like, no one's picking up cold calls right now. Or, you know, this a desogenous thing is happening. Like, it can feel so much like everything happens to you where when you create an environment like that, you can help people realize how much is in their control Mhmm. And to help them take control over it. And so they move from their mindset of I'm gonna blame everyone around me to I'm actually in control of my own destiny. And you're better when you feel in control and giving them people that visibility, the tools to self diagnose, the tools to get better, the visibility to see how it gets better is such a virtuous cycle of creating a culture of ownership Yeah. And of not blaming things around you. And that creates better, healthier reps as well. Yeah. I mean, it's really hard to be focusing on your locus of control and problem solving if you are massively distracted over litigating who gets credit for an inbound lead that an AE was prospecting and an SDR was also a quarter ago. You have a really, really specific approach to rules of engagement, also called ROEs. Talk to me about what that is. It goes back to what I was saying earlier about how there is a ton that's outside of your control. You're going to lose more than you win. It's a really hard job. You're told no a lot. Your success depends on a lot of other people. You win as a team, you lose as a team. Half of your salary is at risk all the time. Mhmm. Every 90, the clock resets and suddenly you're back to zero. Like, emotionally managing all of that is really hard. Mhmm. And a key part of showing up every day as a rep and doing your best work is trusting your leadership and trusting that your leadership will be fair Mhmm. And trusting that you understand how they make decisions, trusting that they have your back, but they don't have someone else's back more than they have your back. Like, all of that really matters in order to wait up every morning and start generating pipeline and trying to close deals. And so to me, consistency in leadership and decision making is a key part of that. And it's a lot harder than it sounds very specifically. And I've you know, everyone has to learn this the hard way. Like, I don't think there's any way to get into sales leadership and not make a ton of mistakes around this. But when you set rules of engagement at the beginning of the year or in planning, you set them with rev ops, you set them with all of the leadership's teams, you all, you know, hold hands and agree on them. I believe in no exceptions. No matter how tempting it is or how complicated it is or how emotional it is, you follow the rules of engagement. So let's talk about the common buckets of ROEs. Looking at it, I I see them falling into three different categories. The first is who is allowed to work what? That includes regional territories, employee counts, segment lines, things like that. Number two is what happens when something changes hands? So you have territories changing hands, opportunity holdovers, SDR to AE handoffs, AE to AM handoffs, etcetera. And then the last bucket that I had is a little bit more associated with the world of, like, the AE to SDR stuff in terms of, like, what's qualified, what considers, a point in the round robin versus not, what do you do if an AE AE gets a demo request that no shows, do they get a credit back? So I know those aren't the perfect buckets, but why don't we start with the first one? When you think about who is allowed to work what accounts, what are some of the baseline rules you need to set as a sales leader? I think there's a few gosh. Even that one bucket is so many different buckets because the ROEs are so messy. So, again, it depends on the size and nature of your business. Mhmm. But as you move beyond your first two or three reps, you'll probably start to draw some segmentation lines. These reps will work zero to 100 employees. These reps will work 100 to a thousand. These reps will work 1,000 plus. Mhmm. Those will change year over year, again, as your business moves up market and expands. So that's one. Again, as you move internationally, suddenly, it's gonna be, okay, this is where is this headquartered? Mhmm. And then there's complexities around. If it's headquartered here, but everyone's over here, but the buy note is over here, you have to have an objective way to set that. So I think the two most important ones are segment lines. Mhmm. And then what are you going to use as your objective criteria for who can work it and where it is? We use shipping HQ in Salesforce. If it's different in LinkedIn, if it's different on their s one, if it's different on Wikipedia, we don't care. Even if it's inaccurate, it has to be consistent or else people are going to spend all of their time putting together a presentation on why it should move into a different territory. Shipping HQ, LinkedIn, you use that every time. You know it's not gonna be accurate all the time Yeah. But it's gonna be the same. You're focused on consistency more than accuracy 100% of the time. You'd rather be consistent 100% of the time than accurate 100% of the time. Exactly. How often are you revisiting these data refreshes? Is it annually, quarterly, otherwise? The data's refreshed. It depends where your sources are. Yeah. But I think we we try and keep the data refreshed constantly. So and it matters at at the moment of time. So when the demo is request, what does the the data say on that day? So you have to say, on this day, this is the source of the data, but you always keep your data up to date. So this would drive me crazy. Extremely triggering. When I was at Carta, the way that we would price was based on the number of investors you had on your cap table, which would include everyone who invested in your company and all of the employees who also held options. The closest thing to reporting on that is your employee count. Yep. But, technically, there can be a difference. So, for example, if you have, like, 30 employees, you might actually have, like, 60 stakeholders on your cap table Yep. Because people have left the company, exercised their options, you have investors. Where it's not FTEs. They have a ton of contractors. Do you count the dashers for DoorDash? Like, what do you use as your data source for that? So my question for you is we had so many disputes because the SMB territory line at Carta was tiny. It was one to 25 employees. But if someone had 30 stakeholders, you could make a protest that that should be a mid market deal. So you'd get a 20 employee count with 31 investors, and you'd have to pass it up to the next segment. And so there were probably four, five, six deals being passed every single day. And it's not only bad from a customer experience, it also just creates a ton of infighting. So you had a similar type of issue, I think, at segment and probably at retool. I think you can have that issue anywhere. It's just exacerbated at different levels. But, I mean, I've definitely had that issue all the time. And then what do you happen if the employee count changes mid deal cycle? Do you have to pass it up? Or and so you have to set rules around all of that. Mhmm. But this is where working with rev ops and poking holes from the beginning and and doing a lot of role playing. Okay. If x, y, and z happens, what will we do? If x, y, and z happens, what do we do? We include a lot of examples in our ROE. So we can say, before you even come to us with something is the example in the ROE. So our ROEs in Confluence are very long and very detailed and very scenario oriented because you can sort of game out what the issues are gonna be. Yeah. And, again, if what you're optimizing for is consistency versus I mean, accuracy is obviously very Of course. Important. Right. But I actually would argue consistency is more important because you want to create something that's objective, transparent, and feels fair. Mhmm. Because if it feels fair, you know they're gonna break your way the same number of times they're gonna break against you. And I think if you aren't consistent, it might break against you more often than not. That's gonna make someone really unhappy and then be really demotivating. And so if the goal is to keep everyone motivated, it needs to be fair. You need to do what you say you're gonna do, and it needs to be consistent. Could you give an example rule for how you would draw segment lines? And if you find that the actual pricing metric is really different from the segment lines, like, what's the rule around that? For us, the examples are it's whatever it is when you get the deal and when you qualify it. And so if it's a zero to 100 employees and it's 99 employees Mhmm. When it comes inbound, it goes to stage two. You're working it. It stays with you even if they grow to, 200 or 300 employees during the course of the deal. Once it's closed lost and, again, this is where you have to have accountability and the manager making sure it's real and you're not just holding on to it. Mhmm. Once it closed lost, it'll then move to mid market. When it goes back into the account pool or moves into, you know, refreshed territories, it'll move to mid market. But once you've qualified it, it's yours till it's closed won or closed lost. And what do you do when the rep has the magically shrinking territory? Oh, you just deal with it. You know, it always happens. There's no there's no a 100%. You're gonna end up Mhmm. With splits. It's why you try and cover as much as you can with ROEs. You're gonna end up in messy situations, so you try and cover as much as you can, and you make it very clear that you won't do it. Deceptions. When you end up in a situation where it's not covered by the ROEs, you gotta work from first principles and try and figure out the right way to do it. But if people know that 90% of the time, it'll be covered by the ROEs and that you will not make an exception no matter what, they'll also stop coming to you and asking for an exception because they know that the answer will be no. Yeah. And then you'll reduce the time people spend on putting together their business taste for why it should stay with one team versus the other, and they'll spend that time outbounding and selling. And you'll get people what I love is I feel like the team at Retul got so accustomed to the ROEs and what they were that they would self report. And they would say, hey. This thing moved into my name. I don't think it should have rather than have a big argument in two months. Should we move it to the right person now? As it relates to who can work what, Armand, you led the sales team at Pave for a long time. Eleanor, you've led a number of different sales organizations. Can you just both share maybe how you, like where the what lines you drew from a territory perspective, both in terms of, like, the segment lines? It sounds like for you, it might have been employee count as well as, like, geos just so people can understand this. Because I've heard so many different ways of, like, people assigning territories alphabetically instead of geo geographically. Or, like, I had attorney count when I was selling to law firms. It was based on the number of attorneys, and there were lots of different variables in there. So I think it would be good for folks just to hear, like, how you two chose to draw those lines in your leadership positions. Mine has always been, employee count, and then that can change because you might resegment year over year, and then you figure out holdovers and how to manage that. Mhmm. I've done geos internationally. We've done some geos domestically. I find geos are more relevant internationally than they are in The US, especially with the way people buy today. Yeah. And then we used to do full account pool and round robin. And, again, this changes as the sales org matures, but then we actually moved into a named account model. So you have your territory at the beginning of the year, your named accounts. No matter what happens Mhmm. If they move their HQ, if they move their employee line, those are your accounts till the end of the year. Mhmm. And then we'll still distribute the inbound via round robin. Those are the ones where if you close lost and they can move to a different territory, but your territory in the beginning of the year is your territory. Mhmm. And that also plays into we're do what we say we're gonna do. We're gonna give you these accounts, and we're not gonna thrash you midyear. Those are gonna be your accounts till the end of the year, and you know that so you can build out a plan and work them. Very similar. My goal is to minimize handoffs between reps and not create a jarring experience for the customer. Mhmm. And so what that meant is we would establish what accounts were commercial, mid market, and enterprise based on employee count. Mhmm. So one to two fifty was commercial. Two fifty to a thousand was mid market. A thousand plus was enterprise. And then, eventually, we had strategic. Because we didn't do much SMB selling, even for our commercial reps, we were able to carve out books where we got most of the TAM covered. Interesting. And that was your book for the year. And then there was a pool of accounts that were named and stamped commercial where mid market reps literally could not pick them up. And same thing with enterprise. And then we would continuously refresh the data, but we wouldn't continuously restamp the account so you didn't have this constant moving across segments. It wasn't perfect, but my goal was so that when we carve territories with a plan, if a company grew by 30 employees over two quarters, to me, like, there's not such a radical difference that you should take that from one rep and put it in another rep's hands. How did the two of you approach holdover period? So the year ends, I now have a new book, territories are changing, but I've got a really big deal. I've worked for a long time. Like, it's just on the cusp. You know we're inactive red lines maybe. Like, what was your approach, Eleanor? I have another rule that I use for ROEs and for territory setting and for anything is your internal processes should never impact the customer experience. And so when you're trying to make a decision about something or how do we wanna run this, like, our internal problems are not their problem. So our internal processes I asked to use it a lot with finance when they're like, well, we need x y and z from the customer. Yeah. Our internal processes Yeah. Should never impact the customer experience. For holdouts, we had the same rule from the beginning. When territories change over Mhmm. Anything you have that's stage two plus, you get to hold out for an extra quarter. Yeah. And that's been our holdout rules for everything. How about you? It was open opportunities Mhmm. But there was a limit on how many you could have. That should honestly be countered by managers should be doing better inspection, but there's a little bit of a conflict of interest. Because manager wants their rep to have the deal. Right? Exactly. So let's say, for example, reps know at the beginning of the year, the territories are gonna be carved. Mhmm. What are they gonna do? I had a meeting with the prospect. Yeah. I'm gonna create the opportunity, maybe move it to stage two, whatever it is. If they know they're being measured on their win rate Mhmm. They're not gonna wanna keep something that might be not a real deal Yep. That they can't close in the next three months because then it'll move out of their name, and it'll be in their win rate. So a lot of it is how do you balance that behavior too? Because, you know, they'll just wanna move everything into stage two and keep it, but actually doesn't make any sense if it'll make their artificially depress their win rate. The goal is to never disrupt pipeline. Yep. If something's actually in pipeline Mhmm. I want a rep to see that through. A 100%. That said I also wanna pay the person who did the work. Correct. Like, if you did the work, you should be the one who gets paid. Exactly. Where it starts to get messy is when you try to move territories to change your business strategy, to change your sales strategy, to give new reps a shot. And 90% of the best accounts are in holdover. Yeah. And so it's like the caste system where, like, all of the new reps have to work their way up through the worst possible books Mhmm. Because you have the most generous holdover period. I find that you you have to be fair and inspect the heck out of what's really in pipeline Yeah. And limit the number of holdovers a rep can have. And And if someone has, like, 40 or 50 holdovers, as the VP of sales, you go in and you dig in on those things to make sure the manager isn't messing around. Alrighty, Eleanor. We talked about a lot of good habits when it comes to metrics, ROEs, and all these other things. I think I know where you're gonna go with this, but we have to talk about a bad habit. So what is one bad habit? Oh, there's so many. I mean Let me finish. What is one bad habit that every leader should break so that all teams get better? Making an exception is really tempting, and you're still going to do it even if you say that you never will. So just try and do it as little as possible and put no exceptions on a Post it on your calendar. Mhmm. Like, put it on your desktop. Make sure you're looking at it every day because when someone whose success you care deeply about comes to you with an extraordinarily rational ask, every part of you will want to say yes. It'll feel really dead in the moment, and then it'll feel really bad a week or two later because it'll always come back and haunt you. Just holding true to that, if it's in the ROE, we have to honor the ROE. Amazing show, Eleanor. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, folks. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Eleanor Dorfman. Nick, what do you have for your two? So my first one is if you are looking to make short term behavior changes, that is what a SPIFF is for. Long term behavior changes come from your iron square of what you measure folks against. So that's my first one. The second one was Eleanor's approach to holdovers on accounts where if territories change, but you have an open opportunity. Her rule is that you get one additional quarter to close that deal if it is past stage two. Beyond that, there are zero, and I mean zero exceptions. The way that she thinks about the no exceptions rule is sometimes it's gonna go your way as an AE. Sometimes it won't, but she would rather be consistent than try to tweak every deal and have people put together business cases and litigate exceptions. Number three, the iron square for rep productivity. Mhmm. You have win rate, AE source pipeline, pipeline generation overall, and forecast accuracy. And then in the center, you have the north star, which is quota attainment. And then lastly, number four, your internal nonsensical processes should not impact the customer experience. If you have a segment line that is off by one employee, make sure that there is enough buffer built into your territories and your ROEs so you're not constantly passing deals and making your customers feel the exchange of reps deals between different hands. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? So a lot of what Eleanor talks about in her ROEs is stage based. And we sat down with Mark Casaglow, and we documented his five step sales process and the different stages that go into this. If you don't have really, really consistent and clear definitions of what constitutes stage two versus stage three versus stage four, you are going to run into a lot of headache and hassle. And so we've got a link in the show notes on this one to go check out that newsletter we did with Mark. Give it a read. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes to President's Club.
