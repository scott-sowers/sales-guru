## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have one of the greatest guests we've ever seen of all time. He's a negotiation machine. He is a cheap bastard. He's bought a lot of software, and he's taught a lot of people how to negotiate deals. It is me. Yeah, folks. Well, we had a guest cancel, admittedly, and so Nick and I decided to do a special mini playbook featuring yours truly on all things negotiation. If you're watching on YouTube, you might see my empty wallet, and you don't want an empty wallet. You want a full wallet. And aside from your ability to prospect, run great discovery calls, run a great deal, negotiating is the biggest place that salespeople take their cash and throw it in the trash. We don't want you to do that. We want you to keep your hard earned commission check. And so my good friend, Arman, is going to teach you how you should be presenting price, what you should do step by step to navigate a negotiation so that you don't go back and forth and back and forth and bleed a million different cuts and die, and how you can ultimately get your deal closed on a timeline that gets you paid and not, maybe in a quarter. Alright. Armand, welcome to the show. You might not be aware, but we do start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Well, folks, I am a cheap bastard. So today, I'm teaching you to negotiate. Number one, create a cost to everything in a negotiation. If you ask for a discount, I'm gonna ask for timeline. If you ask for more seats, I'm gonna ask for a three year deal. The reason for this is if I give you something for free, you're gonna assume you can get another thing. And so every time you ask for something, I create a cost to it so I get something in return, and eventually, you stop asking for things. I'm worried you're gonna ask me for something in return here, but what's number two? Number two, fake walk when they're asking for too much. There's gonna be a point at which even when you start asking for things in return, someone's gonna ask you for a 70% discount. And you can't say, oh, you want a 70% discount? Can I have a fifty year deal in return? So you have to fake walk. So what I'll say is, Nick, if you ask me for a 70% discount, I'm gonna say, Nick, I'm gonna be completely honest. I might have screwed up here, but this probably means that we're not a fit. And I didn't do a good enough job of selling the value of what we brought to the table. I know we're so far off that it probably doesn't even make sense for me to go back to my CFO and ask for anything. I I just wanna confirm that you're okay with that too so that I'm not messing something up here. And what you do is you force them to take a step forward and say, no. No. No. No. I'm willing to work with you guys or no. No. No. At least do your best. And that means that they don't actually need a 70% discount. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Very nice. What's number three? Number three. Negotiate like a grandma. So, eventually, toward the end of a negotiation, let's say you've settled on a 10% discount, a 15% discount. What you wanna do is you wanna switch the negotiation bucket. When a grandma goes to the grocery store, she starts paying in $5 bills. And if she has a $30 grocery bill, she might only have $20 in cash. So then she starts pulling out change, and maybe she scrapes together another $5 in change. And then she gets to the last five dollars, and she goes, well, Nick, do you accept checks? And that's what you wanna do with your negotiation because eventually, the cashier is just like, take the $5 for free. Alright. Just go on with your apples, and let me take on the next customer. And so once someone has gotten enough ARR discount, the next thing you say is like, look. I don't know if I can do anything more here. Can I work with you on billing terms? Or if you're running out of billing terms, you might say, like, maybe I can ask my finance team for net 45 instead of net 30, and they will start to realize that you are tapped out on discounts. Great. So other than hunting in my couch cushions for loose change to take to my friendly neighborhood Erewhon, I am assuming there is some degree of prep that you're doing before you walk into a meeting with a customer where you're gonna be delivering price or you anticipate some degree of negotiation. Talk to me about what happens prior. So the number one thing that you need to understand is what is your best alternative to a negotiated agreement? So I used to sell equity management software at a company called Carta. And here's an example where I know I have really high leverage in a deal. Every twelve months, a startup needs to get a valuation on their stock options. If someone is at month eleven, I know they pretty much have to buy something in a month. And if I know I'm vendor of choice, I know it's pretty likely that they're gonna buy something from me. So I probably am not gonna discount very much, especially if I know I'm the only competitor in the deal. Conversely, if they're at month three, they don't need another valuation for nine months. They're not issuing a bunch of stock options, and there are four other competitors who are coming in at half the price, I know I'm probably going to have to work with them on price because I'm either going to lose the deal to a competitor or I'm gonna lose the deal to the status quo. Great. And so let's say you've gone through that exercise. Right? You know where they're at in terms of how far away they are from needing to make a decision, how big that problem is. How is that actually informing what you do? Yeah. The number one rep that I ever coached, her name is Morgan Mello. She would oftentimes bring me in for a negotiation. And she would tell me, Armand, here are their alternatives. Here are the competitors in the deal. Are we vendor of choice? Do they need to do something? Do they need to do something now? And then she would say, I don't think you need to discount this deal, but I want you to just come in and be the bad guy so I can maintain goodwill with my champion. So I will often know where I can land or where I will need to land before a negotiation starts. That's number one, is your first form of intel is your best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Your second form of intel that will tell you how much you need to negotiate is do not look at their eyes or listen to what they're saying. Look at their feet. If you know this is a business priority, if you know power's eyes are on the deal, if you know your champion and the executive want this thing, and now procurement's asking you for a discount, their feet are moving forward in the purchase. The procurement's mouth is moving and asking for a 30% discount, but I know it won't matter. So I'm making that decision before the negotiation. And then lastly, number three is I have my BATNA. I have their feet, and then I have the intel that the champion is telling me. So if you did a good job of building relationship with your champion, you can oftentimes ask your champion. I will literally say before going into procurement, I'll be like, hey. You've seen deals blow up at the finish line with procurement, and oftentimes, you know if they need to get their pound of flesh. When you've bought things in the past, what are they typically asking you for in that negotiation? And now I can get a sense of how much meat I might need to put on the bone or even pad my quote with so that procurement feels like they gotta win. So those are your three forms of intel, and that should tell you how much you think you need to discount before you get into the negotiation. There's a period before the champions on your side where, like, they might be negotiating with you, or maybe their boss might be negotiating with you. And I think the foundation here probably starts with, like, how you tee up and present price in the first place. And I know you're doing some really intentional things when you're first putting that number in front of the customer. And I'm not talking about, like, really early on in a discovery call where you might give them a wide range just so they know directionally where you're at. I'm talking when you put that proposal with the real price in front of them. Talk to me about how that should go. So there are a couple of things that need to happen before you give the number. The first thing you need to do is you need to validate problem. In other words, the first slide that I'm giving when I'm giving pricing is always these are the four problems that you said you wanted to solve, and then these are the four ways that we can solve it. Are we generally aligned that this is something that we would want independent of price? If there are competitors in the deal, I will oftentimes say, hey. There are these three other people who you are evaluating. And so far, what you've told me is that we are the best fit for you all independent of price. How long do you actually spend going through that? Because I learned that from you, and I've been on calls where I felt like I spent way too much time building up the problem, building up the issues. I'm curious if you think about a thirty minute proposal call meeting, how you allocate your time in that meeting. This should not have been the first time you've done this. There might be new people in the room or this might but just be a recap for power. At the end of the discovery call, you're oftentimes getting problem validation. At the end of the demo call, you're oftentimes getting solution validation. At the end of the big team demo, you're oftentimes getting, hey. We're vendor of choice. And then at the beginning of the proposal call, you're just recapping the three or four things that you've learned in the last call, and you're saying, hey. Just confirming. Are we all on the same page? Do we wanna work together? Are we actually vendor of choice? Great. If you haven't gotten that at this point, then I would honestly ask yourself, are you really at the point where you need to be walking them through a full proposal? Because that means you're not even at problem agreement yet. You get to the point when you give price. Talk to me about how that goes. So the first thing that you need to validate is problem agreement and vendor of choice. The second thing that you need to validate is process agreement. And so the way that you validate process agreement is you say, let's just pretend. And you oftentimes do this again before the proposal call. So you oftentimes have a prep call with your champion talking about, okay. What do you need to ultimately make a purchasing decision? They'll say a proposal, and you'll use let's just pretend language. And so you'll say, hey, Nick. I'm really excited that we seem like the vendor of choice. Let's just pretend that this conversation goes well. I wanna make sure that we're meeting all of your go live timelines and that if we have a price that actually works for you guys, if the contract looks the way that you want it to look, that we actually have a way to move forward together and navigate all the other boxes that you need to check off in the organization. So you mentioned that the three things that need to happen next are we need to get executive approval, we need to get finance approval, and then we need to do legal and security. This is how long each of those things will take if this next conversation goes well. Does that look about right? And all you're doing on the proposal call is you're recapping that thing that you've already done before. So this should not be the first time you've discussed process. This should have happened earlier in your sales cycle. And so all you're saying is, like, okay. Assuming this goes well, here were the timelines, the high level buckets that we discussed. Are we still all on the same page? You now have process alignment. Now you need to give a number. Not yet. A third thing. The last thing you need is you need pricing structure alignment. And so this is when you start to give the number, is you start to explain everything else that is required to explain price. You explain price before you give the number. So I'm going to tell you things like, well, Nick, it's gonna take us this long to implement, so there will be an implementation fee. We price based on the number of seats and the products that you want. Our contracts typically go for this long. I'm gonna explain all of the mechanics around how our pricing works before I give you the number. And then I'm gonna give you the number and shut up. After you give the price, do not speak a word. He or she who speaks first loses. So the way that actually sounds is I might say like, look, Nick. The way that we price is based on the number of seats that you ultimately buy and then based on the different products that you have. If I was at Pave, I would say, sounds like you want the total rewards platform and the compensation planner, And it sounds like you're currently at a thousand employees, and you're gonna grow to 1,500 throughout the year. So we have you in the 1,000 to 1,500 bucket for the full suite platform. Do I have that right? You say yes. Awesome. So the full suite price for 1,500 employees is a $100,000 per year. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Now it's very rare that prospects say, great. Sign me up. Here's my AmEx. Usually, a smart buyer is going to know that their first reaction should be a bit of pushback. And so when you get that negative reaction from the customer, you don't know if that's real or fake, but I think you still respond the same way. So let's say the customer hits you with, oh, wow. It's actually a bit higher than we expected. Or, you know, we've been looking at some other quotes. That seems kinda high. Oh, what's your response when you get some pushback or resistance on pricing? What most sellers do is they start to stammer, sweat, or the other person goes silent, and they start to jump in and say, but we can work on it. We really want you to be a customer. If someone is acting surprised about pricing, you need to act surprised in return. And so if you say, woah. That was wild. Like, I was way more expensive than I thought it was gonna be. I'm gonna say, like, oh, well well, Nick, I feel like I might have messed something up here because look. We're never the cheapest, but we're never totally out of the realm of possibility. And so this might have been on me because maybe I wasn't transparent around our pricing, or maybe I gave you the impression that we were a cheaper product. And so I'm putting it back on them. I wanna understand, do you actually have a sense of how much this thing could cost, or are you just asking me for a discount? You're gonna give me one of two answers. You're gonna say, well, I thought it was gonna be cheaper, or you're gonna give me a real answer, and you're gonna say, well, your three competitors cost this much, and, honestly, you're three x the cost. And based on if they give me just the BS, I want cheaper versus the competitor answer, I can take it either which way. Great. So they say, I want it cheaper. Like, I didn't think it was gonna be this. And they're not gonna say it that way. They're gonna say, yeah. I didn't think this thing was gonna be $80 a year. Gosh. There's no way we're gonna get that approved. Totally. So if they say, I never thought this was gonna be $80. The The first thing you can do is you can use a Chris Voss label. And you can say, like, okay. Sounds like we might not be bringing enough value to actually justify the price. Or it sounds like we're not even worth anything close to that $80? Or it sounds like we're a million miles apart. Is it literally if we weren't to come in at 20 k? Or, I guess, what did you have in mind? And so I still didn't get a number from you. And so what I wanna do is I'm pushing for the number that isn't 80 k. Another form of language that I like to use, I'm gonna say, well I mean, Nick, it's it's sort of hard for me to know, like, how far off we are. There has to be a number between $0 and 80 k that you did have in mind. I guess, like, what what did you have in mind? Because I I I don't even know how far off we are. I need to get them to take a step forward because, otherwise, I'm just negotiating against myself. Now if they give me competitors, I might do something a little bit different. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna push you away into the competitor. You might say your other competitors are charging 40 k. I'm gonna say, Nick, I I I know those competitors. Right? To my understanding, we were bringing things to the table that I I knew you would value above and beyond what those folks brought. I guess if they're offering everything that you need at half the price, I know I'm not gonna be able to meet them at half the price. I I guess why wouldn't you go with someone like SalesGoon? And so I'm gonna push them away to the competition so they start to push back into me. Either way, the next action that happens in both of these scenarios is they take a step forward. I'm sure there's salespeople that hear that, and that's giving them acid reflux. The idea of saying, oh, you should go with a competitor instead of us. What would you say to those salespeople that are really afraid to push the customer in the direction of your biggest competitor? So the first thing is the reason that we validate that we are vendor of choice first. The definition of vendor of choice means you are the vendor that they would like to purchase, which means that if everyone else was priced at $1 and you were priced at $1.01, then that means they will probably still go with you, unless you are literally not worth a penny more of value. And so I'm not saying you should just tell them to go to the competitor. But the reason you push them into the $1 solution is what you're waiting for them to say is, look, I I do wanna go with you. I'm just not willing to pay double the price, and that naturally begs the question. Okay. Then it's just a matter of us figuring out what is the additional value that we're bringing above the competition By pushing them into the rock bottom competitors that you know they don't want, they're gonna push back into you. And now we say, okay. So then it's just a matter of figuring out how much more value we bring over 40 k that will determine where we ultimately land. If that value is not enough, you may need to move a bid on price, but we need to get back to exploring that gap between the second tier and you, the first tier, first because you need some information to determine how you're going to move things around in order to get there. And so from here, what happens is you get the prospect to say, no. No. No. No. You're worth a little bit more than the competition. Or no. No. No. No. I believe that you're bringing some value to the table. I just don't believe you're bringing $80 of value. Awesome. So now we just need to match price and value. But first, this is not the full ask. So once I get them to take a step forward, I want all of the steps forward. So, Nick, you believe that 80 k is too expensive. I'm telling you that 40 k is obviously what we're not going to come down to. There's some amount between 40 and 80 that's gonna be the right number. But the reality is this probably isn't the only thing you're gonna ask for me because we're talking about an 80 k purchase. I get to do all of this stuff in one cut with my CFO. So I need you to tell me, are you gonna come and ask for things like billing terms? Are you gonna come and ask for things like rate locks? Are you gonna come and ask for things like access to all future products? Whatever the most common asks that you know they're gonna ask for anyway, bring those up now. You want to get the full ask on the table. And the reason for that is once you get the what else? What else? What else? Full ask. Now you can use options to force trade offs to get the final ask. So let's just pretend, Nick, that you say, well, look. I I know our finance team is gonna want 60. I'm gonna run the same thing again. Net 60? You want net 60? I was like, jeez. Every customer I've ever sold, they want net 15. And I'm fighting you like a dog on every single thing you bring to the table. Even if it doesn't matter to me, I'm fighting you like a dog. I wanna stay in this fight for a solid ten minutes. You give me another thing on the table, I'm gonna do the fake walk that I mentioned upfront. I'm gonna say, shoot, Nick. Is it even worth me bringing anything to my CFO? And they're gonna say, like, no. No. No. Look. I I can work on all of these things, but but the price is most important. Maybe I can concede on the billing terms. And so every single time you create a little bit of fight, you're getting them to come an inch forward. You wanna start to create a cost to everything in negotiation. You wanna start removing value in exchange for price. So every time they ask for something more, I'm gonna ask for something in return. So you ask me for more seats. I'm gonna say, like, Nick, I need a three year deal. You start asking me for a 40% discount. I'm gonna be like, Nick, I I guess you don't really need the total rewards portal. Maybe we can remove that. So every time you ask for something, I'm making it really, really painful until I feel like I've tenderized you, tenderized the meat of the negotiation enough that I know if I give you a current options, you're so worn out from the negotiation that you're gonna pick one of the options because you know you're not gonna get much more out of me. What you're doing that was small, you mentioned, but I think it's worth repeating is you are saying, hey. I'm gonna have to go back to my CFO and get this approved. And I only get one cut with them. And what you're doing here is you're actually removing yourself, Armand, from being the person in control and power in the negotiation. And that's actually something Chris Watts talks about also where he's like, hey. You don't want them to know that you might be in control. You're saying, I gotta go to my CFO. I gotta go to my executive team. And what this allows you to do then is ask, ask, ask, ask, get all of their asks on the table. You're doing some negotiation discovery. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. So let's fast forward a bit here, Armand, and assume you've gotten all of their asks and requirements out on the table, and you've come to a place where what they are asking for, you're like, in your mind, I know we can do that. Now you're telling them you gotta go back to your CFO, but you know from your perspective that deal can get done. Customer feels good. Everything's out there. Talk to me about what you explain and talk through with the customer now. So now that I've tenderized you enough in this negotiation, we are reaching the 75% mark of the horror movie where the hero finally starts to escape, and they can see the light of survival. And so what I wanna do is I wanna now confirm the price first. So this can go one of two ways. They can either give me a number that I know I'm willing to accept, or they could still be really far off. Let's start with the first scenario because it's much easier. Let's say I was at that 80 k deal, and they're like, you know what? If you could get it to us for 70 k, like, I I think we can make this happen. I'm thinking economic downturn, 70 k from 80 k, pretty good deal. But I'm not just gonna say, sure. I will always give them what they want in exchange for something that I want in return. So now what I'm gonna do is, like, look. I I think we can make something work, and now I'm gonna double lock down my deal. Hey. If I go to my finance team, the first thing they're gonna ask me is this gonna close by the end of the month. We mentioned this plan that we had earlier. Can you get this done? They say yes. Awesome. I'm not telling you I can get this done, but I will tell you that if this thing slips past that and they do acknowledge that we can get this deal done, that deal is gonna be taken off the table. So I need your word. They'll say, yes. Awesome. The second thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to force some trade offs in the other things they brought to the table. I'm I'm gonna try for those billing terms. I'm gonna try for the one year deal, but I can't promise those are gonna get done. It it sounds like the 70 k price is really the most important thing for you. Right? They'd be like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry. If you can get that, we can concede on the other things. And now what this allows me to do is it allows me to come back with the 70 k price, and I might even give them the other things too so they feel like the freaking jackpot winners. It feels like they won the lottery. That's what happens when they get you to a number that you want. Don't just grab it right away. You gotta act the part. Accept the deal very, very slowly. Now let's pretend that they gave me the number, and no matter how much I fought them up, they came up from 40 to 50 k. And this happens a lot with a savvy negotiator. Let's say that I know my floor is 60 k. What I'm gonna do is I'll always say, look, Nica. We've got some other things on the table, and I'm not gonna lie. We're gonna have to work on some of those other terms that you talked about, but I I think I can get a a six in front of this number. Is that gonna be a nonstarter? Because I can fight like a dog with my CFO to get that, but it sounds like you only wanna sign a deal if it's gonna be 50 k. And almost always, if I'm in striking distance, and it'll be like, depends on some of the other terms in the deal. And that's when I know I've got them. And so now I can start to introduce those other terms in the table and basically run that same play that I was running earlier where I can say, like, okay. After I get your reaction on that, here's what I'm gonna shoot for. I'm gonna shoot with a six in front of it, but I'm really gonna try to get you those net 60 billing terms. I'm just gonna tell you now it's probably gonna have to be a two year deal. I'm gonna try to not get it to be a three year deal. Before I go back to my CFO, I need to know if that gets it done. Nick, like, if I can go get that deal, is it gonna get it done for you? Because I'm gonna be honest, I can't even go back and make the ask. They say yes. You go back. You meet with the customer again. How are you presenting options to them? Are you scheduling a meeting? And then when you get on that meeting, what are you sharing with them? If I've done this right, what happens is I shouldn't have to give them options. I can just say, awesome. These are the three things that were important to you, and this is what we can provide. This work for you? Great. Sometimes that doesn't happen. At which point, sometimes I will literally have backup options. Or if I get the sense that it wasn't going to be the last cut, I will come ready with options. They give you a, yep. That sounds good. You're at a place where now you're gonna go back to your CFO. How are you coming back to the customer then with the options or your counter proposal? I'm always going to act like I'm gonna bring back bad news. Let's say we're negotiating on a Tuesday, and and it's the end of the month. I'm gonna preschedule a meeting with them tomorrow. I'm gonna say, by the end of the day, I'm gonna work with my CFO, and I'm gonna try to get you an answer. My guess is we're gonna have to review some of these options live because I don't know if I'm gonna get everything that you want. And so we should just be ready to have this conversation together. If I know I've got the deal in the bag, I will still not tell them that I know I've got the deal in the bag. I will tell them, hey. I gotta go meet with my CFO. I'll send you an email by end of day. Worst case scenario, let's use this meeting as a stop backstop. The moment I get off that call, look. We're in sales. We know what deals we can get done. I'm drafting an email that says, hey. Here's the terms that we can get. I know you asked for this, this, this, and this. Right? I'm glad to tell you that this has been fully approved by finance. I've included my CFO on CC, where I would literally include Matt, my CEO, on CC. I would draft up that email, and then I would time it for four hours later in the day. And the reason for that is I did not want them to think that I was getting approval right away. I wanted them to think that I was working for approval, and I want them to see that my CEO is on the thread. And Matt would always reply saying, hey. My only ask would be that you keep this confidential because we love all of our customers the same, but customers the same, but we look forward to calling you a customer soon. You have to put on the act. I'm sorry. Procurement's doing it too. That's step number one. Step number two is if you don't know you have the deal in the bag, then you might need to jump on that next negotiation call. Right? So you jump on that second call, and in that case, that's where you start to use options. So at that point, on the next call the next day, you say, hey. My CFO raked me over calls. I know these were the three things that were important to you. And, look, I think we've got something really, really good. And the reality is we can't give you everything because this would just be massively inequitable to multiple others. And if word got out, we would be seeding bad seeds in the market. And so I have two options for you based on what's most important to you. And oftentimes, what I'll do, for example, is I'll present a one year deal at a higher price and a two year deal at a lower price. Essentially, what I'm doing is I'm just forcing them to make a trade off based on what's most important to them. They're gonna be like, alright. You gave me my 20% discount. No. I want it to be 25. But when I give you two different options, now I've created a cost to you getting a bigger discount, and it's your choice. If you would like to pick the two year deal as your cost to get that discount, that would usually get the deal done in one cut. So the example you gave in terms of the options and the trade off, you use deal term and price. Are there other common related levers? Feature mix and price. So So when I was at Carta, oftentimes, customers would know that they were going to graduate into some enterprise level accounting features that they didn't need today. And so I would sell them on that full vision. But then if they ask for a discount, I would say, you can downgrade, but that's only gonna get you a $500 discount. Do you really wanna, like, lose all that future potential, all of those other features that you would normally pay $3,000 for? That's one example. Another great example is with seats. Someone will want to price in growth. I can give them an option that says, hey. You can either agree to more seats now, and I'm gonna give you a discount on those seats, but that means your price is higher today, which is how I get paid. Or you can buy fewer seats at a higher price per seat. Either way, wherever you land on the board, I win. You either get out of in at a lower number and a higher price per seat, which means I can upsell you later, Or I get more seats right now, and then I don't have to come back and try to sell you those more seats later on. So either way, I'm setting up the board such that I'm the winner in the negotiation. Great. So to recap, if you leave that big negotiation call with they have terms that you know you can do where you've almost pre agreed, you are just giving one option saying what you asked for is what you are getting. If you're in a place where it's not a 100% certain, that is when you are going to options. Follow-up question on options. How many will you present? Is it two? Is it three? Are you giving four? Are you giving them a 137 different options they can take? When I first started selling insurance, I'll never forget. I brought 20 proposals to my first customer call, and the prospect's head was spinning. I don't think most sellers do that, but I do believe that there's value in simplicity and reducing indecision. And so remove options from the table, bring two, multiyear deal, single deal. You basically wanna pick price and then the second most important variable to them and force a single trade off. Don't force 20 different trade offs. Great. You are at agreement on deal terms. Is there anything else you're doing here to make sure that you don't drop the deal at the finish line? This has been fully approved. This is what we agreed upon, big red letters. This is the due date of that agreement, and then this is what happens if we don't make that agreement, which was already discussed. Once that is done, we're getting on our call together, and this is the beauty of having that prescheduled call, and we're jumping right into our process. We're setting micro deadlines for when they're gonna get me first cuts back on their red lines, and I'm chopping up this deal like I would managing any other vendor review cycle. But I'm gonna start on the contract date, and I'm gonna work my way backwards. I'm gonna start with the contract being signed in the next three weeks, and I'm gonna say, okay. These are the two things that need to be done. Legal needs to be done, and security needs to be done. And I'm gonna chop up each of those work streams into micro deadlines. The first thing that happens in legal is you need to get first cuts back. And so I'll usually say, hey. You have four days to get me first cuts back. From there, I'm gonna return cuts to you in one day. Once I get you cuts back, you've got another two days to get them back to me. And you know why? That's because we have a prescheduled legal to legal call on day seven for any final cuts that happen. That's going on your legal person's calendar today. And the reason that that is important is the hardest part of getting legal done is getting legal to start on your paper at all. This entire process is called putting someone on a red line deadline. Deadlines for first cuts, cuts back, and the legal to legal call. Those are the three major cuts that I'll typically run-in the legal process. Now, again, I've sold bigger deals to companies like DoorDash or Shopify and whatnot. Those legal processes will take two or three months. You just have more longer red line deadlines, but it doesn't mean you don't have them. This has been phenomenal, and I know you are going to help save me some money on some deal negotiation here, but we're running out of time. We gotta move to the final question. So my final question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts far more than it helps? No unilateral concessions and negotiation. The other day, I was selling an investment property, and I tried to negotiate my realtor down on price. And so he said, Arman, totally fine. We can drop our sale commission to 2% from 3%. The only thing is all we have to do is just not take pictures that are nice. Are you good with that? And I go, well, no. Doesn't that mean that it's not gonna look as nice and it's not gonna sell for as much? Like, totally. But that's also why we charge a full 3 percent and we're not the discount brokers is we're gonna spend more on your photos. So So do you want us to discount the photos, or do you want us to discount our commission? I paid the full 3%. Create a cost to everything in negotiation. Alright, Arman. This has been a wonderful one. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It is time for a two by two recap. Number one. When they ask you for a discount or when they give you resistance on the initial price that you shared, you cannot react like that was normal. If you walked in to a Tom Ford suit store and thought, oh, gosh. I thought these suits were gonna be $60. The salesperson would look at you like you're a freak because there's an expectation that that is a premium brand. And so if they try to rattle you with some pushback on your price, you need to act a little bit surprised and thrown off. Not like it is normal. My second one is when you're actually getting into the negotiating and they are putting different asks on the table, they're giving you the full ask. Each time they ask for something and you're talking about it, you need to make it painful. If the customer asks for billing terms and you're like, yeah, we can accommodate that, what you're doing is teaching them that every time they ask and put their wrist out, they receive. We can't do that. We need to show when they put their wrist out, it's gonna get grabbed and squeezed and maybe slapped in order to get what they want. You cannot make it easy for them. Otherwise, they're just gonna keep asking. Number three, act like you're doing the impossible. Whenever you turn your back to get finance approval or CEO approval, make it seem like there's a slim chance that it's gonna get done. Jump off that call. You write up that email explaining that the deal has been approved. You cc your CEO or your CFO on it, and you reaffirm that deal expires at this time under these conditions. And you send that email four hours after the negotiation call. Do not send it right away. And then lastly, number four, if you have to go to a two part negotiation, finish the negotiation using options. Force them to make a final trade off between a single year deal and a multiyear deal, or between a bigger feature package and a smaller feature package. By forcing them to do a trade off, again, you create a cost negotiation, and you finish the negotiation in a second cut. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So, Arman, when I was first learning this very structured negotiation process, it was very helpful for me to see it written out step by step so that I could adapt the way that I negotiated in my sale to it. And, folks, if you listen to this episode, you heard the tenor and the tone and the pacing of the words when Arman was negotiating and a lot of the why behind this stuff. But if you actually wanna see this negotiation process written out in written form, we published it in the thirty minutes to presidents club newsletter a couple weeks ago. And so there's a link in the show notes. You can get it now. It's free. It's meant to help you all. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
