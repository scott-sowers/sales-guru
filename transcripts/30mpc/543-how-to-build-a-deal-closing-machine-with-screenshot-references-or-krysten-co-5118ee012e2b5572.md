## Transcript

Is not something marketing put together. Like, this is a real thing. And so customers can see easily, oh, people like me do things like this. People like me get value from something like this. If I do this, I could be next having this kind of success. I did use this. Towards the end of sales cycles, whenever they understand what we offer, they understand what it's gonna cost, and they're like, is it really worth it to do this? Then we wanna draw their them back to, like, this is the success that others have seen. It's reasonable for you to think you can have it. Let's go ahead and pull the trigger and not stop. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my host who forgot his mic to record the intro outro. So I promise you before we get into this episode, it is a freaking awesome episode. And, also, Nick had his mic for the episode. And so it sounds good too, but he's gonna sound awful now. The guest of today is Kristen Connor. She is a two or three time guest with us now. She is extremely outstanding when it comes to closing mid market and enterprise deals, especially. She's got outstanding stuff around discovery. She had over a 47% win rate and is a consistent top rep at companies like Outreach and UserGems, both of which have awesome sales teams. Nick, why should people listen? Alright, Kristen. Welcome back to the show. You might remember that we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get yours. So the overarching theme here is that what our customers say about our solution is far more valuable than what we say about our solution. And everything other customers have said helps decrease the risk that our buyers feel. So what's one way that we can do that? Super easy way is as folks as you or folks on your team get texts from customers, DMs from customers saying this is amazing or this is the ROI we're getting or this was super easy. Take those screenshots. Save them in a folder. Use them in a template, in an email, whether that's a you can use it in prospecting email, and you can use it at the end of your deal cycle to make people feel good about, like, that this is a low risk decision. Right? So that's the first one. Take me to number two. The next thing is since what other customers say about us matters so much, we wanna make it easy for them to say it. We want to make it as easy as possible for them to give us a referral. I like to not offer to write the first draft for them. I like to write the first draft for them, and it has never been easier to do that. You copy the transcripts of the calls you've had with them. You pop it into whatever sanctioned GPT, LLM you use, and then it pops out the the whole email that they can just forward, and you send them here as the customer I would like you to forward it to. I like to follow a PEERS, acronym because it's easy to remember. So p e e r s, so problem it solved, experience with implementation, experience with onboarding, ROI so far, and support. Because these are what customers care about when they especially if they're running software, which is the field I'm in. Great. Kristen, what's number three? We need to, also, hopefully, make it easy for ourselves to get these references, and I like to include those as part of my give gets even at the end of a deal to make the next deal even easier. Right? So what I mean is writing commitments into the contract. So our buyers are going to ask for things like discounts, favorable terms, white glove implementation. All those asks that they're going to make of us, we don't ever wanna give things away. We wanna get something in return. So the things that I like to ask for are, things like the buyer letting us use their logo on the website, the buyer agreeing to do three reference emails or calls, or the buyer agreeing to do a video case study, or some combination of those three depending on the special terms that they're asking for. Alright. So let's recap. In order of involvement, the three ways to use customer references or social proof are number one, screenshots of messages. Number two, reference emails, like one of your customers drafts up an email explaining their experience. And then number three is, like, a more formal, like, reference kinda situation. Let's dig into the first one. In the prep doc, you included a screenshot that I'm gonna explain right now is someone who requested a UserGems demo. And in their demo request, they said, how did you hear about UserGems? Someone from blank company reached out to me knowing more information about me than I expected them to know, and they said they use UserGems to help grow their pipeline. And so when would you use a screenshot like that in your sales cycle? Are you using that in, like, prospecting messaging? Are you using it on discovery calls? When do you use that? So I think there's an you could use it during prospecting, but if we're talking about a deal cycle, we want to reduce the risk in the customer's mind of, like, does this thing actually work? Right? Like or like we talked about the last two kind of questions in the deal of, is this juice worth the squeeze? It's like, will this actually do what we are buying it to do? And this is another company saying, like, it was almost eerie how much you knew about me. Like, do you want your sales teams to get responses like that? Like, the underlying theme is, like, buy our thing. Right? Because, like, this is this is this too can happen to you. Yeah. So could you give, like, an example deal scenario when it would be, like, or, like, a situation where it would be appropriate to reference an example like this or any of or any other of these screenshots? My favorite screenshot is taken from a, text that was sent to one of our sales reps that says, like, hey. Largest deal of the quarter started with you, and it was, 1.4 $1,040,000 deal. And we, you know, we anonymize it. We we so that it's, you know, not doing anything that we're not supposed to do. But it is so clear that, like, a a customer is seeing value. This is not something marketing put together. Right? Like, this is not, like, made up stuff. Like, this is a real thing as though customers can see easily. Oh, people like me do things like this. People like me get value from something like this. If I do this, I could be next having this kind of success. So I would use the I I did use this towards the end of sales cycles whenever we're just wrapping things up and they're they're they're weighing out. They understand what we offer. They understand what it's gonna cost, and they're like, ah, is it really worth it to do this? Then we wanna draw their them back to, like, this is the success that others have seen. It's reasonable for you to think you can have it. Let's go ahead and pull the trigger and not stall. I think the piece of it not being polished is a lot more powerful than folks realize. I remember about a year ago, I I saw our sponsorships at thirty minutes to presidents club. And anytime we are selling a sponsor deal to an advertiser, they wanna understand, like, what sort of ROI might we expect. And I did all of this work, aggregating all of this internal data from different sponsors, anonymizing it, and working with our graphics team to put together what I thought was a really sexy funnel image, 30 MPC branded. And I remember the first time I pulled it up with a customer, and they were like, okay. Yeah. But, like, this is, like, a 30 MPC thing. Like, like, what actually are customers getting? I'm like, I did so much work on this. And so I had another doc that was, like, a really ugly Salesforce report from another customer. Like, it was hideous. And, like, I pull this up. I grade some stuff out, and people were salivating over it. And I think we underestimate the adverse impact that our branding around this customer testimonial stuff has versus a text. Like, it feels real, and it feels credible. And so what you're saying, like, I've directly seen in my own deals. Mhmm. Yeah. I mean, kind of, like, the uglier it is, the more real it feels. Right? So, like, don't be afraid to use, like, that the raw, like, stuff because, also, it's of such a pattern interrupt. Right? Like, who sends an email with, like, a screenshot of a Salesforce report with things, like, circled or highlighted? No one. What do we always wanna do? Like, a pattern interrupt. Like yeah. It doesn't it doesn't have to be as hard as we make it. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. The easiest thing that you can do to set this up is looking at some of these screenshots. There's clearly a Slack channel that you had where people were sharing social proof. And I remember at Pave, we had a customer wins channel where we just asked CSMs, like, anytime a customer emails you with results on, like, our comp cycle went better than ever. We had zero comp mistakes, and we made 20 last. Anytime you get something like that, just screenshot it, put it in the channel, or take the Gong snippet and put that in the channel, and we will make it work. And it doesn't take a lot of work. Your team is talking to customers all the time. It literally takes you just creating a Slack channel and saying, hey. Whenever something comes up, take one second to screenshot it. And the CS team is always stoked to do it because CS doesn't always get a lot of credit in organizations, and you can, like, cheer them on for getting good customer results. Yeah. Yes. And the even easier way to do that now is, I don't know about Gong, but I know Fathom and we can anonymize it or whatever. There are certain call recording technology that will allow you to highlight and save anytime somebody anytime a customer says something positive, and it will because I use this with my own stuff. It will automatically send it to a Slack channel. Right? So they don't even now they don't even need to remember to send it. And I've also worked with reps where they're for whatever reason, their org does not necessarily have a Slack channel set up. Slack is searchable. So if you search for ROI, if you search for so easy, like, you can many times find that stuff on your own even if other people aren't, like, sending it to you. So it's amazing what you can find just by searching Slack or searching your call recording technology. So I wanna transition us to something that you were talking about on the preshow, which was the concept of the five questions that a customer needs answered in order to buy from you that they're not always saying out loud. And I'm wondering if you can share what those five questions are, and then I wanna ask about some of the the ones on the list. Evaluating a purchase. Anytime any of us evaluates a purchase, there are five questions that have to be answered in our minds for us to move forward with that. Number one is, do we have a problem or a goal that we urgently need help with? If we don't believe that, nothing's going anywhere. Right? Number two is, okay, what's out there to solve the problem or get us to the goal? Then, k, after we've looked at everything that's out there, what exactly do we need this to do? And then the last two are, once we understand we have a problem or a goal, there are things that are out there, These are the things that are tailor made for this problem. Then the last two questions are the most important, which is, is this juice really worth the squeeze? Whether it's time, money, process, people, whatever it is, is it really worth all the time and effort we're gonna have to put into it? And the last one is, what's next slash how does this get done? Right? Like, how do we take this from concept to reality? Am I comfortable in believing that this process will be smooth and repeatable. Question number four is, is the juice worth the squeeze? And I think a lot of salespeople look at that question through the lens of ROI on cash. We spent a $100,000, and this made us a million dollars. But I think there's other things that go into the squeeze beyond just money. And I'm wondering if you can share some of the other investment factors that a customer is weighing when they're determining the what they're putting into buying from you. Mhmm. Yeah. Absolutely. So, like, similar to the preshow, like, we talked about, there's multiple different types of risk, things that might make it not worth it. Right? There's implementation risk. What if this thing doesn't ever get implemented or the implementation just utterly fails? We've all seen that happen. Right? Then there is adoption risk. What if it's implemented beautifully, but no one wants to use it and people don't ever log in? Right? And then all of those roll up to so that well, there's economic risk. Right? We've spent money on this thing that either the implementation failed or no one uses it, which all of them rolls up to reputational risk. I said we should buy this thing, and for whatever reason, it is not working. Right? Like, this is the thing. The customer literally sticks their neck out to say, we should buy this thing. So all of these failures, all of this risk is in their mind about, like, what will this do to my reputation if it can't be implemented, if no one adopts, and all that money is down the drain. So let's talk about addressing some of those types of risk. And I'm sure you've got some ideas, Arman. I'm sure you you have some from your sales. I've even got some here. Let's start with the implementation risk. So the fear that the customer has, and I saw this happen a ton when I sold ERP software to law firms, was either a failed implementation or an implementation that wasn't properly scoped on either end. And so things like integrations or field mapping or data migration didn't go properly, and so the project got extended from what was supposed to be a six month to a twelve month to now an eighteen month to a twenty four month implementation where they spent multiple years trying to implement a new system. That's a disaster. It's a suck of money and a suck of, resources on both ends. How can I help ease the customer's concern in their mind that the implementation isn't going to go that poorly? Yeah. So utilizing kind of some of the same things that we talked about, like like screenshots from customers where they said it did, whether it's whether that's tech or DMs or, like, things from your call, you know, call recording software. One that we haven't talked about that I like to use a lot, whenever there isn't a robust, like, Slack channel. There are some companies that don't their call recording software, they can't see other people's deals. For whatever reason, if you can't access it, I like to go to, like, g two reviews and look up the reviews for that company and then just look up, like, implementation because many times people specifically mention that. Right? Like, any any third party thing where somebody is reviewing your thing where it's clear that it's not marketing, it's clear that these are somebody else's words and that you have no impact on how it's put, those are great for just taking the temperature down, right, and being making people feel better because other people have recently done this and done it easily. Right? So that's that's, you know, kind of outside looking in, things you can send that are screenshots. Then, like, we talked about, like, getting a a a existing customer to do a reference, whether that is an email or a reference call. Like, there's nothing better than customers talking to another customer being like, oh, yeah. You know what? Like, yeah, we were really worried about implementation because we had some that have gone badly before, but this just went so smooth. It was clear that they're pros of this. They do it all the time. We felt so comfortable with them. You can't ask for anything better than that. Yeah. I'll tell you one that I've used, which is actually telling the customer where their implementation might go wrong, aka where there is risk in the implementation. And I found that if you tell people, hey. This thing is gonna go a 100% perfect. There are gonna be no bumps in the road. They see you as a salesperson who's just, like, happy go lucky, happy ears, pretending that everything is gonna go perfectly. Perfectly. I'm sorry, folks. If you are implementing a tech solution with any degree of complexity, there are going to be issues, and there are going to be problems. And when I was selling ERP to law firms, I remember I would tell customers we actually don't do one data migration. We do two. Because the first one, we almost always find that there is some field that is mapped improperly, and so we test migrate the data. And it's oftentimes I forget, like, the specific area. It might have been in, like, a, oh, gosh, like, accounts payable invoice dates. But when you tell them, like, the specific area where things often go wrong, and then, hey. Here's how we typically protect against that risk. All of a sudden, they're like, okay. Cool. There's some there's some stuff here that, like, there are gonna be bumps, but at least this vendor knows about it, and there's a plan to get around it. And so for me, I found just by sharing, hey. Here are the places where we will experience bumps, eases their mind. Armand, I don't know if there's anything you did when you were at Pave or Carta that you found to ease the customer's mind around implementations. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. I think sometimes customers will ask for references because they have a risk in mind, and they think the only way to solve for that risk is to talk to another customer who did it. But oftentimes, sometimes that can mean that there's, for example, at Pave, we were selling compensation software. And people would have worries about our ability to support international compensation structures, which are notoriously complex. So one way to do that is you could have them talk to an international customer, but the reality is, like, one international customer is radically different from the next. The other way to do it is to, like, build a simulation environment where you, like, show them how their comp structure flows through Pave, and that's actually better proof than a reference. So a lot of times to your point in the prep, Kristen, people will, like, gatekeep references in sales. And I don't necessarily believe in gatekeeping references, but I do believe in doing references for the right reasons. And sometimes, a more tailored or more technical diligence process is actually better than a reference to derisk certain things. Oh, a 100%. Yeah. When I was selling software to school districts, we would do a similar thing where they would wanna talk to, you know, 12 different school districts, very risk averse, very skeptical. And, you know, they wanna talk to 12 different districts that have done the same thing, and we're like, wait. Let's just do let's just give you an a sandbox environment in a structured time where we will guide you through you doing it so they could see not only, like, it's not us moving the mouse, it's you moving this around. Right? And I and, Armand, I think you bring up a really important point, which is what customers ask for and what they want are different things. They may ask for the customer reference, but what they want is assurance that this thing will actually work. Right? That in other words, that this juice is worth the squeeze. And if we are able to help them answer that question in even a better way that they than they suggested, like, they will thank us for that. Right? So it's on us to be consultative and to understand the question that they're trying to answer and all the different ways that they can answer it versus just knee jerk being like, oh, yeah. Yeah. We can do that. There was one other example that came to mind is it was actually when both of you were saying, like, oh, it's it's what you're saying. And, look, the reality is, like, people don't trust salespeople. But I remember, Nick, I told you about this deal the other day where I introduced the prospect to our controller who was using Pave internally. The problem is our controller was only, like, three weeks into the job. So he barely knew how to use it, and I was getting destroyed with objections, from a CFO who was, like, picking apart how we were gonna do, like, compensation budgeting and everything. And so I said, hey. Here's how we've used it in the past. Here's how you're gonna use it. I basically demoed Pave to our controller, and he's, like, loosely familiar with it. And I said, these are all of the questions that I've already answered that she's probably gonna ask you again. We get on the call. She asks the exact same questions that she asked me on the call prior to our controller. My controller says the exact answers that I said. And when he said them, she completely believed him because he was a CFO who was actually using the product, and I was a salesperson who had a vested interest in the deal. And oftentimes, the same thing goes with customer success people as a salesperson will say anything to close a deal at certain companies, but a customer success person needs to live with that customer for the next three years. And sometimes you can overcome risk just by introducing the post sale team to the customer because the post sale team has a reverse interest in sales. They literally want to anti sell deals. They want to sell you out of any exaggeration of the post sale experience because they are going to be the ones who has to reset expectations with you. That's why I like that proactive customer success intro for mitigating that question around what's next, how will this get done. And for really large deals, I always, push the boundaries of the organization because I always hear, oh, well, we don't really assign customer success until after the deal is signed, but I'd like to be a delight to work with internally. Right? Like, I wanna help customer success all the time. I want to and so that when I say, hey, as I have before, hey. We have a really large deal coming through with YETI, and this is very important for us as a company. I understand that we don't typically assign customer success beforehand. But let's just but can we, in this case, do that? And here's why, customer success leader, that this is important. Right? And on certain deals, I when I would outline the business reason why we needed to do that and I didn't ask for it all the time, I don't think anyone ever said no. And so then when you not only introduce them, I like to have them for large important deals. I like to have them join on the last call or two so that it's not only, hey. I'm introducing you to Caroline. Here's her picture. It's which I would do in more transactional deals, but it's Caroline is joining us, and she's going to tell us what's next so that, that doesn't even feel we reduce the risk around it just feeling unfamiliar. They know who Caroline is, our customer success person, because she she's been on our calls the last couple of times. Like, just having her show up and nod and be like, yes. We can absolutely do that is a very different feeling. I've used that as a way to drive timeline in my deal before where towards the end, I'll never forget, I got, our best implementation leader. His name was Adam. He was phenomenal both in implementing and in front of the customer. And I had to meet this managing partner and CFO of a law firm two or three times, and they loved him. And towards the end, when we needed to get the deal done, I was like, look. Like, Adam's a high demand. Like, he's in demand. And if you wanna guarantee he's gonna be the lead on your project, which I think is gonna lead to a way smoother implementation because you've met him, like, you gotta come aboard by this data. I can hold his availability. And they freaking moved fast to get Adam. And so it actually works in both of your favors where you can use it to drive timeline, but it legitimately derisks things on both ends, both for the customer and for CS by meeting before a contract is signed. Signed. A 100 a 100%. Especially in deals where there's sometimes it doesn't feel like there's any compelling event on the customer. So I was like, they want to move. But, yeah, but sometimes the compelling event that can still be customer centric is this is our a team, and they are available now, and I can only hold their availability for x amount of time. That can absolutely I love that for driving a timeline. So we've talked about a lot of things that you could do in place of a formal reference call, whether that is the screenshots, the emails, the tailored demos, the customer success intro, all these other things. Let's say that you do have to do a reference call. I have seen some reference calls go horribly off the rails. I've seen some go exceptionally well. What is the Christian Conner like one, two, three punch list of ways to set up a reference call so it does not blow up in your face? Mhmm. Just like you mentioned prepping your, controller or CFO, like, hey. The these are the questions that they're going to ask. You need to absolutely need need to have a prep call with that reference customer or at the very least an async, like, expectation setting of, like again and again, that peers acronym. Like, let them know, like, what other people will want. So they're just jogging their memory. Right? What's the problem you solved, and how did our product help? What was your experience like with implementation? What was your experience like with onboarding? How's the ROI been? Has it been what you expected? And then how's the support been? Right? These are things people care about. And I encourage them to also think of a time that something didn't go particularly well, but that we fixed it. Right? Because people understand stuff is going to go wrong. Software or services, just, Nick, like you said, the first data pull, like, didn't go great. Right? Or the first time we tried to pull those, like, flat files and transfer that stuff, it did not go well. Right? But then we did it a second time. We knew, and and it that just went smoothly. And they that wasn't you know, that was outside of scope, but they did it, and it was no problem. It's so much more believable to hear about something where there was a hiccup and that we fixed it than just that, oh, no. I mean, like, no hiccups. Like, that's a good that's nice, but it's even better if there's some sort of challenge that got solved. Kristen, phenomenal episode. The clock is ticking. We gotta move to the final question, which is we've talked about a lot of good habits sellers should follow. Now I'm gonna ask you, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? That is sellers need to stop being so good at telling clients how to get to a signature and start being better about helping clients understand how they get to success. Right? The client did not get in this to sign something. The client got in this to solve something, and we need to frame every conversation that way rather than here's how we get to a DocuSign. Kristen, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, folks. It's time for a three step recap. One thing you can do. Alright. Three step recap. So number one, instead of requiring a reference call anytime someone needs some sort of customer proof, number one, you can use a screenshot of a reference or a testimonial in your prospecting. Number two, you can have your prospects send an email testimonial or reference. And then number three, the most grandiose reference of them all is an actual call. So you don't have to always resort to that. There are other ways to accomplish the thing. Speaking of that, number two, if someone asks for a reference call, you need to understand what they're hoping to understand or derisk through a reference. And oftentimes, a reference doesn't actually do that. Sometimes a tailored demo is the right thing. Sometimes, going through a an implementation call inside of the sales cycle is a thing. Other times, they wanna talk to a CSM. So make sure that you are solving the right problem, and sometimes a reference call doesn't solve the problem. And lastly, number three, if you do go for a reference call, make sure that you prep the reference and get them to think of something that didn't go well and they fix the problem. That is what will make your reference call believable versus seeing, like, all five star Amazon reviews is kind of, like, not believable. Alrighty, Nick. What's one thing people can do? The best time to build your reference customer list is not when you are in immediate need of a reference. What I recommend you do is go back. Don't just go through your CS team because oftentimes they'll, like, gatekeep references, and they've got a very, very limited list. Go back to every single deal that you have sold at your current company and ping the people, not just your champion, but the people that you developed some degree of a relationship with and check-in, give them a personal note, make them feel like, hey. I actually care about you as the person that sold this deal. And you'll often find that that can be just the littlest thread that you need so that when you go back to those folks in four and a half months and say, hey. I need you to talk to one of my prospective customers, they're not like, oh, you only come to me when you need something. So quick pings, this should be like a half hour sprint. Get it done, and I promise you, your current customers will help you close more deals. And what is one thing people can steal? So we talked about references. We talked about late stage stuff in this episode, Armand. One thing that often happens even after a phenomenal reference is the customer grills you on your billing terms, your price. They want free SKUs of things. We put together a negotiation master class with the king of negotiation himself, Todd Capone, where he breaks down step by step what to do, what to say, how to sound for every single piece of a negotiation. We have it linked in the show notes. It's actually on YouTube, so you can see Todd's beautiful face, as he teaches this stuff. I highly recommend watching that because that's sort of the continuation what happens next in your sales. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week.
