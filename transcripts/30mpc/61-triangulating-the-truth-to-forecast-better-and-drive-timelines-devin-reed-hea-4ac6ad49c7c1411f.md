## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Aron Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski, and we have the man, the myth, the legend, Devin Reed, head of content strategy over at Gong. Nick, why should people listen? This was one of my favorite episodes to learn a little bit more about how to actually forecast well, which is something that I've kinda screwed up in the past. So if you want better certainty about whether or not your deals are gonna close, Devin has some really good checklist questions and items you can really dig into to forecast better. I forecast that this will be a great episode. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, Devin. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. Right into it. That's why I like you guys. Alright. So the first, the best cold call opening line I've ever come up with. You ready for it? Hey, Nick. This is Devin calling with Gong. Did I catch you at a good time if there is such a thing? All I did was add if there is such a thing. And the reason it's worked is because it calls out the annoyance of my call, which is, I know there's no such thing as a good time. I'm calling it out. My goal was a laugh. If I just got a little like, I'll take it. Anything more than that, even better. But their guard was down and I would open it up to a decent cold call. I don't know if I was great at it, but that line worked for me. Hit the tone, hit the pause. It'll work great. Jerome Maldonado (3five 30Seven): Beautiful, Devin. What's your second one? Jerome Maldonado (3five thirty seven): Number two is have a big idea for your C level meetings. So I think a lot of people try to tell a C level exec about their business, which doesn't always work out because that exec definitely knows their business better than you do, even if you've been working with their team for a long time. So instead, what you want to do is come up with one big idea that intertwines what they care about with something happening in industry. So for example, if you use like Gong as an example, if you want to successfully expand overseas, you need to know exactly what's happening in those conversations and what's working and what isn't. So it's an if then is a really good way. If you want something, then you need this other thing. So that works really well. Use it as an opening and it gets people interested. Third one, this is my favorite, triangulate the truth. So the goal of this was to learn what a true buying process is. So at Gong, we were like SMB when we're getting started, and I moved into the mid market team as we established that. We started learning the buying process got really complicated, and somebody in sales ops was saying something different than in sales and someone in procurement. And so what I learned was if you're multi threaded, ask the same line of questions to everybody that you're talking to. One of two things is going to happen. One, everyone's singing the same tune. You know that you have the buying process mapped out pretty confidently. Go ahead and run forward towards your deal. Or you'd start to see discrepancies in the answers. And let's say question one, two, and three, everyone's pretty much the same, but then you get to number four and you're getting different answers. That's where you know there's a hiccup, there's something you need to get ahead of, and you want to go and and tackle that uncertainty before it finds you later in your deal. So we haven't dug into this much before. Let's talk about triangulating the truth. Oftentimes, we hear, oh, you just gotta talk to me. I'm gonna get the deal done. Two weeks later, it's the end of the month. For whatever reason, the deal doesn't happen. So what are some of the common pitfalls that will sync your deal that we can start to ask some of our prospects about? For sure. So I think the one which is like, don't worry. Just talk to me. I'll get it there is ask how they bought previous pieces of technology, right? It's like, all right, cool. I'm on totally I'm with you, man. I know you're my champion. Hey, last time you bought outreach, how did that process look? Who else did you ask for input? Don't say who else was involved because that's the old like, oh, you're trying to get to Nick, my boss, or whatever, right? Ask whose input you asked for, which means they're running Point Guard, right? And they're deciding who's involved and whose opinion matters. And what they'll do is like, oh, you know, yeah, when we bought Outreach, you know, our sales ops team need to be involved and that's ran by Derek. But sales enablement was also really important and that's run by Jane. And now you know who those folks are and you want to ask those same buying questions to them. Devin, you talked about in the triangulate the truth idea, you're asking a series of questions to start to understand the buying process. Can you sort of walk me through what are those questions that you're asking? What are the things you're trying to suss out when you're trying to understand how they buy? Jerome Maldonado (3five thirty three): Yeah. The way that I viewed this was like paranoia, which was I know on every Monday at ten a. M, I'm going to go into my pipeline review with my VP. And I know the questions that he's going to grill me and all the other reps on and it's not knowing where the budget is coming from. It's not knowing who exactly is signing the contract at the end of the day. And those are usually the two big ones. So I would go into these conversations and I would write my line of question with all the times those questions have been asked or in that same room or end of month when you hear other people lost a deal, those heartbreakers. What went wrong? Oh, I wasn't talking to the right person. I was negotiating with the VP. I didn't even realize there was a CRO, or I thought I could get the deal done without the CFO's direct approval or something like that. So I would hear all the ways deals went south and align my questions to make sure I could surface those answers. So when my VP asked, Hey, if this isn't commit, how do you know it's going to come in on Friday? I know where the budget is coming from. I know exactly how much they're allocating towards this. I know that my VP of sales is meeting the CRO on Tuesday. They're both going to meet with the CFO on Wednesday, and by 04:00, I will be on the phone with them to ensure all those things happen. When you're bulletproof and confident in that buying process, you're not hoping and wondering last week of the month, last week of the quarter. Jerome Maldonado (3one 30: So the other day was selling a deal, and shocker, guys, I have lost a deal in the past. I did lose this deal. And the reason is because I was talking to the VP. I thought I had access to power, and then who knew? A CHRO got hired, and they were the ones who made the decision to go another direction. But the VP was convincing me the entire time. He's like, no. I got you. I'm a big Pave fam. I'm all in on you guys. And I knew I had a bad feeling in my gut, but I couldn't get access to power. And so what are the right ways to artfully get access to power without the folks feeling like you're just going over their head and saying like, hey. You're gonna be the person that blows this deal up. Up. Right? Jerome Maldonado (3five fifty seven): The number one question I use is who would feel left out? So you fill in the blank with wherever you are in the process. If you're in discovery phase, you can say, hey, Nick, who would feel left out if they missed the demo? Hey, Armand. Who would feel left out if you made a purchasing decision without them knowing? For me, me leading a content team at Gong, if I bought something without our marketing ops buy in, that's no good. That's only going to be trouble later, and I know that. So if you ask me that question, I'm like, We got to go talk to Kyle. I'm not even asking for budget until Kyle's bought it. And so that's the sort of thing you want too. I think sometimes remind you might say that and they'll be like, Don't worry about it. Whoever this new CHRO is, but don't worry about him or her. It's like, Okay, cool. Start to really break down how would that make them feel? What would that process be like introducing this purchasing decision? And really get them to imagine the actual moment of giving them the news and making sure that they're still okay and confident with it. Because that's when people usually start going, yeah, I don't know. Maybe. That uncertainty, I'm like blood in the water. That's where, like you said, that gut feeling in your stomach starts to build. As salespeople, we have to listen to that. We have to run towards that confrontation and those tough conversations. So on our prep call, you were talking about this concept of soft verbal versus hard verbals. And and what I'm hearing from you is a little bit of, like, a soft verbal where it's like, yeah. I wanna go with Gong in this case. How do you get that soft verbal to turn into a hard verbal, I guess? I view it differently. I view it as like a first and a second verbal. The first verbal is like, we wanna move forward. Soft verbals spark happy years. I definitely get excited. So I'm like, I validate. I'm like, that's awesome. Like, that's so like, whatever your style is. But I'm like, that's fantastic, Nick. I'm I'm pumped up, and I know you are too. Hey, what needs to happen between this moment and Gong being in your actual hands long term? And then you're going to tell me all the things, probably realistically 60% to 75% of the truth. Not that you're lying, but that you don't have the full truth. There's a difference. There's missing information or misinformation. Then you reverse it and go, okay, what would prevent us from you getting gong long term? And then that's where the objections, potential blockers come in. It's like, oh, we know Steve. He's always involved in tech decisions and he's kind of a hard ass. Awesome. I love hearing that. When was the last time Steve said no and why? When was the last time Steve said yes and why? And then you start to prep and go, okay, now let's go meet with Steve together. And we have this map of things you're going to do and things you're going to avoid with Steve, our metaphorical Steve here. I want to sort of take this idea of like the full truth lying thing back to one of the first things that you said in the beginning, which is the triangulation of the truth and how they actually are gonna buy. And I guess it's all fine and dandy if Arman tells you the exact same buying process as what I tell you. But what do you do when somebody gives you contradictory information where what people are telling you about how the organization buys, like, doesn't match up? So you'll start to tackle one could be like budget. Right? Someone says we do have a sales tech budget, which could be true. It could also be empty. I have a bank account that could be $0 in it. It doesn't mean you're getting anything. And so if someone else is like, Yeah, we do have sales tech budget, but our fiscal restarts in July 1 and that's when we release budget. So those could be that's a good example right there. One person is saying we have budget. One might say, Same scenario. We don't have budget because there's $0 left. So to me, that's where you start to figure out, okay, budget allocation is the hurdle. That's where the truth is stop being triangulated or however you want to think about it. And so that's when you have to start peeling back the layers. Hey, I've heard that you guys have a sales budget, but maybe it's not being allocated. And I play stupid like this, which is very easy for me. It comes naturally. Help me understand how does that work exactly in your organization? Ours is released on January 1. I don't know if that's the same for you, Nick. Oh, yeah. We're in budget talks now. July 1 is when we can start spending that money. All right. Great. That's fantastic to know. Very different from us. Hey, is there anything left in that budget from now until then? Is there even 10 or $15 to work with or are we at zero? Because a lot of I'm breaking character here. Reason why is sometimes if it's a $50,000 deal and you have 25 ks now, fantastic. We'll split up the payment terms. I'll take the 25 ks, and then we'll make the payment terms. You can pay me July, August, September, whatever, the other $25. So one of the things that becomes really challenging for us is, let's say, I finally have gotten to the point where maybe my champion has warmed me up. They've gone and championed me throughout the org. They're feeling really good about buying Gong. And now they're like, great. I didn't have budget. I think I've found some budget, And now, I'm going to pass you to my good friend, Hugh. He runs procurement. And now, the deal takes a completely different path. What are some of the best practices or pitfalls that you tend to see when it comes to managing that first conversation with someone whose job is literally to get a discount from you? Jerome Maldonado (3one 50: So the pitfall is getting combative with procurement. And so I think it's easy to go into it. In procurement, I've done a dance with a few of them. I swear there are pit bulls in previous lives. They're just vicious. It's their job to say no, just like it's your job to get a yes. But you don't have to go into it really confrontational and make them the enemy. Because the truth is their job is not really to say no, it's to say no to the wrong things, and when they say yes, to make it very favorable for them. I know it's either rumor or true for some people. They get comped on discounting, like how much they discount. They also get oftentimes comped on business growth. If your product or service is going to help the company grow and they say yes, that actually benefits them as well. So I don't know. Most people don't know that or don't think that way. That's the pitfall. The only way I've ever beat procurement is by multi threading and having champions feeding me information. And so two things that I've learned is, one, you have to have a champion, higher the better, more the better. The second one, because they're tied, is never try to negotiate with procurement in one call. You actually want to drag it out to two or three calls, and here's why. When you go into that meeting with procurement, they're going to hit you with curveballs, bricks, everything to just beat you up and make you feel bad. And sometimes they'll try to jam you on the spot and be like, Yeah, you asked for 50 ks, Nick. We have $12. You can take it or leave it. They'll just hardline you. We're not going above that. The goal is to take all the information you can. Got to plug Chris Voss. He's fantastic at this. I'm not going to plug him anymore than that. Just go read his book. But get as much information as you can and then close the call. Go to your champion, champions hopefully, and feed them that information and ask if it's true or not because you're going to get a lot of false information on purpose. And so then you start to, again, triangulating the truth here, figuring out what is this is real, what is true, what is not. And the other part is once you get to that point, it does happen, right? Like, Hey, you're asking for a 30% discount. Discount. I just cannot do that. That's just not going to happen. So you can go to your business champions and go, Hey, honest to God, I can get you 18, but I can't get 30. They'll feed that information to procurement like, Hey, you've done your thing. You've beat up Devin. He's called me crying. Good job. We really want to buy Gong, and here's the deal that I really feel confident out of. And then you can tell the tone of that conversation from procurement when they come back to the table is like, you can tell they're willing to make a deal. They're willing to be a little more flexible. It's not easy. It's rarely fun, but it is doable. It's not easy. It's rarely fun, but it is doable. Robert Leonard (3one thirty three): Well, this is one of the things why you have to have a champion internally. Because if you can get on the same side as them, you can ask them the types of questions where it's like, hey, to your point earlier, like, when has a deal not gotten done? Or when it gets to procurement, how much do they usually take off? So you know where you need to come in at and what you need to do in that conversation. Because if you clean yourself out before that conversation, then you come in with nothing to offer, and that procurement guy is gonna rip your head off because he's actually gonna think or she is gonna think that that deal is a bad deal for the company. So how do you deal with that? Because a lot of times, you'll start with a sales manager, and then they'll want price, and then they'll ask for a piece so they look good to the director. And then the director asks for a piece, and then the CRO asks for a piece, and then procurement asks for a piece. And by the end, like, you're selling you're you're just selling Zoom at that point. You don't even have Gong anymore. And so how do you prevent that from happening? What you need to do is have a very frank conversation with them, which is like, it wouldn't make sense to discount at this point because we're not at the budget allocation point or we haven't finished proving value or the use case isn't fully baked or the business case, whatever you want to call it. And so at that point, it's kind of like, Hey, hey, hey, I'm actually not trying to sell you yet. We're not there yet. You know what I mean? You don't want to be like, Oh, I don't want to negotiate with you because you're a sales manager. You never want to call that a finance manager or whatever. It's just like pump the brakes and go a little bit slower. And what I think salespeople sometimes forget is removing the deal or telling them it's not a good time actually builds credibility, because people are conditioned to think salespeople are constantly trying to get me to buy. So when you pat an interrupt and say, Hey, actually, I'm not trying to sell you this month. I don't think you're ready yet, or I don't feel comfortable putting pricing in front of you because we don't even know the full value for your organization. Let's keep building the business case. Let's keep building the use case. So you look really good, Nick. When you go to Arman, I want you to look really good. That works really well because you're like, oh, yeah. Okay. That's right. I want to I I do want to look good. Nick Maggiulli (3five thirty seven): I love that. I mean, I had a call with a customer recently, and they asked me the top three reasons why their company should work with mine, like why they should buy my thing. And I intentionally only gave them two, and I said, I can't give you a third reason yet because we actually haven't we haven't done the demo here about this thing that you were asking me about earlier. And so I don't even know if that's a fit for you yet. So I hope that turns into reason three, but can we find a time to schedule that? The guy kinda chuckled and then he did. Devon, I'm also curious about the deals where we're not so unfortunate as to have to work with the folks in procurement. Do you have any other, like, best practices for negotiation in terms of things you'll say, mediums through which you'll communicate when you're maybe just negotiating with the CRO? Alex Gladstein (3five thirty three): One of the things I learned the hard way was trying to negotiate over email. And you knew from being told, you knew because that feeling in your stomach, you're like, I just know this is like I'm walking the plank, but like I'm moving forward. So I guess that's good. Not realizing one more step in the ocean. So that's one thing I'm a big no on is I will not negotiate over email. The main reason why is you give people way too much time to think to come up with a good answer that benefits them more than it does you, and it drags the hell out of your deal. It can take days, weeks to negotiate over email. So instead, what I do is I have this template I would use. Basically, it just validates their ask, says that I wouldn't be able to I have a couple of questions make sure I get the best deal for you. Can we jump on a five minute call? It shouldn't take more than ten minutes. Because when you jump over to the phone, that's where you're going to win. Because if you want to be the trusted advisor, that means you're walking side by side with them, giving them advice and helping them through it, not going, oh, you gotta go to two department heads to get budget? Like, great. Call me Thursday and let me know how that goes. One place where a lot of reps get stuck is it's the first week of the month. It's the second week of the month. You're relaxed. You're like, the red lines will come. The security review will come. All these things will come eventually. Third week, you get a little bit nervous. Fourth week, you're like, guys, we gotta start doing red lines now, and that's where most deals go to die. And so when you're starting to back out time lines, what are some of the things that you're doing? What are some of those milestones or benchmarks that you have in mind in your deal where you know like, Hey, in week one, I need to do this. If the deal is at this state, I need to do that. Jerome Maldonado (3five thirty three): The way you can start to drive timeline for security reviews, legal reviews is just say, Hey, typically it takes about two weeks to get security done. I'm big on mutual action plans like shared docs that we build together that you can see what needs to be done, who's the owner, when's it going to get done by. Because when you have that agreed, and usually that's around the pilot phase or mid funnel depending on your sales cycle, is we agree that this is the plan and we agree that we're trying to get to this end result. Now then what happens is when I put Arman's name as the owner for one of these things, a week passes, we get on the call, and you tell me that you haven't done it yet, I can hold you accountable. And I can tell you, Hey, we can't move on and get this thing, this compelling event for you because always make sure it's about the client. We're going to miss that date if we don't get caught up. So, Hey, is it fair to ask you to get that done by Thursday? And I'll make sure I get my next line item here done by Thursday as well. Let's meet Friday to make sure that we're aligned and we know what the next phase is. I guess I'm curious about the compelling event stuff because you sell to sales leaders, and I feel like sales, it's always just like, yeah, we gotta sell more. We gotta sell more. We gotta sell more. So, like, I guess I'm curious, What sort of compelling events do you guys use, and how do you attach the sale of that? There's a ton. So we're very calendar focused in sales. Right? End of month, end of quarter. They usually are too or they least understand it. Right? And they know end of quarter deals are coming, and they know end of month deals are coming. One line I would use is, like, around holidays. The The Q4 one is great, and that's where I really mastered this was the week before Christmas was when I tried to close my book just the fourteenth or whatever it was. And people would say like, Oh, well, we have the days around Christmas or before New Year's. And I'd say, Nick, I highly doubt that you want to talk to me at that time. Straight up. I know you don't want to talk to a salesperson when you're picking out Christmas ornaments with your kids or wrapping presents or going sledding or whatever it is you do. And they'd laugh and go, Yeah, you're right. I don't want to be dealing with this project at that time. Okay, cool. How about we agree to get this wrapped up on the fourteenth? Gives us plenty of time, couple of days buffer if we need it, but we'll be done long before the Christmas break. That works really well. So you can use that whether you're selling to salespeople or not. I've sold to marketing. I've sold to operations. I've sold to events. So great. You actually have a literal event coming up and we need to have this in place for your event, or an upcoming campaign, or one of the bullet lists on your CEO's slides for the top five things that need to happen this year. It's August and you haven't gotten started on number four. Great. So you know what I mean? There's a lot of different things you can use, like what I call societal trends, so holidays, calendar years, things that all apply to all of us, or things that are more industry or company specific to whoever you're selling to. Robert Leonard (3three thirty seven): You talked about putting this stuff too in a mutual action plan or a joint execution plan, a million different words for it. How do you structure yours? Ryan Bradley (3five thirty seven): I would just do a quick Excel sheet or sheets or whatever in Google. There's only three columns, right? And it's like I had a template because I knew exactly what needed to get done at any point in the sales process. Or demo one, I know I need about two more with a couple different points of contact. I know that I need that soft verbal, all those different things we talked about for price and timeline and all that good stuff. So I had all that listed out as a template, and then I would just make a copy, call it thirty minutes to President's Club mutual action plan, and open it up on a screen share with them and just walk them through these steps and then start with the compelling date at the bottom right and then work our way backward. So they'd be like, Oh, no. We've got a great legal team. Usually takes two days. And I'm like, Probably right, but let's just give it a week just in case. Right? And that's a good time to ask people too. It's like, Oh, two days? So it sounds like pretty light on the legal front. Tell me about the last time that they reviewed a contract for you. Oh, you know, actually, this is my first time. Oh, so you in my head, So you don't really know how long it takes. Great. Make it ten days. Right? Whatever it is. And you can start building that in. And people will have more ownership of something they co created than if you give them a completely filled out one, even if it's the exact same outcome as if you had built it with them. It's a fair question, right? You need to know when to do it because if you do it too early and there's too many line items, people might get like, oh, that's kind of a lot. So it kind of depends, right? So if you want to do the full sales process around like, do you have a pilot, which is a good meaty part of a sales process, that's a great time, right? Because now you're putting skin in the game. You, the sales rep, are going to put a bunch of time into it. They're going to put a bunch of time into it. So anytime you get to a point in your sales process where there's going to be some mutual additional investment of time or resources, that's a really good time to be like, Let's just make sure we're on the same page. Another one is you can just label it and you go, Hey, Nick. Sounds like you're really interested in this and that we have some legs on this. We're going to provide value X, Y, and Z. Hey, are you game to walk through and co create an action plan to make sure we go from here to that final result that you're looking for. Who's going to say no to that? There's literally no commitment. It makes complete sense. Then you pull it up, and you could also What I would do is frame it so not the whole list is up. If there's 13 line items, don't show all 13. Do the scroll or hide it so so you're only showing one, two, three at a time. Walk through it one by one, make sure they're fully You're just slowly scrolling, talking through, this will be this, any questions. And then they can I would go through the whole thing and then go backward, upward with timelines and making sure I'm not telling them the timelines? I'm suggesting timelines and making them commit June 13, June 25, whatever it is. Jerome Maldonado (3five 30Three): Well, Devin, jeez, you're really helping me become a better forecaster. My boss is really going to have a warm feeling in his heart after I listen to this episode again. But we're running out of time when we gotta move to the final question. So final question is this. We've talked about a ton of really great things salespeople can be doing to do their job better, but we gotta talk about a bad habit now. So my last question for you is, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to stop doing because it hurts more than it helps? Jerome Maldonado (3five thirty seven): It might sound counterintuitive, but it's social proof. Now, it's not that you should not use social proof, but most people don't know how to do it correctly in sales. Here's an example. I work at a Well, now we're a little bit larger, but we're a 600 person company out of San Francisco. We sell to salespeople and we sell technology. A lot of times, me right now, I know many vendors I ended up moving with but it definitely hurt their entry call is, Hey, Devin. We work with Walmart, Cisco, Google, and Amazon. Why are you telling me? They are nothing like me. I am not a public company. I don't have tens of thousands of employees. And I don't know where they're located, but I'm pretty sure, well, Google might be in my backyard. But you get the idea. I don't identify with any of the companies that you just mentioned. And the whole point of social proof is to create a tribe, a community, a group, and make you feel like you are missing out of that group. And so instead, what you want to do is instead of listing the biggest enterprises, which I get it, you're aiming for credibility, you want to say that we're trusted by the biggest and the best, but that only works if you're selling to the biggest and the best. I'm not in that. I'm just the best. I'm just kidding. I'm just not the biggest. So what you want to do is pick things like geography, industry, size of company, and the specific problem that they're trying to solve. So for example, if you say, Hey, we work with Outreach, Groove, and other technology companies that are around 500 employees and sell to salespeople who are also trying to solve one, two, three, whatever that is, Now you've created a little group of like, oh, so you know exactly about me, one, I feel understood. And two, you have experience with companies just like me solving what I want. Now your social proof is effective. Anything you want to plug before we jump off here? Yeah. I've got a new newsletter. It's called the Content Strategy Reader. Free content every Saturday, all about content creation. If you want, you can follow me on LinkedIn. Talk about sales, talk about content. And, I also publish Gong Labs, which is Gong's data backed sales research blog series. Everybody, go follow Devin. Send him a nice connection request and say, I heard him on thirty minutes to President's Club, and he's a really wonderful guy. And stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Devon Reed include, number one, a soft yes means death case. You need the hard commit, and what that means is knowing every single step it takes to get a deal done. Number two, when you're trying to triangulate the full buying process, just ask two people at the same company what the buying process is. If it's the same, chances are it's right. If it's different, you gotta dig in more. Which leads us to number three is you need to ask your buyers what has gotten deals done in the past or what has blown up a deal in the past. And that will get you ahead of some of the past graveyard of other salesmen who have failed. And then lastly, number four, the best way to beat procurement is by having a really good champion and to over multi thread in your process to get your champion to tell you whether or not the discount or the push for lower pricing is actually real. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here?
