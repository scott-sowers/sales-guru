## Transcript

I think that metrics are a strange thing. There's infinitely many that we could look at. Mhmm. But I think what you're talking about is when you define what a metric means to you, this is how I wanna tell my story, then that's when you start to take the world of infinite metrics and narrow it down to, okay, what's important to me? So, Mark, let's actually talk about what metrics we should be looking at. Mhmm. And you talked about this thing called AROM, where there are six stages of the customer journey. Mhmm. And then there are metrics behind each of those stages of the customer journey. So could you walk through what those six stages are, and then we'll dive into metrics for each. Each. Yeah. So, RM is recurring revenue operating model. It is a framework for how to think about your customer journey. And so I think that's the basis for any type of metric based conversation. If you don't understand your customer journey, you're probably not gonna be able to figure out what metrics are important to you. So the when I subscribe to is Jaco Van Der Cucci's and winning by designs revenue our recurring revenue operating model, RM, and there's six stages. The first is awareness. Awareness is we need this person who has no clue who we are and may not even be aware of any problems that they have that we can solve. We need to get them educated and figured out and aware of what's going on. Right? The second one is education. Education is where SDRs live. Education is is we're taking this person who's now aware of us and aware of a problem, and they're showing signs that they might be interested, and we need to convert that demand into qualified pipeline by booking a meeting. The next stage is at is selection. Selection is where the AEs live. This is where your sales process lives. This is like your stage by stage conversion. Right? This is where we take this person who is now qualified because they have a problem. They wanna solve it. They have all the right conditions, and we need to convince them that we're the vendor for them. Right? Then after they are so the selection, there's onboarding. Onboarding is where your implementation team lives. The idea there is how do we get them to fast value, time to value? That's the whole thing we're trying to, optimize in that part. After they're onboarded, they need to get continued value, like proactive value creation is what I is what I think that this area is about in the use where your CSMs live. Are we just sending an email every quarter hoping that they're going they're okay, or are we proactively figuring out how do we get them deeper into the platform? And then if your CS team is doing that, then you get to the last stage, which is expand. As you get deeper in the platform, you should lead people to use cases that require more products or more services that allow you to create a bigger revenue base inside that account. So that would be the expand part. So, awareness, marketing, and demand gen. Education, SDR land. Selection, AEs are in charge of that area. Onboard implementation team. Use is your CS team, and expand is your AM team. And you need to have a leader in charge of each area of this, entire process. That is their stewardship. That leader's stewardship of the people in that phase, their job is to usher them in and then help them move to the next place.
