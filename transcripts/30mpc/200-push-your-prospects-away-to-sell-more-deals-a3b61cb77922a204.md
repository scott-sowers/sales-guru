## Transcript

One of the best and most counterintuitive ways to figure out whether or not your prospect is actually serious about buying your product is to suggest that they don't buy your product. And I know this seems totally backwards, but when you suggest your prospect doesn't buy from you, two things happen. One, if they are actually serious, when they explain, no. No. No. This is why I am interested. It actually reaffirms the value of what you are selling in their mind, which actually draws them in further. And then the other thing that it does is it makes you seem so much less slimy and salesy because you're not this salesperson that's like, this is going to revolutionize your world. Instead, you're saying, hey, like, there might be other options options out there. So in this video, I'm gonna give you a couple examples of times that you might consider pushing your prospect away. Fire away. So one of my favorite places to do this is at the end of an introductory call that I have with prospective customer where they have shared a problem that I am capable of solving. What I love to do is actually suggest to them a different way of solving that problem that isn't what I sell. And so an example might sound like, let's say I'm selling an accounts receivable solution. I get to the end of the call. I might say something like, Dave, I appreciate you sharing about the big stack of outstanding invoices that you're trying to get paid. And and I definitely think our software can help with this. But before we go down this road of, like, doing a bunch of demos and talking about installing software, I guess, have you ever just considered hiring another AR clerk to deal with this? And the way that Dave responds here is actually gonna be really telling for me. One of two outcomes is gonna happen. Dave is gonna say, no. Actually, we haven't considered that, and there's a reason we wouldn't. We really don't wanna add people. We want a solution that's gonna be scalable and that we don't have to train every time somebody comes or leaves. Okay. Awesome. Now I know why my solution is better than some of these outcomes. He cares about scalability. And I'm gonna lean on that throughout the rest of the sales process because that matters to Dave. The other outcome here is Dave is like, you know, that actually is something we're considering. We're trying to determine do we bring on more human capital or do we buy software. That's actually a good thing for me to hear. And the reason for this is now I can have an open and honest conversation with the customer around the pros and cons of hiring someone versus buying my software. And my whole goal when I'm having a conversation with a prospect is to get to the truth. And you wouldn't have gotten that truth unless you had suggested an alternative course of action here. So even if they are looking at a different solution, that's a good thing because I have knowledge which can help me sell my product. Another area where this is super effective is after you've given a presentation or a demo of your product or service. And so if you imagine a world where you just gave a presentation to three people at your prospect's company, and there was one person where he sort of got a funny feeling from. They were either super quiet and didn't say anything or they seemed sort of skeptical about whether or not you could actually help. You should address that. So when you talk with your main point of contact or your champion after that presentation, call it out. And you might say something like, you know, Dave, it seemed like Emma was sort of skeptical about whether or not this might actually be able to help you guys. And I don't know if you've talked with her, but I'm wondering, do you feel like she might have a point? Again, one of two outcomes here. Either he's like, yeah. She does have a point. This might not be a fit because of these reasons. That's a good thing. I can now address those reasons. The other outcome is he's like, don't worry. Emma's always skeptical of anything that we put in front of her. I I'm not really taking that opinion into account. Either way, I'm getting to the truth. If you sense something, say something. The third and perhaps the most effective area to use this technique is when you're talking pricing with your customer. Because no matter what your product or service costs, it could cost a penny. It could be free. Your prospect is always gonna tell you, oh, it's way more expensive than what we're using right now. And that's their way of trying to get in your mind to make you lower your price. And so one thing that I'll do is once I've given a proposal and the prospect has shared, hey, you know, we're paying way less. I wanna sort of pressure test him and say, gosh. You know, Dave, you've shared that this is almost twice as expensive as what you're using right now. And I get there are some issues with your current product, but that seems like a pretty big jump. I mean, how are you feeling? Boom. Now one of two things happens. Dave is either, hey. You know what? You're right, man. Like, there's no way we're gonna get this in the budget. Cool. I can either address that concern. Maybe there's some levers I can pull to change the pricing or make sure this gets done. Or I might decide that I should walk from the deal and go focus on other deals. Deals. That information is my ally. Now the other outcome here is Dave is like, yeah. I know this is more expensive, but we have a serious problem and we're okay spending to solve it. Boom. Information is my friend in this scenario, and I get it when I go for the truth. So the moral of all of this is if you sense something might blow up your deal, call it out. You never have anything to lose getting to the truth with your prospects. Customers do not trust salespeople that believe and act like their product or service is the only way to solve their problem. It's actually a good thing to be a little bit more tempered. And by subtly pushing away, you will get more trust and more truth with your prospects. That's it. If you liked this video, give us a subscription. I would love a comment.

So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
