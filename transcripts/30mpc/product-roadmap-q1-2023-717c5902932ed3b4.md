## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this road map episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today is a special road map episode. Normally, every quarter, we go through the upcoming content for that quarter, but this one is not just gonna go through the upcoming content for this quarter. We're gonna talk about what we've done over the last couple years and what that means in terms of what we plan to do for 2023 because it's gonna be a big year for 30 MPC folks. And so, Nick, what are we gonna cover today? We're doing two things. One, we're gonna give you all a look behind the scenes into the business of thirty minutes to presidents club, and we are also going to give you a look into the future to see some of the content that we have coming down the line in the next quarter. Alright. And so let's start with a look backward down memory lane. And so believe it or not, we are about to turn three years old, everybody. And so we started this thing back in 2020. And what happened is when COVID hit, Nick and I were two lonely guys who didn't really like listening to Netflix, or maybe we couldn't afford it, or maybe we were too cheap cheap to buy it. And so instead, we decided to flip on two microphones and start talking to really good salespeople because we felt like there was no one in the world who was really getting into tactical sales content. In other words, the things that people are actually using today, not things that people used to use back in the eighties. And so 2020 was the year of starting the podcast. Then 2021 hit. And, basically, we just kept doing the podcast, but you all helped this thing take off. What happened is we had a bunch of banner guests, whether it was Joe Caprio or Kyle Coleman or Morgan Ingram or Jason Bey. The faces that people associate with thirty minutes to presidents club, all of a sudden that made this amazing show. And by the end of the year, we were pacing to have the most downloads per month out of any sales podcast in the world. So 2021 was the year the number one podcast, and that's because of everyone that's listening today. Then in 2022, we launched tactic teardowns. In other words, our first ever webinar series alongside the newsletter and other things too. And that started with a humble number of registrants. And by the end of the year, at times, we have paced over 3,000 people registering for a single webinar, and that has made us now the number one sales webinar series. And so, Nick, 2023 is not the year of the number one podcast. It's not the year of the number one webinar series. It's actually the year of the club or in other words, the year of the number one platform. What does that mean? Well, I distinctly remember one of our very first thirty minutes to presidents club planning meetings before we even launched the show. And one of the big decisions we made upfront was we did not want thirty minutes to presidents club to be just the Nick and Arman show. AKA Nick and Arman come on and blather about all of the stuff that we know, how we're great sellers, how we we are the best at knowing how to execute on every element of selling. We wanted the show to be something where we highlighted other people. And so if you listen to our episodes, it's like 88% the guest talking, and that is by design. We want to tease out the best tactics and habits and battle rhythms of the best sellers out there. And we have a lot of people that come to us, Armand, and say, oh, I wish you guys did more content. I wish I wish you guys did a course. I wish you guys would record double the number of the episodes. And the decision that we have made is we are going to release something that you will see called the president's club or the club, where if there is an elite seller out there, we've started to get to know some of the best salespeople, in The United States, some even in the world, actually. If they are creating content, we want them doing it associated with thirty minutes to presidents club. And so you're gonna see more thirty minutes to presidents club content, hyper tactical, extremely value dense, only stuff that you could pick up, steal, and use that day, but it will be other people in addition to me and Armand. And and what that might mean is you might have one of our three time guests maybe host a webinar. You might have a guest host on the podcast. We had some amazing success with Sarah Brasier's cold call script or Charlotte Johnson's cold email drip, And you're gonna see more and more and more world class creators amplified by 30 MPC so we can continue to create more and more and more killer content for you guys as well. Now, Arman, in order to do that, we're gonna need a little bit more horsepower. And for those of you listening, y'all might know that I came full time with thirty minutes to presidents club back over the summer. And I am so pleased to announce that we have acquired a new employee. And this person I don't know. I was gonna make a joke or something, Arman, but you're coming full time, and I'm grateful for you because I know how many Saturdays and Sundays and evenings and 6AM recording sessions you've done with me to make thirty minutes to presidents club work. So I'm just gonna say welcome to the team, and I would give you a hug if we weren't on Zoom right now. Amazing. And so, everyone, just to give you a little bit of a look behind the scenes in terms of what this means is the way that Nick and I divide up duties at thirty minutes to president's club is he takes on everything related to sales. And what I mean by that is he's responsible for selling sponsorships. He does a lot of the customer success. He makes sure that we have good content collaborations with our sponsors, etcetera. I manage our product and our marketing. So anytime you see a concept for a new webinar or you see the newsletter come out or we think about doing things like Sarah Brasier's cold calling script, that's really me. And so we've gotten to the point where Nick has done this amazing job bringing on so many new sponsors, and we wanna create more content, but, really, I've been the blocker to that. And it's killing us because everyone that's listening this episode now is asking us to get on TikTok or to write a book or to do double the episodes per week, and we can't because I'm the blocker on product. And so as always, folks, what this does not mean is we become less relevant in the world of sales because I'm no longer the VP of sales at a company. What this means is this allows us to get even closer to the best sellers in the world and, again, create the club so we can give you all even more content. And so as my first motion being full time, what I would like to ask the audience and everyone listening right now is we have three or four things that we're thinking of doing from a product standpoint, and we cannot launch all of them this year. But there are a couple really exciting ones, and I want you all to email us after this and tell us which product idea you are most excited about. Okay? But before we do that, Nick, can we tell the audience how we think about launching new products? Yeah. We have taken great caution not to get distracted by shiny object syndrome. It would be extremely easy for us to say, you know what? Let's launch a course and get on YouTube, and we're also gonna do coaching, and we're also gonna do consulting, and, oh, we're also gonna launch a software product, but we won't do that. Our three pieces of criteria anytime we decide to take on a new venture at thirty minutes to presidents club. One, can we be the best in the world at it? Not can we be good at it, not can we be great at it, but can we be the best in the world at it? If we can't be the best in the world at it, somebody else should do it. Two, do we actually care about it? There's a lot of things, Armand, I think you and I could be great at. I could be a professional guacamole eater, but I don't know if I would really care about that. I might enjoy it, but I don't know if I would really care about it. So we have to have some passion for the stuff we're doing. We have to be able to be the best at it, and then it also needs to be economically feasible. What we're not gonna do is stuff that we can't actually monetize and, I don't know, pay our rent with now or our health insurance. So if those three criteria are met, we will consider doing it, and you have some ideas. That's exactly right. Alright. So we're gonna run three of them by you all. And at the end of this, Nick will remind you, but please email production@30mpc.com and tell us which of these three you'd want to see. K? So number one is if twenty twenty one was the year of the number one pod, 2022 was the year of the number one webinar series, One idea is 2023 could be the year of the number one sales book. It is amazing how forward thinking and how tactical some podcast guests can get. And it's not just our podcast. Even other podcasts out there are talking about the latest and greatest in terms of sequence technology, how to structure an outreach cadence, what have you. But then you read some of these sales books, and they are totally stuck in the dark ages. Right? And so what we found is that there's a lot of really dated written content, and the sales book scene could use a little bit of a refresh. And so we've thought about launching a three part book series, which would be the book on cold calling, the book on cold emailing, and the book on how to be a machine back to back to back. And so we could launch a three part book series. That's number one. Number two is a lot of people have said, why don't you do a podcast on sales leadership? We have so many different ways to open a cold call, but we don't have a way to run a manager one on one or to run a pipeline review or to forecast. Right? How do you think about hiring? How do you think about building a team? Right? And now with me full time, one idea would be to make Mondays the leadership podcast and then Wednesdays the seller's podcast, the traditional thirty minutes to president's club. That's number two, leadership content. And then number three is we get a lot of requests for video content. And what I mean by that is some people have asked us for, like, video course style stuff. Other people have asked us for YouTube videos. Other people have asked us for short form content like TikTok videos. That's the third bucket that comes up a lot because we do a lot of, like, audio and written content, but not a ton of video content. Alright? So to recap, the three buckets are sales book, leadership content, or video content. Those are the three. You can also email us at production@30mpc.com with four, none of the above, or five, here is something else that I would recommend you do. And so the world is your oyster. Let us do the deciding on what we actually decide on, but please flood our inbox with ideas, and we truly do read and try to reply to every single one of those emails. Yes. So let's talk about some of the stuff that we are actually pursuing in the next quarter, which is content. So for those of you who haven't shown up on our tactic tear down webinar series, the reason that we launched that is it's easy to talk about how to open a cold call on a podcast. And it's easy to talk about best practices for email, but it's kinda tough to, like, teach somebody how to write a sales email if they can't actually see it. The visual element is extremely important. So we explicitly create webinars that could not have been a podcast because a big piece of the value density on those is actually seeing what is on the screen. So upcoming in January, we're gonna be doing a live cold email objection handling class with Arman and Josh Braun. In February, we'll be doing a cold call clip critique review with Sarah Brazier and Jason Bey. And then in March, we're gonna be doing a discovery tape review where we're gonna be actually replaying somebody's discovery call and pausing throughout to help review the game tape, and that's gonna be with Charles Muhlbauer. So if you go to 30mpc.combackslashteardown, you can get on the latest one. There's also a link in the show notes. We would love to see you there. Alrighty, folks. And what will this be headlined by is in q three, we launched the first ever tactic toolkit, which was Charlotte Johnson's cold outbound drift. And thousands of people downloaded that, and then thousands of people the next quarter downloaded Sarah Brasier's cold call script. And so we're starting off this year not with something prospecting this time, but we're starting it with something associated with discovery. And that is going to be my very own big team meeting deck. In other words, after you've done a discovery call and now you're doing a demo with a big team and you need to run a room of more than two to three people, what is a deck that you can use to work the heck out of the room without decking someone to death? Alright? And so you've got your webinars of the quarter or your tactic tear downs of the quarter rather. You've got your toolkit of the quarter, and then you have the number one question that you can answer for all of us. And, Nick, could you remind the audience one more time how they can help us before we leave? Yes. So the email to email is productionproduction@30mpc.com. Let us know how you're feeling about the different content paths that Armand proposed. Should we write a sales book? Should we create sales leadership content? Should we be creating video content? Should we throw all of those ideas in the trash and just do nothing, or should we do something else? Let us know. We really value your feedback. And as always, thank you for listening to thirty minutes of stress test club. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out.
