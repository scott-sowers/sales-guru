## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this special episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Skalski. And, folks, folks, today, we have one of the legends out there in the sales world. His name is Jeremy Lee Miner. He is the founder of Seventh Level Sales. He is running a 10 figure training business. He has massive clientele all over the world, and he has over 700,000 followers on Instagram. And he is a master of tonality throughout your sales process. Nick, why should people listen? This was the best episode, I think, that we have done on tone because Jeremy breaks down the five, maybe five and a half, different types of tone that you use in sales conversations. He gives a ton of examples. He gives the rationale and logic behind it. He talks about everything from using your face as a remote control for your tone to the pacing of asking questions to rustling papers as a way to sort of add to the tone and environment. This is a really good one if you believe, which I do, what you say matters less than how you say it. And three, two, one. Let's roll. Alright, Jeremy. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Alright. So the first one is how do you get a prospect into results based thinking over price or cost based thinking even from the very first words or questions out of your mouth? Because the problem that most salespeople have is when they get on there, let's say if it's a Zoom call or something like that, it could be in person or whatever, we think we're building rapport by saying, hey. How's your day going? How are you doing? Oh, where do you live? Do you live in Atlanta? Oh, your offices are there. I love Atlanta. You know, I'm gonna go there. I love the Atlanta Braves. Blah blah blah blah blah for the first two minutes. And you can probably tell if you can see the prospect's body language that they're just kinda like, yeah. Even if you think they care, more than likely they don't care. Why? Because they're used to every salesperson that's ever tried to sell them anything, asking them the same predictable questions. So while you're going through your questions in that conversation, a lot of your prospects are thinking all the time. How much is this gonna cost? How much is the price? They might not ask you that, but they're thinking of that. And so what I wanna do is I wanna reframe their way of thinking immediately into the end result. Okay? You're not selling the thing. You're always selling the results of what your thing does. Right? So if I'm selling life insurance, I'm not selling them a policy. I'm selling them the results of what that policy does when one spouse dies and the rest of the family is financially protected. Right? If I sell, let's say, SaaS, I'm not selling them a software. It could be for one company, I might be selling them on automating their award ceremony. Right? So I'm selling the results of what the thing does. So when I'm getting them in results based thinking, I'm changing the way they're thinking. Just give an example. Let's say, I I think a lot of your listeners are in SaaS. That's a big industry retrain in. And let's say that they sell to associations that manually have to do everything for their contest awards and everything, and they have a software that automates it. So it saves hours a day. Their employees having to, like, do that rather than other tasks they're supposed to be doing. So I might get on there for that first appointment and and just get on there. Hey. You know, welcome to the the call. Okay. So I've got and I'm looking down my notes. Okay. So I've got can you hear me okay? Okay. Good. Now I've got, looks like you talked with my associate, Tyler, the other day about looking at, some possible help, like, with maybe automating your awards program instead of having to do it manually. Right? Right. See, that's a question. Right? See, I'm getting them immediately automating your your awards program so you don't have to be doing it manually. Right? I'm getting them to that end result if that's what I was selling. That would be an example of what we call an NEPQ connection question. Now throughout that conversation, I'm always asking questions that keep them into that results based thinking over price or cost. If you're only focused on the money, money, money, all you're doing is seeding in their brain that maybe they can get it cheaper somewhere else, and you get commoditized. And that's when they go around looking at all these other quotes and bids when you don't have to if you knew how to get a results based thinking. Really good. What's number two? Number two is what's the difference between objection prevention versus objection handling? Because I would say that most salespeople been taught like, oh, I've gotta get really good at handling objections. I would suggest if you wanna be a top 1% salesperson in your industry, you gotta get really good at preventing objections from even happening in their mind. Why do objections even happen? What triggers a prospect to have an objection? Do they wake up that morning and say, you know what? Today at 03:45, when that salesperson tries to close me on that policy, I think I'm gonna go into fight or flight mode and I think I'm gonna tell them I need to talk with my spouse. I'm gonna blow them off. Like, that's not what they planned on. It wasn't a planned reaction. That's a triggered reaction because of your sales ability. You didn't build enough gap from where they are to where they now see they can be that they have uncertainty. They have a lack of certainty. Lack of certainty or uncertainty causes a prospect to procrastinate and have objections. We as human beings have a core fear of change. So our job as salespeople is how do we help them overcome the fear of change? So one little technique you can do is let's say that you're presenting in a boardroom. Okay? Just give me an example. Could be on Zoom. And you go through slide 10, and you notice Gretchen, like, crosses her arms like this and kind of looks up and grimaces. Well, what are you gonna do? Hope and pray that Gretchen doesn't have an objection and hope and pray that after you leave that your your two people you already know in that boardroom are gonna sell it for you. No. I don't wanna take that chance. I might stop. Hey, Gretchen. You seemed a bit hesitant when I went over that last slide. What's what's behind that? What's going on? Just a little soft concern to him. He seemed a bit hesitant when I went through that last slide. What's what's behind that? Just so I understand. Well, Jeremy, I didn't understand how that was gonna integrate with our database and blah blah. Oh, okay. Well, in that example, here's how it works. And now boom, I prevented an objection from happening after I left or maybe even while I was there trying to close him. That's just one little example of how to prevent objections from happening in their mind.

So, everybody's sort of always be closing, which obviously you have to close, but I'm more concerned about how do I always disarm the prospect because is it easier to sell to prospects if guards down or if their guards up? I think we all know the answer. Well, the thing is, do you know what triggers a prospect's guard to come up compared to you? Do you know how to trigger it to come down? That is called always be disarming. Okay? So from the first words out of my mouth, the first questions I'm asking, I'm always looking, and I'm reading their tone, and I'm looking to how do I disarm this prospect where they start to emotionally open up. So let's say I get three fourths of the way into the conversation, and the prospect, they really haven't opened up. They've been very surface level because I haven't learned, you know, how to use my tone to open them up yet. I might lean and say, John, can I, can I ask you something? See that soft concern tone? Yeah. Sure. Go ahead. You know, this and this is between you and me. You know, it's a it's course, you know, off the record. I'm not gonna go share it on social media. What's the real reason why you guys might be looking at other vendors rather than staying with who you have? K. So I lower that tone into that soft concerned tone, and you'll find that the guard starts to come down. It start to emotionally open up. So that's just one little example in in that context of what to do to disarm the prospect. Jeremy, you just talked about using tone to get someone to open up. Yeah. And what that means to me is someone can ask a question with the wrong tone upfront Yeah. And you're gonna get a completely different answer Yeah. Versus if I use the soft concern tone of a curious tone. So let's just transport ourselves back to your first takeaway. Yeah. So you said, oh, it sounds like you talked to this person on my team and, yep, you wanted to learn more about automating your reward ceremony so you don't have to do it manually anymore. And so they're like, yeah. Yeah. That that's why I reached out. How do you open them up from there? Well, you go into your next, what we call, NEPQ connection question. So I might say, hey. So when you were talking with Tither, what was it that you guys were, I guess, kinda going over that caused you to, you know, wanna wanna look into this further? That's it. It's just a connection question because what I'm doing is, once again, I want to take the focus off me and immediately put on them. I wanna disarm the prospect, and I want to get them into results based syncing over price or cost based syncing. So that type of question in that context gets them to start telling me what they said that caused them to wanna look into this further. Notice I'm very neutral. I I can't be assumptive here too early because I don't have any trust or credibility with this prospect. When I get further in the conversation, I can be more assumptive. But right here, you start assuming things, especially with a type c level executives, thinking about, well, we're just kinda looking into it right now. So that caused you to, you know, wanna look into this further. See, I'm still neutral. Now as I build the gap and pull out pain and help them relive the pain, I get more assumptive. Right? But I'm not gonna do that in the beginning. And, also, most importantly, than them telling me while they're looking, more importantly, who are they telling? Themselves? See how I'm automatically getting them into that result based thinking of why they even talked with the SDR or why they responded to an ad, whatever it was. I know that you are extremely intentional with your tone, and you've mentioned a couple different types of tonality you use. Can you talk to me about the different types of tonality, when you use them, and what they should sound like? There's five type of tones you have to master. Now there's subcategories of each of these tones, but I don't wanna go over anybody's head. So there's the curious tone. Okay? In certain questions, I have to ask it more of a curious tone. There's reasons for that. So when do I wanna ask a question in a curious tone? It would be those type of questions I just asked. It's like you're coming across from, like, a curious manner. Am I might get into situation questions? Now can you give me an idea of the the volume of submissions you get for your awards every year? Or what do you have in place right now, you know, to pay off the the the full mortgage and, like, your credit card debt and the cars when you do pass away? Right? If I was selling life insurance. So it it doesn't really matter. See, that's kind of a curious tone. Like, I'm curious. Now I do wanna talk about one subcategory of the curious tone because it's probably one of the most important, and that is a familiar tone. Okay? Now a familiar tone is really, really important if you call outbound leads, meaning that they respond to some type of ad, put in their name, email, phone number, but they don't know who's calling and when. There's no scheduled thing. Or especially if you cold call. Okay? So when I call, I had to learn this the hard way because my first industry I sold in was door to door sales while I was in college. Right? I started learning tonalities and different things like that from my background in behavioral science in school, and I started to have to learn how do I disarm them on the doors. Well, then I went into b to b sales at the enterprise level selling debt relief services to larger companies and some SMB. And I had to learn I'm on the phone now. They can't see me. So I had to learn how do I sound familiar when I cold call these companies where they feel like they should know who I am. Because what do most salespeople do when they cold call? What's the average pitch? Like, hi. Is this John? Yeah, John. Hey. It's James Miller with x y z company. Hey. Listen. The reason why I'm calling you is and right at that point, where does the prospect's brain go to? They're like, what are you trying to sell? It's fight or flight mode. It's the survival part of our brain. It's just how god wired us whenever he put on first humans here millions of years ago, thousands of years ago. I I don't know when that was. We'll find out one day. But it's that survival part of our brain that when we feel like somebody's trying to sell us something, we instantly like, our guard goes up. We're trying to protect ourselves. Right? Not from the saber tooth tiger. Now we're trying to protect ourselves from, like, marketers and salespeople because we're sold to all the time. Okay? So if I come across with more of a familiar tone, what I also learned how to do I'll actually show you guys this. Let me grab a piece of paper. I actually learned how to do this when I was cold calling about a month in with my my b two b career. And I was just shuffling through some papers when I was just calling a random lead, and I noticed that the the person, like, they just listened the whole time. And I'm like, what is that? You know? So I just started doing that shuffling paper. So, like, like, legitly, we teach companies and salespeople to do this time. So yeah. Is this John? Yeah. John. Hey. It's it's Jeremy Jeremy Miner, with x y z company. Yes. It's John. John Smith with with x y z company. I'm holding a copy of your 2023, revenue reports. I was wondering if you could possibly help me out for a moment or whatever it is. Let's say your investor calling a, home that's going to foreclosure because you wanna flip it or whatever. Yeah. Is this is this Mary? Yeah, Mary. It's it's James. James James Miller with x y z company. I'm pulling a copy of your property taxes on your home there at 55 Willow Lane there in Savannah. I was wondering if you could help me out for a moment. See, it's a panorup. So the first part of that, it it's John. John Smith. That sounds like what? Somebody they already should know. It's familiar. Okay? So these little nuances add up because if you ever got a call from somebody like, hey, Nick. It's it's Amy. Amy Smith. How are you doing? And you're Nick. You're not like, who is this? You're like, I'm doing great. And and they keep talking and you keep going. And in your mind, like, who's amazing? Did I go on a date with her? Did I meet her in network? Did you want I should know her, and you wouldn't dare be rude and say, who is this? I'm telling you, on cold calls, we have some companies in different industries, especially real estate. They're getting, like, a 71 to 73% booked call from cold calls, from a first cold call to book in the second call. So out of 10 people that answer, you're talking seven out of 10 go to the next step. And a lot of it is just learning how to have that familiar tone. Right? Ruffling the papers. I know it sounds kinda stupid and corny, but they're hearing something on the phone. It triggers curiosity. Yeah. I'm holding a copy of your looks like your it's your property taxers here on that home in at the 55 Willow Lane there in Savannah. I was wondering if you could help me out for a moment. They don't know if you're an IRS agent. They don't know if you're a county clerk. They quite literally don't know who you are. But the point is is I'm triggering curiosity rather than triggering fight or flight mode where they're trying to get rid of me. And then I go in the second half. Well, and I'm not even sure if it it makes sense for us to talk. I've worked with a group of buyers who are looking to buy four or five different properties there in that four block area where your Savannah home is. And after they had me go through your tax records on the home, they asked me to reach out to you to see if you would be maybe even opposed to getting an offer on the home. Would you be against talking about that? No. I'm not a good set. What do you have? Not not are you open to that? Okay? Where I get a yes. I actually in certain circumstances, I want them to say no. You you guys ever heard of Chris Foss? Chris Voss was on a podcast a couple Yeah. I love Chris. So a lot of that, you don't really learn in school, but in behavioral science, there's a theory called social dynamics. And so you learn how the brain, is triggered to say yes compared to how is the brain triggered to say no, like, what neurons go off. And so what Chris has done well is he's learned that actually getting them to say no in certain context is actually way better than forcing them to say yes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. So we've got this curious tone, and this is how you and I actually met as you tore down one of our reels where we were teaching the heard the name tossed around. And you actually said this one's much better than most openers that I hear. And the main critique you had was I wanna make sure that people are doing it with a familiar tone. I was yelling at a happy hour in a clip. I was screaming in the mic. And so the way that we teach it is it honestly, it matters much less what you say. But if I'm like, hey, Jeremy. We work with the Fuocoas Koya portfolios. It's Arman from from Northwestern. Have you heard her name tossed around? Some of those intentional stutters, those stops, those repeating my name two times, it almost makes you sound human. And it's similar to why you crumple the papers too is if I say, Jeremy, we work with a few of those Koya portfolio companies. It's Arman from Northwestern. Have you heard her name tossed around? It's too clean. It's too tight. It's too rehearsed, and it's almost like you're stumbling upon it. It's so salesy. That's what a lot of people don't think because, you know, sometimes I'll I'll do a reel and they'll you know, every once in a while, I'll look at some of the comments and they'll be like some person you you sound, like, confused. You you gotta be professional. And I'm like, that's why you're getting one out of a 100 people you talk to the book. Because you sound so damn professional and scripted in that first thirty seconds, and your prospects are used to 20 other salespeople cold calling them every week that sound exactly like you, scripted, that they're not even hearing your words, quite literally. Let's say if I'm walking across the street and I hear somebody yell, like a woman scream, instantly, you're like this. But your brain, the first thing it heard was the sound or the tone, but it didn't hear the words. That's why you react. Am I safe? You're reacting. You didn't even hear the words she said. So that goes in your survival brain, the sound. Survival part of our brain. Some people call it the reptilian part of the brain. Then immediately goes about a second or so later into your midbrain that starts to interpret the words, and then it goes up to your neocortex, which is your problem solving part of the brain that says, oh, that lady was just yelling at her son to be safe crossing the street. You see how that is? So on a cold call, you're right. They don't even really hear your words that first ten, fifteen seconds. They're just hearing your tone. And if your tone sounds scripted, salesy, too excited, you're quite literally you could be like, this is the IRS. You know, you have got a refund of $750,000 and not interested. Right? They don't they don't hear the words. They hear your tone. So if I have that familiar tone and kind of, like, confused, but not confused like you're an old man that has dementia confused. I think that's a difference. Like, confused like you're not quite sure if they're the right person to talk to. You're not quite sure if you can help them. That's what I mean by confused tone, which is the second tone. Okay? Or let me give you another example here. Let's say that the prospects gosh. This is this problem is causing us a lot of stress. Oh oh, how how do you mean by stress? See, that's a confused tone. Now my facial expression has to match my tone. Right? Because your facial expression, I always say, is the remote control to your tone. Because try having a confused tone with a straight face. Really hard to do. Okay? So, oh, how how do you mean by confused? Or how do you mean by feeling pressure at work? See, now what happens immediately in the subconscious part of the brain is their brain says, oh, he didn't understand what I meant by stress. I need to expand on that. I need to explain that better. Well, what I mean, Jeremy, is just last week, we had this issue where blah blah blah blah blah. And now that confused tone caused them to emotionally open up and start to relive their pain of the situation. And that's where most salespeople just haven't learned because they ask surface level questions. Can you tell me two problems you're having? What are some challenges are going on? What's your budget for this sort of thing? What are you looking for in a solution? And then we go into our pitch, and then we wonder why most say I need to think it over or keep looking. Because you're not emotionally getting them to relive the thing. The two biggest emotional drivers that causes a human being to wanna change are pain and the fear of future pain. So if you can't help them relive their pain of their current situation or their past and then have a fear of continuous pain, or let's say if I sell life insurance, have a fear of future pain, I'm gonna die, family's not protected, that prospect feels no need to change. And when they feel no need to change, that's why you get tons of objections, and that's why they don't buy. So my tone can influence whether I open them up emotionally or not. That's just one little example of where I'd use a confused tone. So to recap, you've given us three and a half types of tone. Number one was your curious tone, and you're using that oftentimes at the beginning of a call when you're trying to get someone to open up as to, oh, what was that reason that you took the call in the first place? And then the familiar tone is almost reminding them of someone or reminding them of of a story. So that was type one and type 1.5. And then you gave us number two, which was the confused tone. Yeah. And it sounds like you're asking people to expand on something. Yeah. It it's a technique to get them to open up. Oh, how do you mean by you're feeling pressure at work? That brings us to the concern tone, which you mentioned a little bit earlier. And it sounds like you're using the concern tone to confront uncomfortable objections or conversations. Could you expand on that a little bit? A concern tone is a tone that shows empathy. So in a concern tone, there's so many times I might use a concern tone, and it it depends on the context. Right? So let's say if I ask a, I don't know, like a consequence question. Let's say if you sold life insurance. Okay? How long would Cindy and the kids be able to pay for the house and and the and the credit cards and and the cars without your income? See, that's a very personal question. I'm not gonna ask that in the first two minutes. That's later in the conversation. But you see, my tone sounds concerned. I'm concerned for you. Okay? That builds trust because if you've if they feel like you're concerned for their situation, they feel like you're trying to help them solve something or get somewhere. They don't feel like you're just selling them something to make money. Let's say they're not moving forward. They keep procrastinating. You've had call after call after call. They're just procrastinating. I might stop and say, Nick, just role play. Can can I ask you something? Yeah. Go ahead. Ask me anything, Jeremy. Now this is off the record. I'm not gonna tag you on social media. What's, what's really holding you back from moving forward? You see the tone. That's a I'm now the way you really start to learn how to use a concern tone is when you ask a question with a concern tone, it's easier for you if you're standing up or setting down if you lean in like this. Your body, your vocal cords will soften up a little bit rather than up here. I can do it up here because I've, you know, I've I've done this for so long. But if you're new to this and you're learning a concerned tone, you won't sound that concerned up here like standing or stay or setting straight up. You've gotta lean forward. Well, what's really holding you back? See, when we lean forward, our voice tends to become a little bit softer. It's hard for us to be so loud when we lean forward in a chair. So that's a concern, tone that shows empathy. Then we have the challenging tone. Okay? Now you're not gonna use a challenging tone early in the conversation. You don't have much trust or credibility. But let's say I get closer to the end of the conversation, and I might say, so what happens if you don't do anything about this and you keep getting these complaints from the judges and the board about the process you're running? And then at that point, they start questioning if you're even gonna have the job. Okay. So I start challenging because I'm triggering an emotion, and then I end with a concerned tone. So what if you don't do anything about this? You keep getting these low quality leads, and your salespeople keep going over to all those competitors. I mean, what's gonna happen to your business at that point? See, I can have different tones within the same sentence or the same question that's going to trigger them differently. How does it sound if I said this? So that consequence question I just gave you was like if you were a marketing agency just a second ago. But let me go back to the same example. John, let me ask you. What happens if you don't do anything about this and you keep getting these low quality leads to your salespeople and they leave you for your competition? What happens to your business at that point? Oh, I don't know. I mean, we just hire different people. Like, I don't think they're gonna leave. Because you're not triggering any you're not getting them to think deeper about the consequences. You're saying the question monotone, and you're saying it too fast. The biggest reason why prospects give salespeople vague, generalized surface level answers is you ask the question so fast, you literally give them no time to internalize what you just asked. You just ask it too fast. Now notice how I ask the question somewhat fast, but you notice how there's like little verbal pauses in between. Why do I do that? Because it keeps the prospect engaged. But what happens if you don't do anything about this? You keep getting these, like, low quality leads, then your salespeople keep getting recruited by those other companies. I mean, what's gonna happen to your business at that point? See the verbal pauses, I verbal pace the question out. I'm still saying certain things fast for that reason because I'm when I use a challenging tone, I can't have a challenging tone and ask the question really slow. Right? I have to ask it fast, so I have to put verbal pauses in between certain things I want their brain to focus on. Okay? A lot of nuances there if you wanna be great at sales. The other thing is you've got the more challenging, more aggressive tone for the things that they know they don't like. Yeah. What are you gonna do if you keep getting these bad quality leads? Yeah. But then you soften it with the concerned tone when you think of the thing they wanna protect, which is what's gonna happen to your business then? Yeah. Yeah. It's that downward inflection. So you start off with a challenging tone on that consequence question because it raises their emotion of like, oh, shit. I don't want that to happen. But then you lower your voice into that soft tone like you just did, where at the end, they feel like you're generally concerned for the consequence, which you are. I wanna make sure everybody understands that this is not acting. You are concerned if they don't solve this problem because that would suck. Totally. So last tone. We've got those four. What's number five? The last tone is the playful tone. The playful tone is is really important because let's say, okay. So let's say, Nick, role play with me again. Let's say you jump on Zoom five minutes late and you're like, oh, I'm so sorry I'm late. You're a prospect. Jeremy, I'm sorry I'm late. Crazy day. Let's let's see what you got. Well, what are we gonna do with you? Should I forgive you this time? Yeah. I guess. Alright. I'm I'm okay. I'm just making sure. Don't worry. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna tag you on Instagram saying that you were late to the appointment. Now see, that's a playful tone. Now what happens is Nick starts laughing. Now why that's important? I'm not doing that to be a comedian or to be funny. Yeah. I'm doing that because I'm literally getting him to release dopamine in his brain, which causes you to laugh and lower your guard. That's a playful tone. I feel like what you're also doing in that scenario, Jeremy, is you're sort of you're not inferior. You're sort of keeping your status the same as the customers. Well, most salespeople, they they would get on there, like, oh, don't worry. I'm so grateful that you came here that we can have the time with you to discuss our never ending greatest opportunity in the world. And the prospects, like, that just lowers your status because that means in their brain, psychologically, that you value their time far more than they should value your time. And that's not where you want to be as lower status salesperson. Well, Jeremy, speaking of time, the clock is ticking, and we gotta move to our last question. So our last question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now we're gonna flip that question on a TED and ask you about a shouldn't. So my last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Getting defensive when the prospect gives you a concern. If you get defensive when a prospect gives you a concern or if you try to cut them off in the middle of a concern. So it's better for you to, like, even clarify why they have oh, what what caused you to feel that way? Just so I understand. It's almost like you're a psychologist, and you're just letting them dump their concern on you. And a lot of times, you'll find after they just dump it out, it's like they don't have the concern anymore. But it's easier for you to address it once you understand what the actual concern is. Because if Russia says, you know, this this proposal is just too expensive. Well, what does that even mean? Too expensive to what? Too expensive like they don't have the funding or budget for it? Too Too expensive, like, they don't have the money for thirty days? Too expensive that they've got other quotes that yours is more expensive? Too expensive that their current vendor is less than yours? Like, you don't even know what that means. So I simply would ask, oh, how do you mean by it's too expensive? Well, I was looking at another vendor and see, now I know what they mean by too expensive. So a lot of times we just need to ask a clarifying question first so we actually understand what the real objection is or what's behind the objection. And then it's really easy once you know what the objection is instead of guessing to help them overcome it. That's a huge mistake we see a lot of salespeople do. Phenomenal. Jeremy, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It is time for a two by two recap from this episode with Jeremy Lee Miner. What do you have for your two? My first one is that your facial expression is the remote control for your tone. If you wanna sound concerned, you may need to lean in. If you want to sound curious, you might need to tilt your chin up and have a bit more of a duck tone at the end of what you say. So use your face to get the right tone out of your voice. Number two is one of the biggest reasons you get crummy answers to your questions from prospects is that you ask your question too quickly, and it doesn't give them time to process and think. So what Jeremy recommends is to actually slow down the back half of your question to give your prospect a little more time to think through an actual response that gives you the actual information you're looking for. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Number three. Jeremy gave us the five types of tone. The first was a curious tone, which he uses to get people to tell him a little bit more about something. The second is a confused tone, which he'll oftentimes use when someone says, you know, we're really stressed about something. He'll get them to expand on a feeling. The third is a concerned tone, which he'll oftentimes use when asking pretty tough questions around how would you pay for the mortgage if you ended up passing away. The fourth is a challenging tone, which is when you're trying to push on someone to take action. And then the last is a playful tone, when you're oftentimes using to build rapport without lowering your status. And then lastly, number four, let's zoom in on the challenging tone. Jeremy's challenging tone sounds like this. Nick, how are you going to deal with the fact that your sales reps keep getting these low quality leads? You're not hitting the sales targets. Boom, boom, and boom. If this stuff keeps happening, what's gonna happen to your business? What he does is he pushes the things that are frustrating Nick, the prospect, but then he softens the blow and he ends in a softer down tone when he asks what it actually means for your business, and that's a non cringey way to ask an impact question. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? We talked a lot about tone in this episode, and tone is probably the most important on cold calls because you're making a very flash impression with your prospect. Luckily, Armand, you and I wrote a book about cold calling. And if you wanna get the audiobook version of it, even if you picked up the physical copy, you can actually hear the tone for every single element of that book because Armand and I got in a studio together for eight and a half hours to make sure we were voicing over the way you say things on a cold call. So there's a link in the show notes to get the audiobook of Cold Calling Sucks, and That's Why It Works, a step by step guide to calling strangers in sales. Pick it up. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
