## Transcript

It's Morgan j Ingham. Yes. I've hacked the show. And, hey, guys. We're doing a thirty minutes of Prejudice Club playbook, and I'm also part of the club, former sales trainer for Google, Slack, and Salesforce. So now what are we talking about today? Breaking down a cold call in ten minutes. I'm I'm gonna introduce the fisherman's framework. Everybody keeps telling me Cole Kong's dead. I think you're playing yourself, but I'm a teach y'all how to do that. The second part is an introduction so you don't get hung up on. The third thing is how to reverse engineer objectives of your personas so you can get inside their mind and talk to them appropriately. And then last but not least, which is the fight, which is handling objections and converting them so that you can have more opportunity to speak to your prospects. So here we go. Three, two, one. Let's get into it. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

I'll give you a quick little story, and then we'll get into how you can use this. So I don't know if y'all been fishing before. I've been a couple times. I'm not the best, but I've realized that fishing and cold calling are pretty much the same thing. You go out on a boat, on a river, lake, wherever you're at. You throw out your cast. You wait there for one to two hours. Fish bites the bait. You struggle with it. You don't even get the fish, and you're disappointed, and you just wasted two hours. And that's the same thing that happens on your cold calls. You call somebody. They hang up on you, then maybe you get a connection, but then you get hung up on as you try to talk to them and handle objections and doesn't work out. So this fish run framework will allow you to convert more opportunities, and let's talk about those three different stages. So the first stage that I talked about is the introduction. Right? So So you're making sure that you're there. So you're waiting. The second piece is the bite. Right? You've gotten someone to connect with you. And the third stage is the fight. So now you're handling those objections. So now let's get into the cold call step by step so you can convert more opportunities and feel more confident on the phone. So now we're gonna talk about the waiting. Right? You're making the calls. You're, oh, this person's not gonna pick up the phone. And let's say they do pick up the phone. Now while you're waiting, this is not the time to just be hanging out and hoping things go well because that is a terrible strategy. Hope it's not a strategy. Shout out to Roger Jefferson for that one. So what we're gonna do here is we're gonna have two introductions that we can use immediately to convert. Now if you're an avid listener of the thirty minutes of presence club, which I know y'all are, you probably heard this one before. It was just the PLA, but I'll keep it super sweet for y'all so you can use it. It stands for pleasant, laughing, arms up. So let's say I decide to call Nick. I'm cold calling him. And I say, hi, Nick. Thanks for taking my call. I know I'm calling out the blue here. However, do you have a few moments to chat? And the reason I do that is because the first part is pleasant. Most people are not getting thanked for the cold call at all, so that's why I say that. The second part is a laugh, so I create levity. People feel more approachable to me. And if I can get a laugh, then I win. My only caveat is don't sound like quiet litter. Don't be like, oh, yeah. I'm cold at the blue. Like, that's how you lose opportunities, and I'm not telling y'all to do that. The glass part is the arms up. Now this is a psychological body framing, and the reason for it is it makes you feel, and to the prospect, unassuming. So they're gonna be more willing to hear you out and more willing to have the conversation. So that is the PLA. Try it out. It works really well with a lot of clients I speak to. Now here's a new one. Y'all haven't heard this one before. The confident pause. Like, Morgan, what are you talking about? Do I just sound like a mute? Am I a mime on these calls? No. So what you're gonna do is they pick up the phone, and this is all I would do. Say, hi, Sally. This is Morgan from a century media productions. And I don't say anything. Now the thing is y'all be like, wait, what? The thing is the pause. Now you hold that conversation. You are now the confident one. You're actually holding the power there because you're just saying, hey. What's up? Here's my name. Here's my company. Don't say anything. Then they're like, like, what do you want? Right? And that's what that's what you want them to say. So now you can go into your value prop. Now you can go into what you wanna say, and I've actually seen a lot of people seen massive success with that. You don't even have to say your company name or name, but I know we have some international users here. So you might want to use that across the board, but that gives you an example. The confident pause, don't say anything at all. They're gonna be like, wait. What do you want? And then you go into your value prop, which leads us into this next point. So we've been waiting, casted out our our rod. Now we have a fish to bite. We got a prospect that wants to talk to us. Now we gotta get into it. But the question is, what do you do there? Right? This is where I like to talk to people about reverse engineering. And you probably hear about reverse engineering a lot, but we don't talk about reverse engineering our personas. Typically, in most organizations, you have three to five main buying personas that you speak to. So let's say it's a VP of marketing, CMO, digital marketing manager, and head of content, and maybe say head of demand gen. So what I'm doing is I'm taking that information that typically they deal with on a day to day basis, their problems, their challenges, their objectives, and now I'm creating cold calling value props around that. Best way to find that out is to go on a careers page. You could go Google it. I mean, Google Google's helpful. I don't know. ChatGPTs, they're they're pretty lit sometimes too, so you could go check them out as well. But the goal is you're gonna get all that information, and then you're gonna create value props out of that. Now you may be asking, but how do I do more than that? This is where I bring in the foundational pillars. So the pillars are case studies, or I like to call them better customer quotes, because you're not going to be able to pull out a whole case study on a cold call. That's for the discovery and later down the line. We just wanna get something really quick and a snippet. So we're gonna get these pillars to use that. The pillars are the foundations of the persona. So you should have a VP of marketing quote, a CMO quote. You should have a head of demand gen quote, and they should also be in the industry as well. So now that you have reverse engineered this buyer persona, you've also have a pillar you now could reach out to them. So let's say I've thrown out my cast and rod. Like I said, I'm on a call, and I wanna say my value prop after I did my confident pause from earlier. So I'd be like, hey. Our our solution focuses on helping VPs of marketing with their demand generation strategy as they're looking to elevate their content. And we recently just talked to a, VP of marketing, and they told us when they implemented our system, they were able to see a 30% increase in the social lift across all their platforms, which led to more conversations which generated revenue. So that'd be an example. Right? So I'm just taking a customer quote. I'm inserting it in there. It's in their language. I didn't really say anything crazy. And then I also addressed the problem of something they're looking to do. So I mentioned a priority there, but it also could be a pain point where it's, hey. A pain point is that we do webinars, but we're not getting any leads from it. Right? So that could be another example I could use as well. So we waited. They bit. Now we're fighting. Well, not like actual fight club and things that it should, but we're fighting with the fish. Right. I don't know if you ever got fishing before. Now we're fighting with, like, we're trying to get it back in the boat. Right. And we're so close, but we have a couple of things that we need to do here. So the first thing that you ought to do is a mindset shift. This is incredibly important. This is human nature. This is the laws of how things work, so you can't refute what I'm about to say. Fight or flight. When you're in a situation that it creates anxiety or pressure, you're either gonna fight or gonna flight. However, there's a third position most people don't talk about, which is standing your position. You don't move. You're calm. You're unbothered. This has taken me years to get here. By the way, this is not something that happens overnight, but if you practice it, you just become unbothered, unattached. And a lot of people talk about detaching for the outcome. But this thing I want you all to remember is standing your position. You look right into the eyes of this prospect, and you are gonna stand your ground. You're not gonna get emotionally tied up into this. So now that you have the mindset of I'm gonna stand my ground, I'm not gonna fight or flight, and I'm gonna choose that third position, the next thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna follow this framework. Pause, acknowledge, ask a question. So, typically, I do about a one second to one point five second pause, and then I acknowledge what's going on. So someone's like, hey. Reach out in six months. I'll pause. Absorb it. I'll say, hey, completely understand that you wanna talk to us in six months. I've been hearing a lot with a lot of clients lately, but I have a follow-up question. What's gonna happen between now and then that's preventing us from meeting today? Okay. So now I'm in a dialogue because that's a brush off. That's not a real objection most of the time. We need to identify that. So the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to pull them in. Right? So they're gonna say, you know what? Yeah, Morgan. Like, we got a website coming out. We're hiring new people. We got a little stuff going on, etcetera. Like, there's just so much happening. So I'd be like, hey, and this is just if we got the right pain points, I'd be like, based on the conversation we've got so far, you're saying six months? Based on our our solution, it's gonna take us probably two to three months to do a discovery, analyze what's going on, to then do an effective rollout for you maybe at at the fourth month here. So by the time I talk to you in six months, there's probably gonna be another additional four to five months before we can implement this. And in my scenario, based on the information you gave me, that might be too late. Would it be crazy for us to at least chat in the next couple of weeks to see if this is a potential fit? And if not, we could part ways as friends. Now I pulled them in because they're like, okay. Woah. Yeah. If I wait that long, it might be a year before I implement this. Now the conversation has changed, and now I'm gonna talk about the next steps. Now, again, this is not always gonna go this way, but here's the example of what should happen. They'll be like, hey. You know what, Morgan? That sounds fair. I'll meet with you in two weeks. And then now you're pushing it. You're saying, hey. Great. Typically, these scenarios when people look to meet in two weeks, I like to book a call with them and get you scheduled with our account executive who's gonna walk you through exactly the same case scenario that you just told me about. So now we've locked the meeting in, and now we're good to go. So hopefully, y'all understand what I just broke down and how to reel the fish in or, in this case, reel the future client in. So now let's do a recap. Right? Because I said a whole lot, but now let's recap it. So fisherman's framework, waiting, bite, fight. When you're waiting, make sure that you have the right openers. I gave you two openers, the PLA and also that confident pause. You got to have swag with it. You can't just be pausing awkwardly. You got to have some confidence with that. Then value props with the bite. Right? Reverse engineering those value props, reverse engineering those pain points, and then adding in those foundational pillars as customer quotes, and then objections. Right? Pause, acknowledge question, whatever they say. Now we're pulling them in to drive the next steps. Now hopefully y'all enjoyed that framework, but the thing is, if you if you know me or maybe you're new to me, I'm a huge fan of some frameworks. And we drop that weekly in my newsletter at The Commission. So if you wanna go check it out, come click the link, check it out there. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger.
