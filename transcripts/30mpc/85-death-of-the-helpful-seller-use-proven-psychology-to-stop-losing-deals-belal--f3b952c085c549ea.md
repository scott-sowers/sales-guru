## Transcript

Good morning, everybody. Welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Armand Frog. I'm here with my co host, Nick Segalski. And today, we have the first ever round three with Bilal, the one and only king of death to fluff. Nick, why don't you people listen? Armand, I used to take pride in being a helpful salesperson. I would love to put together a proposal for you. It would be my pleasure to show every single member of your team a one on one demo in the next month. But it turns out we shouldn't be helpful anymore, and Bilal teaches us why. Three. Three. Three. Three. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, Bilal. Welcome back for the third time to thirty minutes to presidents club. I hope that you know by now we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Alright. So number one, loss aversion over gains. This is prospect theory. It actually won a a a Nobel Prize in economics years ago, and you have to drill this into your head as a seller. Your buyers are gonna be motivated by the fear of loss, not the pleasure of gain. So you'll commonly see in, like, sales messaging some seller being like, you know, we help generate 300% ROI for our customers. And it's like, that's not what they care about. What if they didn't get that 300 ROI? What is the opportunity cost of sticking with the status quo? So flip it on its head and talk about what you stand to lose, not the time you've spent you can gain or or the money that you could save, but the money you could be wasting if you do it this way instead of the way we offer. So get that loss aversion into your messaging. Beautiful. What's number two, Bilal? The number two is about emotionally charging messaging. So this ties very well with number one. So, really great copy uses certain words that, like, trigger the limbic brain of your buyer and get them kind of emotionally involved. And you'll see, like, restaurants doing this when they talk about, for example, like, sizzling fajita poppers. And it's like there's a couple action words in there. They're like, oh, sizzling, like, brings that idea of that that plate being hot and delicious. Or, like, they don't just say it's, like, fudge, but they call, like, creamy hot fudge. And you're like, oh, the creamy part. Yeah. That's I'm into that. That's my thing. So this sort of, action words, you need them in in your prospecting as well as a seller. So here's an example. If you're gonna do loss aversion and you're gonna say something like, CFOs typically overspend on interchange fees when they're dealing with, credit card processing. Instead of saying that, yeah, it's a loss aversion statement. It's certainly better than saying we can help you save on your interchange fees. Let's emotionally charge it. CFOs get pissed off when they find out they're spending up to 30% more than they need to on interchange fees. That's emotionally charged. That word pissed off is now getting in there, and we all know what it's like to be pissed off about overspending. So now you can emotionally charge your messaging when you start talking about loss aversion, and you're gonna see response rates go up because that's the sort of stuff people respond to. Beautiful. Round us out. Give me a sizzling tip for number three. Yeah. So number three is this idea about social bids. Okay? So this comes from the Gottman Institute, and John Gottman is a legend. He was the first one to ever pioneer an actual statistical model to determine if people are gonna stay married or not. And he was so good at this that he was able to sit with a couple for less than five minutes and with 92% accuracy, tell them if they are gonna stay married or not. That's how good he was at it. And one of the pioneers of this statistical model was something called social bids. When we reach out and try to make an offer to somebody and the likelihood of that person responding, showing reciprocity to that offer and returning in kind. So here's the thing. We don't get taught this in sales, but this is a selling superpower. You can do this too when dealing with your buyers. Now social bidding is very different between obviously a husband and a wife or a married couple. But when you do it in a sales process, here are the things that you can do social bids on. Pricing, competition, implementation, and product shortcomings. These are things that your buyers are expecting you not to give them, that they're gonna have to, you know, pull it out of you. Now, if you offer that freely and openly, you're unexpectedly delighting your buyer with information that they never saw coming from you. Because sellers don't talk about those things. Really powerful. And what you're gonna trigger is a very fundamental psychology principle of reciprocity. When you offer information freely and openly, they feel compelled to share information too. I've been doing this for years and I can tell you guys I've had literally my buyer reading to me from their Slack a thread with some decision maker because I openly shared information about pricing or competition, and they're telling me, wow, that had just come up. Here's what somebody else had shared with me. I could have not gotten that question no matter how many onion layer questioning things I did or, you know, discovery hacks that I did. I got it because I triggered the law of reciprocity in my buyer. And so below, I've probably used the delighting your buyers tactic more than possibly any other tactic that I've ever heard on 30 MPC, giving price when they actually ask for it, saying, hey. This is the toughest part of implementation. The one place where I sometimes have a hard time is I have some really good competitors, and I know exactly where to hit them. And I'm so tempted to just be like, look. They're good here, but we are way better here. And so what is a better way to handle competitors without throwing mud or sounding like a So, one of the best things you could do, for example, is, like, how your competition prices. Right? So if they do something different than you do, if they talk about something very specific that your product doesn't, you lean in on that and be like, this is where they focus. They think this is just how to solve that problem. We believe in a fundamentally different approach. Right? And you create a fork in the road road and force your buyer to decide which side of this issue do they think is right for them. So a classic example of this was when I was selling session replay, we had a competitor that was really, really heavy in AI. Our product did not have AI. It just did machine learning. And the argument that I would make was this AI applies generically to every single type of customer that they have. Whether you're an ecommerce company, whether you're a SaaS product, you get the same generic out of the box AI, and it's not designed to learn. Instead of going that route, we did a machine learning algorithm that actually looks at your data and changes based on the behavior, but doesn't apply any AI analytics to it. And I would tell people, like, which do you think is better for your business? Because each has their pros and cons. And now everything I said was verifiable because all of my competitors, like marketing and sales messaging and decks and all that stuff, were all built around this AI argument. So I sounded really informed and, like, I knew what I was talking about, buyer pick a lane. And once I knew where their mindset was at, that made me decide whether they're actually really a buyer, if they're a prospect. Right? Are they just window shopping? They're not sure yet? Or have they really deeply thought about the problems that they have and see a path on how they could fix it? Because that's not my job. Right? Like, you know, at the end of the day, my buyer needs to come with the willingness to change themselves. I can't I can't do that for them. So I wanna pull that out of them and be like, do you really have a desire to change, and do you think the change should be this or that? Well, what you're doing in that scenario is you're saying, hey. There's two ways to solve this problem, but the two different paths are fundamentally different. And what happens is you're no longer competing with this person. You're saying, let's figure out which way is right for you. And if ours is it, like, we're the best path there. Can you talk about that sort of, like, understanding their willingness to change piece? Because I know a lot of salespeople who waste a lot of time on buyers who are just window shopping, and they end up neglecting deals that could have been real deals, but they fail to recognize which was which. So the willingness to change phase comes in the fact that when people buy, they typically do not buy in isolation. They try to build consensus. And in that consensus building, they try to take in different people's opinion. They don't wanna piss someone off. Right? Another thing that people typically do when they buy is they not only think about their their own goals, but they think about their own, like, self worth. Like, will this make me look better? Will this alienate people that I work with? Will people respect me more if I make this decision? So that's always a big piece of any purchase. And and, again, where does that get factored into BANT or MEDDIC or MEDDPIC? It doesn't exist. Right? There's no fields for that in Salesforce. But that's something you gotta be thinking about, the politics and how it works for your buyer when they're making a decision like this. And then another big piece of it too comes down to the fact that no purchase is gonna get made unless your buyer can pull together the resources necessary to make it work. Right? Like, you can't will the budget for them. You can't sit there in, like, this dream that you can, you know, get in front of the decision buying committee and just convince them. It's their job to do that. It they are the hero, not you. And you have to be Merlin giving them the magic sword to go slay the dragons, not trying to be the hero yourself. So as you do this in the sales cycle, you pressure test these moments of willingness to change. Like, would you be willing to bring in others on the next meeting to talk about this? Do you have in mind a set of people that you plan to share the documentation with that's gonna help move this forward? Are you specific on a critical event that's the deciding point on when we're gonna make this decision? Are you kind of like, oh, I don't know. We can I guess we could do this this year, or we can also do this in q one next year? And it's like, that's not a very firm willingness to change. Right? So you can sess some of this out, but in order to do so, you can't be the helpful seller. So the helpful seller is the one that says things like, oh, I'd I'd love to follow-up with an email with you in in two months' time and see how things are going. I wanted to circle back with you and see how things are going, you know, any updates that you can share, trying to be this helpful seller. Oh, I can totally provide the documentation for you for these sort of things. Like, no. You don't wanna do that unless they're serious about buying. You know? You know it. I know it. Say that. Tell them that. You know? Nick, I honestly, the last thing I wanna do is write an email that you're not gonna read. You know, when you mentioned right now that you're not sure about the critical event for this purchase, whether it could be this year or next next year in q one, that makes me think that maybe there's some discussions that you should probably have internally before we get into anything too deep. Would you rather do that first? And that way, it could spare me sending an email you're not gonna read and me having to write it. Now I'm, like, making you tell me if you really do have that willingness to change because I'm telling you, I don't wanna be a part of this if you don't. I'm totally okay. You're not gonna hurt my feelings, but please don't think I'm interested in selling you if you're not ready to buy. I don't have any intention to do so. Balel, I sort of understand the consensus thing. Like, if they're not pulling other people into the evaluation or there's not other people who are looking at this initiative that you probably don't have a deal. But I'm kinda curious. You talked about, like, the perception of their own self worth. Like, what's in it for me if we make this initiative happen? How do you start to pressure test that if they've actually been considering that? Because I imagine if someone isn't, they probably don't have a deal. This that's actually a really good question, Nick, because this so this comes up okay. So if we go back to social bidding so if you're social bidding and you're doing it right, you're telling them about pricing. You're telling about competition. You're telling about implementation. You're telling them about your product shortcomings. In the first meeting, you're setting that tone on how the relationship will be, and you're getting the reciprocity from them. Typically, what happens is when I do it successfully, my buyer shares with me a very emotionally charged story. I'll give you an example of what happened recently. I'm doing my social bidding just as described. And somewhere at the end of the call, the VP of sales tells me, you know what? I got a particular person in mind. I asked him, who's that person? What's their name? And just for the sake of it, they said their name is Tom. Like, okay. Tell me about Tom. Right? He's like, Tom started. I really like him. I think he's great. Okay? I asked him yesterday, hey, man. Just between you and I, really, how long did it take you to feel fully comfortable with what we sell, who we sell to, and all that sort of stuff? And he told me probably last week. He's been at the company for six months, and only as of last week did he really finally feel comfortable with what they were doing. And that VP of sale felt like that was a real loss. Like, why did it take us so long to equip this person who I like, who I think can do the job, who has done an admiral job throughout their time at the company already. And I think that they can be a big part of what we're gonna do moving forward. It took them six months just to get comfortable. So my buyer's telling me the story. And what I'm hearing is that personal value to them. They're buying my product to solve something that they feel is a defense deficiency in their leadership. I'm not equipping the people that I care about on my team to be successful. That's what I'm hearing. That's perfect. That's a personal motivation. Now I see that there's a real willingness to change because I'm gonna, you know, dig the dagger on that. If he ghost me at any point in time, which he won't, I know he won't because our because the fact that he he returned my bids with that bid, that kind of information tells me that he's engaged. That's something I'm gonna use to the sales process. I'm gonna go back to Tom. The ROI sheets and calculators, the the unique selling propositions, the all that stuff is gonna be secondary to the next Tom's success. That's what's gonna win me the deal because that's a relationship that that VP of sales cares about deeply. Right? So that's what it sounds like when you get that out of them, and that's how you know you have willingness to change. When they start telling you those sort of things that transcend the normal spreadsheet stuff. So, Bila, when I'm talking about things that are tough, like, people will ask me, I've gone through HR implementations. You've gotta integrate with all my systems. Like, I really wanna know what I'm in for. The tough part is I know my competitors are probably promising four weeks, and I know it's gonna take me at least ten. How do I soften the blow or deliver it in a way that doesn't just sound like implementation sucks, you're gonna have to deal with it? Well, so implementation is, again, one of those things that you can pressure test the willingness to change. That's what the the beauty of this is every social bid category, again, it's it's pricing, competition, implementation, and product shortcomings, are pressure testing willingness to change. So if I'm being really open and and that might be how I say it. Right? I might be like, look. My competition typically can do this in four weeks. I know this because I'm an experienced seller. I know my competition. We take 10. Here's why. First of all, let me explain to you why. It's because of this. We do something different than them. That's why there's an extended period. Let me just before I even continue, thoughts on that. Is that is that for you, like, something you find you have the resources for internally, or is that right off the bat a deal break? And now I'm making you share with me your willingness to change. No. We don't have the resources for that, or it might depend. I mean, I like what you guys do. So it might take longer, but if there's value for us, we'll make it work. Now they're selling themselves, and you're like, that's exactly what I want. I want you convincing yourself that this is the right thing to do. And by just being transparent and blunt, I get that from you because I'm, again, I'm triggering that law of reciprocity. I'm being giving, so you're gonna give back, and you're gonna tell me what's really going on. So it feeds itself. So if you have something like that, you get to, a, sound informed as a seller by noting something that's different between you and your competition. B, you're offering it up unexpectedly, which is gonna trigger a social bid and a response. And then, c, they're probably gonna disclose something that you would have never found out anyways. And now that's part of that puzzle of, like, do they have the willingness to change? Is this really a buyer, or is this a prospect? Because a prospect considers things. A buyer evaluates things. I want evaluators, not consideration. So I guess one more question about implementation. You talked about it being something that we need to openly share, and there's a lot of information that I could be sharing about implementation. And so I don't want on the very first date to, like, sit down and be like, here's all the logistics of what our wedding is going to look like. Are you in for that? Because it's a lot of work planning a wedding. When I'm talking about implementation, what are the key points that I need to communicate with a buyer so that they feel like I have been helpful in the good way? It sounds something like this. It'd be something like, listen, Nick. This product doesn't just it's not like a light switch. We're not gonna just flip it on. It's gonna work. You know? There is some setup to do this. I wanna be transparent about that. So here are the things that typically are needed for implementation. There's a bit of time. There's a bit of resources, and there's a couple players that need to be involved. It looks something like this. I'm just giving you the very general lay of the land. Not into the details. Not gonna pull up an implementation timeline just yet and bore you with all that, be you. You're probably gonna need to ask a friend or this isn't just gonna be like a one week turnaround. This might be multiple weeks spread out and we'll do different things in that time. Share that with you. And I'd be like, have you already thought about that? Is that something that you've maybe already planned for? Or is that something that you're gonna need to go and talk to somebody else about? And odds are you're gonna give me now a real honest answer instead of a fake answer because I just disclosed what it really takes to do this. I made the bid. So, again, your brain's gonna go, I gotta respond. I gotta tell him because he told me the real thing, so I need to respond in kind. And now I get to ask you hard questions. Now I've earned the right to beg, who is that person you need to go seek? What's their schedule like? Do you really think you can get this done by January? Because what I'm hearing, Nick, is that it might not. And now I get information again that 21 questions of discovery would not have gotten. One way you can tell where you're gonna land in negotiation is how much people have invested in the deal or how much time they've invested in you or what they've shown you they're willing to do prior to that negotiation. And, essentially, what you're doing is you're pushing on all these walls, and you're trying to see which one is gonna give you a little bit of pressure back. And you know those are your real deals. And so you get to the negotiation phase. You've gotten all of these things from your social bidding. But still, for some reason, someone is asking you for a 30% discount. What do you do in that moment to bring some of that stuff back without just using all of their own information against them directly? Yeah. Like the like the Tom story of that rep and that very personal connection that the VP feels to him and how he feels he failed him. I'm a 100% bringing that up. I'm a 100% bringing that up. You know, if that VP tries to negotiate with me and I'd be like, first, I'm gonna ask what what's compelling and negotiate and and and just context wise, negotiations don't happen in in in some sort of isolated chamber. Right? They're contextually related to something else. You're trying to ask for a discount. Why? Is it because you saw other pricing somewhere else, so you're thinking this is too high? Is it because you generally have a budget to stay within and you're trying to make this work? Is it because you're just trying to look good by getting a better deal? That's the popcorn pricing solves that one. Right? The for our first episode, popcorn pricing solves making them feel like a winner. You know? Wherever they land on the board, you've set it up for success for yourself and them. So that part should be taken off. But if people don't know the popcorn pricing, that also will come up too. So you need to know where what what's triggering the negotiation. Why do they think that this discount needs to be applied? But then once you get the context as to why, that's when I go right back into, like, well, listen. I think at the end of the day, no matter what price point we land at, this was always about Tom. This is about avoiding what you had told me was a major issue that you didn't wanna see happen again. And if if if we reach this point and you still don't think that we can address that, I wouldn't even give you this thing for a dollar. These are when I get to use all my chips and put them in and be like, I'm all in. Are you? Or did I do something wrong here and miss the mark? And, again, that typically gets a very good response from people, and they'll tell me what's really happening. And it has happened in times where people are like, we don't have the budget that I thought I had. Okay. Let me work with you with the budget you do. Like, you know, this lie that people say that, like, budget's not an objection. Like, yeah. It is. Have you ever seen a company's budget? They really do commit to numbers. It's not a made up thing. You know? They don't have endless money. It's not true. Most of the stuff that people sell has to fall in line in some level of a budget. So it's okay if that happens. I just need to know it's real. It's so intelligent what you're doing there where when somebody comes to you to negotiate. Like, one of the things we always talk about is, like, stop the bleeding right away, and you're actually doing a step even before you stop the bleeding of the discounts is you're asking what is prompting you to negotiate right now because the answer to that question is going to inform your behavior next. If it's a budget or billing terms thing, okay, let's have a let's have a conversation about how we can make this work. We're no longer fighting each other. We're trying to solve that specific departmental issue together. If they saw pricing somewhere else, like, you have a different answer. I'm curious. Like, let's say you have a really good relationship with Arman. And if I were ever selling something to him, I know it's ingrained in his DNA. He's gonna ask me for a discount because it's part of his culture. He wants to get a better deal. And so if Arman says to me, look, man, I just want a better deal. I need a better deal to make this work. Like, it's it's me. How do I respond to to sort of that negotiation tactic? So if somebody's negotiating pricing on you and they're saying something like that, like, I just want a better deal, it's like, that's on you, not them. They you did not build the perceived value necessary. You should have maybe done decoy pricing and offer them two options. One that was an overpriced bare bones version, and then the one that they actually wanted, that was only incrementally more. And now they're thinking, oh, I'll have to just put in two k more and get everything I want. That's easy. And now you you're you're negotiating on two k instead of the total value of a deal of 20 or 30 k. But if you fail to do that, which just happens. Right? It happens. You didn't do the decor pricing. You didn't set it up. And now you're in this scenario. The person is saying, I just want a better deal. Right? Now I'm thinking to myself, again, this goes back to them wanting to feel like a winner. This is a personal thing. It's not professional anymore. This isn't about the company or, you know, uptime or or or, you know, making sure that it checks the box on the integration. This is something that they want personally. Okay. Let me give them that. Let me give them that. But I won't give them exactly what they want. I'll tell them, look. What you're asking me for is really hard. You know, I've I've tried throughout this process, Armand, to be really clear from day one about pricing, around my competition, around implementation. I've been trying to be forthcoming so that you have everything you need, and I feel a little flat footed hearing this from you now. I wanna make this work, but what you're asking for is too much. And I'm gonna pause. Right? I'm gonna fall back on, hey, man. I've been social bidding this whole time, and all of a sudden you're gonna hit me out of left field with something. I don't think it's fair. So you tell me why you need this. Prove to me why you need this. Now it's on you to justify this to me. Make me the business case. Like, we you were talking about it earlier. Like, some point, I need to switch it, and I'm not selling that anymore. They need to be selling me. And if I hear a really good business reason, I'm accommodating. Sure. That makes sense. But if I don't hear a good business reason, I'm like, I don't I don't see that working. You know? I I have to also save face internally. So if I do something like this, what is my team gonna think of me? What my manager is not expecting me to do this sort of stuff. So there's also a side to this, but I get to lean on that. I get I have the right now to say that because I've been bidding throughout the entire sales process. I've been making them the hero, and I've been playing Merlin. And I have to be like, hey. You're asking too much hero. This is not I can't do that. Bilal, the first episode was great. The second episode was better, and the third episode has been the best of them all. And it breaks my heart, but we are running out of time. And so we gotta move to the final question. Final question is this. We've talked about a ton of really good things that salespeople should be doing, and we're gonna ask you about the inverse now. So the last question is what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople doing that you think they need to stop doing because it hurts them a lot more than it helps? Yeah. I think it goes back to that helpful seller stuff. Like, I wanna be helpful. I'd love to share this with you. I'd love to do that for you. This, like, love word. Like, I just wanna ban the word love from the vocabulary of sellers. Like, you don't love doing that stuff. That's the grinding boring back end stuff that you don't wanna do, and you certainly don't wanna do it for somebody who's not gonna buy. And last time I checked, most of your deals don't close just like mine. And my win rate's only 20 something percent. Means the majority of what I do doesn't end up in in in victory. So I don't wanna be doing this. I don't I don't have any love. You know? And I and I I tell my buyers that. You know? I tell my buyers, like, look. Putting together this proposal is gonna take some time for me. I wanna make sure done, you feel like everybody's ready and willing to hear it, and you can bring everybody to the table. I'm not gonna say, oh, I'd love to do that. You know? No. I don't. There's no love. And it's okay to tell somebody that. That kind of bluntness really does work. Anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? As always, the death of fluff newsletter, deathoffluff.substack.com. Check it out. A lot of good psychology tips in there, like, that stuff from the Gottman Institute. They again, they don't teach that in your sales training, but it's really, really powerful stuff. And I am hiring. I am hiring. I I've joined a new startup called GTM Buddy. It's a new, sales tech platform. It's pretty cool. And I am hiring reps in India. So if you're listening and you're you're you're in India, please go to my my LinkedIn profile to see more about the job description. I will say this, by the way. I spent a lot of time on the job description. One thing that I did, guys, you might appreciate this. I went to the Sales Health Alliance who recently did, a study on mental health and sales, and they found seven categories that, in order of importance that matter in determining the health and productivity of a rep. And I pulled the top four that I thought were really critical, and I put them in the job description as a commitment from us to whoever takes this job. So we're really trying to to build something that is world class to operationalize excellence. So it's all on my profile. Folks, if you're listening to this and you have the opportunity to work with Bilal, I would say take it because he's one of the most conscientious sellers that I've ever worked with, but he's also a really, really good salesperson. And so if you wanna get better, he's a guy to work with. There's a reason that he's our first ever three time guest on thirty minutes to president's club. So everybody hit up Bilal. Thanks for listening, and stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Bilal round three include number one, you can delight your buyer in four ways with pricing, with competition, with weakness, and with implementation. Number two, social bidding. The more you do those things, the more prospects will share with you things that you're not supposed to know about their business. Number three, you can't convince the buying committee. However, you can pressure test how well your champion can convince the buying committee. In other words, you can suss out their real willingness to change by asking them, hey. What is that critical event you're driving towards? How are you going to help us multithread, etcetera? And then lastly, number four, you have emotionally charged messaging. You have things like talking about loss aversion instead of talking about all the features and benefits in your outreach. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Well, there's a reason Bilal came back for round three. It's because rounds one and two were so good. I highly recommend if you have not listened to his first episode where he talked about how pricing of popcorn at the movies relates to your SaaS, sales pricing. Go check that one out. And then the second one, he talked about some unexpected tips that you can delight your buyer, like when you go to a nice hotel and they leave a mint on the pillow so you can have fresh breath. Little things that put smiles on the faces of your buyers. So check those episodes out. Everybody, stick around next week for thirty minutes to president's club. See you.
