## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this book summary of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I am here with my cohost, cofounder, and now coauthor, Nick Sigelski. So we're gonna jump in. Here's what we got. The first question we answer in the introduction is, why would you even cold call at all? Is it even worth your time? And so we wanted to answer that question first. And what we did was we looked at the data with Gong, and we said, alright. If a salesperson makes an hour's worth of cold calls a day for a month straight, how many meetings do they book? We looked at the data for the average rep, the fiftieth percentile rep, and the seventy fifth percentile rep. So the pretty good reps, not the best in the world, but folks who were pretty good. And what we saw was for the average salesperson, cold calling's a pretty crummy use of their time. The average salesperson dials for an hour a day and makes 800 dials, and they end up connecting with just about five and a half percent of the people they call. So they get 43 live conversations. Of those, they book meetings with two of them. An hour a day of work for a month straight for two meetings is not a good use of time. But the story looks different for the seventy fifth percentile rep. They spend the same amount of time dialing. They make 800 cold calls. But on those same number of dials, they connect live with more than twice as many people. They get a 106 people live on the phone, and we will get into some of the things they do differently to increase their connect rate later in this session. Of those 106 people that they talk to, they book meetings with one in six of them. They end up getting team meetings from an hour's worth of work a day. The story gets even more exciting because the data from Gong also showed that when you cold call, even if you don't connect live, it almost doubles your cold email reply rates because your calls draw attention to your emails. An hour a day of work, 18 meetings, plus all of the extra responses you get on your cold emails make it extremely worth it. And you'll find today that it's actually not that hard to beat the average rep when the average rep is asking, did I catch you at a bad time? Or pitching in a way that sounds like a Billy Mays commercial. And so, folks, we are gonna break down how to beat the average in every single step of the cold call. First, you have to nail the first sixty seconds. That includes the way that you open a cold call and the way you describe the problem you solve prop. The first sixty seconds give you access to the rest of the call, and that's where we'll cover the mister Miyagi method for handling any objection. But there are also things that will prevent you from getting objections at all, such as gatekeepers or voice mails. Once you're done with sections one and two, that includes everything you will say on the phones. The reps who make it to Presidents Club are the ones doing the right activities off the phones. They dial smart. They maximize their dial conversion by optimizing their connect rates, their set rates, and their show rates. Then they make more calls than anyone else by dialing at the right time of day, and they make sure that they plan to dial every single day, and they structure their calendar like a machine. Step one is opening and getting the conversation in the first place. So we're gonna cover three things. What openers to not use, why most cold calls are lost in the first thirty seconds, the heard the name tossed around opener, which is my personal favorite, and the next personal favorite, the tailored permission opener. Awesome. So let's put ourselves in the shoes of your prospect for a second. 99% of the cold calls that your prospect receive come from pretty crappy telemarketers. These are people that are just blindly dialing through the phone book, pitching anybody who answers on their extended car warranties or loan forgiveness packages. And for your prospect to entertain those people is a total waste of their time. If you want your cold call to succeed, you've got to differentiate from those people. If your prospect thinks you are like those other telemarketers, you're gonna get rejected. And so that starts with the first words that come out of your mouth, which is why we've got two band openers that we'll show you the data on in a second that are not successful because they get you instantly categorized as a telemarketer. The first one is, did I catch you at a bad time? This one instantly says, hey. I'm a salesperson. I wanna pitch you. Is now a good time? Folks, you're making a cold call. You're interrupting their day. Of course, it's a bad time. But this also puts you in a very inferior position to the prospect as if they would be gracious enough to spare just a morsel of their time. So throw that one in the trash. The other opener that is banned is, hey. How's your day going, or how are you doing today? When you lead with false pleasantries like this, it kicks the call off on a sort of disingenuous note. Recall a list of 52 CIOs trying to book a meeting with them not to inquire about their day. And I know it, you know it, and your prospect knows it. The real reason this one fails is it's what every other seller says. Even if you truly care about their day, it doesn't matter because you sound the same as every other telemarketer. The only way to get out of that telemarketer stigma is to lead with something that cannot be canned, that cannot be used by other cold callers, and that's a context first opener. Two context first openers. And you'll see that the difference between the two context first openers, the tailored permission opener and the heard the name tossed around opener massively outperform the canned openers of did I catch you at a bad time and how's your day going? So did I catch you at a bad time has a 2.15% success rate. How's your day going? 7%. Tailored permission opener and heard the name tossed around opener each over 11% success rate. And the reason for that is even if there were a third better canned opener, like the permission based opener that sounds like, hey, Nick. I know this is a cold call. Could I get thirty seconds to tell you why I called? And then you can hang up from there. The problem is if a canned opener becomes popular, if a prospect's heard it before, they're immediately gonna lump you in with every other telemarketer. So you have to lead with something about them, which means your opener cannot be canned. That starts with the the heard the name tossed around opener. So here's how this works. For the heard the name tossed around opener, your goal is for them to forget that's a cold call. The way you're gonna do that is you're gonna show them that you work with other people in their space, and you're not a complete rando. And so you're gonna find something that your current customers have in common with your prospect. For example, when I was selling compensation software at Pave, I would say, hey. We work with a few other Sequoia portfolio companies. They shared the same investor. Or in this example, when I was selling life insurance to partners of law firms, I would say, we work with a few other partners in this Downtown LA office. And so the opener sounds like this. Hey, Bill. We work with a few other partners in the Scott in LA office. It's Arman from Northwestern. Have you heard her name tossed around? Even if they haven't heard our name before, you'll usually get an answer that sounds like, no. How can I help you? And that's okay. The reason for that is the entire demeanor of the call has changed because I didn't lead with my name, my company. I led with I work with other people that are similar to you in your office. To be clear, it doesn't matter if they've heard your name or not. 90% of the time, they will not have heard your name tossed around. I used this when I was a 20 year old, no name, selling insurance, and I used this when I was the ninth employee at Pave, and no one knew who we were. What matters is they know who your customer is, and that's the common thread. If they say no, act like they should have heard your name. Say, oh, I guess I'm not as popular as I thought. The reason I reached out is I work with a few other partners in the office, then drop into the problem you solve, which is the problem proposition. But in the off chance that they said yes, this is the beautiful part. You literally don't have to pitch. All you have to do is understand why they didn't move forward in the past. Say, oh, normally, we'd be working with someone like like you by now. I guess that'll get you to the objection, and then you can just have a conversation around why they didn't move forward in the past as opposed to just regurgitating the same pitch that they've already heard. So, again, to recap three steps, you lead with context, then you introduce yourself, then you ask if they've heard your name tossed around. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright. Next one. The next context first opener is called the tailored permission opener. And just like the heard the name tossed around opener, like, these are the contextual openers. Just like the heard the name tossed around opener, this one leads with context, but it actually differs in that it owns that is a cold call. If I'm selling billing software to law firms and I'm calling CFOs of law firms, I'm gonna say something like this. Armond's my prospect. He answers and he goes, hello? I'm gonna say, Armond, I just finished reading your press release about the new office opening in Tacoma. And I'm gonna be honest. This is a cold call, but it is a well researched one. I'm wondering if I can get half a minute to share why that press release prompted me to call you, and then you can totally hang up on me if it doesn't make sense from there. What I'm doing here is I am leading with the research that made me call this person. Then I'm disarming them with honesty by owning that it's a cold call and telling them exactly what I want, half a minute to share why that press release made me call them. I'm using the fact that I led with context and disarm them with honesty as a way to gain permission to get to my pitch. You don't have to reinvent the context or the research for every single prospect. My recommendation is you find things you can easily find about your prospects that you can relate to what you sell. So when I sold billing software to law firms, I would look for, did that law firm announce that they won a case recently? Because almost all of them would, and I can relate the billing software to they need to collect money. Or do they open a new office? Okay. That usually adds billing complexity. I can attach that to my pitch. You don't need to start from scratch with your leading with context with the TPO. Think of your common, what can I find that I can relate to what I sell? But this point, you've got your two openers that get you to the part of the call where you have to give your pitch and explain what you actually do. And there are three parts to breaking down what we call the problem proposition. Number one, why most value propositions and pitches that come from your team are absolutely horrendous. Number two, how you should lead with a problem proposition instead. And then number three, once they've agreed that they have the problem that you solve, how do you ask them for the meeting? Alrighty. Billy Mays time. Beautiful. So most salespeople have been trained that the key to being a really great seller is to have a great pitch, sometimes known as a value proposition. And their value propositions that most folks use sound something like, yeah. You know, Ping is an automated all in one billing platform that streamlines your client billing to help you save time and money. Or they'll say something like, Pave is a single pane of glass for all your HR transactions and data to allow you to be making data informed decisions when you're planning your comp for your employees. The problem with pitches like these, with value propositions like these, when you use buzzwords like automated or streamlines or all in one or single pane of glass, those words might mean something to you, but they don't mean anything to your prospect. They're a little too generic. They're not the words your prospect uses when they describe their problems or their solutions. The bigger problem with those buzzwords is they are the same things that every other cold caller is saying in their pitch. And we did all of this work with our context first opener to differentiate from the telemarketer. Now we're putting ourselves right back in that bucket by using those buzzwords. The biggest problem is that the value of our solution has zero contextual relevance to our prospect without a problem to attach it to. When I tell them we have an automated billing solution, in my mind, I know what that means. But to my prospect, they now need to do the heavy thinking of thinking, okay. What use would I have for an automated billing solution? There's a lot of data that shows people are more motivated to resolve pain than achieve gain. To get them to care about what we do, I'm gonna lead with the pain, with the problem that I believe they're experiencing to get them to care about the value of what we do, and that's called a problem proposition. Flip the value proposition on its head. The key is if you spend 80% of your time talking about the problem, that is what's going to demonstrate you as an industry expert that's not a rando that actually understands their space. If you think about anytime you've actually listened to one of your friends' advice, it's usually because the way that they started is they started by showing that they understood the problem you were in, not by just throwing a solution at you. From there, if you describe the problem in such specificity that is literally triggering, you only need to explain how you solve that problem in one sentence. And it usually sounds like we do this thing that allows us to solve that problem, and then ask if they're open to learning more. We're gonna do another role play here. This time, we're gonna use the example that I used over at Pave, and I might even go a little bit off script here just so you can get a sense that it doesn't always sound the same. And Nick Ring. Hello? Hey, Nick. We work with a few other, Sequoia portfolio companies. It's Arman from Pave. Have you heard your name tossed around? I don't think so. I guess I'm not as popular as I thought. I work with a few other Sequoia portfolio companies. Usually, when I'm talking to a head of people ops like you around merit season, you you can't breathe under the mountain of spreadsheets because you got all the tabs and columns that go all the way to q z, and it's a complete mess. I work with a a lot of other folks in the portfolio, and they use Pave to consolidate their equity data, their HRIS data, and their comp data all into one place. You never have to run merit cycles on spreadsheets again. My guess is you're totally good here, Nick, but are you open to taking a look at this thing just so you know it's out there? I spent 90% of my time in problem world. That was the vast majority of the talk time. The key here is most people screw up the triggering problem. They think they're being specific, but they're actually just saying things like people hate merit cycles or working in spreadsheets takes too long. I always tell my reps, you want hairy lollipop specificity. Imagine you're licking a dumb lollipop and you're walking around. You're licking the dumb lollipop, and you accidentally drop your lollipop. And that lollipop falls flush inside of a shag rug, and you can see the bristles wrapping around the lollipop. And then you give it a nice little twirl, and then you hold up that lollipop to the light. What do you see? Someone's gonna get it. You've got a six It's gross. Fur. Hair off of Fur. From your dog. You see hair from the lollipop. It is so obviously specific that you can see the scenery of the problem. That's the degree of specificity that you want. Alrighty? So we're not selling at Lollipop cleaner. Unfortunately, we're selling software in this case. So, Nick, walk us through a more practical example. We're selling something even more exciting, billing software. We need to make the problem specific that our prospect can see that same hairy lollipop. Because when they see the problem and when we bring them back to that really frustrating time, that gets them to sit up, and it earns us the right to tell them more about our solution. We're leading with a very triggering problem. Let's talk about how you can build said problem. What I have here is a base problem statement from when I used to sell billing software to law firms. The base problem statement might be, most CFOs tell us that billing takes a lot of time. That's not really a specific enough problem to get them to say, ugh, that's really frustrating. What I need to do is layer in different descriptors to make the problem more specific. Some examples are, I can add in the persona of either the person I'm calling or the type of company that I'm calling. So in this case, it's not just most CFOs. It's most CFOs of insurance defense law firms. Additionally, if I wanna build on it it further, I can add in the annoyances about why billing takes a lot of time. In this case, it was the deductions, rejections, and appeals. Now we're getting a better problem here. If I wanna layer in more, I can add the scenery, the time, the place, the conditions that the prospect would be experiencing when that problem came up. In this event, it was the deductions, rejections, and appeals from the insurance carriers right after they won a big case. If I really wanna hammer this thing home, I add the emotion. It's not they tell us that billing takes a lot of time. It's that they think it's ridiculous that billing takes a lot of time. You can see the difference between that last statement and the first one is dramatic. You do not need to add in every single descriptor here. But if you add in just a couple, it will make your problems more compelling and earn you the right to then tell them about how you solve said problem. And so at this point in the session, you've got a couple different context first openers that you can use to get to your pitch. And you now understand the attributes of a compelling problem proposition versus a value proposition. But unless you sell what Arman sold at Pave or billing software to law firms, these talk tracks won't work because you now need to make them your own. And one of the things we did in the book to make it the most usable cold calling book ever was we included homework and toolkits at the end of every chapter to make these scripts your own. If you scan that QR code I don't know. Armand, you might need to zoom in on it a little bit. We gave you a worksheet here to build your own heard the name tossed around opener, your own tailored permission opener, and to build your own problem proposition. So we'll give you all a second. If you wanna scan that code, you'll get that worksheet for free so you can build your own opener as well as a pitch. And three, two, one. Faster with the phones. Alrighty, folks. So at this point, now what's happened is you've opened the call. You've explained what you do. And nine times out of 10, you're gonna get an objection. It's almost surprising if you don't get an objection. You almost need to look them up on LinkedIn and make sure that they're actually still working for the company. And so we're gonna talk through first the mister Miyagi method to handle any objection. That starts with why most objections aren't really objections, which will imply how you think about them, which will imply the three steps that will take to handle any objection in the world. And then lastly, when and how you book the Great. So let's start with why most objections are not really real objections. We have to put ourselves in our prospect's shoes and use our empathy and think about your prospect's experience. When you cold call them, this is an unexpected, frankly, kind of unwelcome interruption right in the middle of their workday. And when they hear a stranger's voice on the phone asking that they've heard the name tossed around, for a second, it turns their brain it puts their brain into that fight or flight state where their logical part of their brain shuts off, and they're just trying to find a way to get off the phone as quickly as possible. And so what you'll see is most objections that your prospects say to you on a cold call, they're not logical, thought out, reasoned objections. They're actually reactions to the cold call. Another way to think about it is most of the objections that you get are not to what you sell. It's objections to the interruption of your cold call. So in order to overcome those, we need to find a way to get them out of that fight or flight state and to turn their brain back on and get them listening to us again. And so that's why the first step of the mister Miyagi method is to literally agree with the objection. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but if you just try to handle or fight the objection, they are not gonna listen to you. A lot of reps, if someone says I'm not interested, they're gonna start pitching or explaining all the reasons you should be interested. But instead, if someone says I'm not interested, I'm gonna say, this one's totally my bad. My my guess is you probably would have called us if you were. Or if Nick says I've got no budget, I'm gonna agree with it. I'm gonna say, honestly, Nick I hear you, man. Nowadays, it it's hard enough to keep your budget, let alone get something new. When I say something like that, it's literally I pulled the chair out from underneath the prospect as they were trying to sit in it. They're gonna think, this guy's not gonna try to pitch me. The brain is turned on again. You've lowered the pressure of the sale. And now what you're gonna do is you're gonna get them to pile on even more. You gotta get them talking. It's shown in the Gong data that the longer the call goes, the more likely they are to book a meeting with you, and that means you have to have enough back and forth to demonstrate that you're not a complete rando and you can actually hold a conversation. I'm gonna incentivize them to stay on the line and have a little bit more conversation. That sounds like this. From there, I'm gonna say, Nick, just so no one calls you again, is it that there's no budget for this cycle, or is it that literally any spend whatsoever requires you to do, like, a triple backflip? Notice there are two things at play in this talk track. Number one, the incentive to stay on the phone. Could you really pile on to this objection? The other thing is I'm splitting the objection. So I'm saying, is it no budget this cycle, or is it any spend whatsoever is pretty much impossible? And the reason that this is important is this not only demonstrates my industry expertise, it also demonstrates that I'm listening, and I actually heard their objection out. And it makes it easy for them to reply and just pick an option and share more about the objection, which will help me handle it more effectively. But, honestly, even if they don't give me the fact that I got asked a question and I got them talking a little bit more, that alone is enough to lower their guard just a little bit. And this is the last place where most sellers will screw it up is the prospect will give them an answer. Look. It's it's a bit of both. To be frank, like, we're we're really just tight on cash, and then they'll go right back to pitching. Your goal is not to sell the car right now. It's to sell the test drive. You need to answer the question. Why should they meet with you even if they don't end up buying your product? So it sounds like this. I'm gonna say, honestly, Nick, I get it. You're probably not gonna buy this thing right now. But I I know this might sound like a crazy idea. If budget does free up down the road, usually, the the people who get it at least have a directional sense of what they'd want. So would you be open to taking a look at this thing later on in the week? Not for now, but just so you know what's out there for down the road. The reason that Nick is gonna take the meeting is not because he wants to buy the Tesla right now. The reason he's taking the meeting is because I'm giving him a way to secure budget in the future. He's gonna look like a total goon if budget frees up, and he's, I don't know what I want, but can I go find some something to buy? He at least wants to know what's on the punch list when he's in the meeting. That's when I can sell him on how we're gonna get rid of his current car, how we're gonna finance it, or how we're gonna do a rip and replace. But you can't do that on a cold call. You just met him. So those were the three steps. Agree, get them talking, incentivize conversation, and then you're gonna sell a test drive. Alright? Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Amazing. So, Arman, let's actually make this a little more real for people. Now that folks have the Miyagi framework, let us know in the chat what objections you are running into the most, and we'll show you some examples of how you can Miyagi them. While folks are typing that, one thing to know about objections is there's a couple different types, dismissive objections, situational objections, and existing solution objections. And while you're gonna Miyagi all of them, the approach, depending upon the type, varies slightly. You all saw we don't have any budget. Let's let's see. Arman, I don't know if you've been watching the chat. Let's hit the competitor one. There are a lot of competitors. And then let's do that one first. And then gatekeepers is coming up. Not interested is coming up a lot. Let's do that. Folks, in the book, we literally pulled data with Gong on the 18 most common objections, and we gave scripts on how to handle every single one of them. We won't be able to get into all 18, but let's do the competitor one here, Armand. Alright. So we do this in house. It's a long standing policy. That's a it's a brutal one. With competitors, the key with any competitor or in house solution is for each of your major competitors or competitor buckets, you need to memorize one trap question. K? One trap question. And a trap question is a question that pokes a hole in something their current solution can't do that your solution can do. When I was selling compensation software at Pave, there were other providers really good at salary plannings. But if you ever wanted to give stock option bonuses, it was a complete mess, and you had to do that separately on spreadsheets. Watch how I'm gonna turn that into a trap question and pry that open into a bigger problem. So three, two, one. Sorry, ma'am. We're using CompX. Oh, CompX. Honestly, Nick, they're great, and it it rarely makes sense to switch off of them if you actually like them. Just so no one else from my team reaches out. You're not doing stock option bonuses or anything like that. Right? Well, we are, but why? Other HR teams usually find that when managers can't see the cash and equity in the same place, they'll request a bigger cash bonus to make up for the fact that they can't see that the person's total cash plus equity is actually quite large. And so that's actually something that we support is we do all the cash equity planning and everything in one place. My guess is you're still not gonna switch. But if nothing else, would you be open to taking a look at this thing just so you know it's out there? So notice the trap question I asked was, oh, like, you're not doing stock option bonuses. Right? I'm assuming that they're gonna they're not gonna fall in the trap. Right? But I know because I'm calling tech companies. I know Nick is doing stock option bonuses. If he's on CompX, I know the trap question that's gonna poke a hole, and then I'm going to poke the or I'm gonna pry open the impact of that hole and say, oh, that actually turns into a bigger problem from you. Again, I'm never pooh pooh ing on Nick's solution. I'm always saying, it's probably not gonna make sense for you to switch. Like, you're probably not gonna make the move right now, but why don't you take a look? And that's when I can actually get them to do the rip and replace later on. Awesome. So I think, a couple of other people are saying not interested, Armand. That's definitely a dismissive objection almost always when you get not interested. It's not that they're not interested in what you sell. It's that they're not interested in the cold call, and they're just trying to get you off the phone. This one can often be very abrasive where people will be like, I'm not interested. You've gotta respond in equally ridiculous fashion. Make them realize how ridiculous this is also to equal things out. You wanna role play this one? Let's do it. And just to give you guys a sense, like, 50% of objections are dismissive objections. So, like, these ones, literally, half of them are dismissive objections. They're just swats. And you'll notice that the the framework to handle I'm not interested is very emblematic of other objections. We're gonna agree with the objection, be really disarmingly blunt, and then we're gonna get to the real objection because dismissive objections are not real objections. Alright. Three, two, one. Right. I'm not interested. My bad, Nick. Look. Either my pitch was really crummy or you you would've reached out to us if you were. Just so no one calls you again, could you be brutally honest with me? Is it that you've got a solution, you you're not thinking about this problem at all, or is it that you just hate getting hold calls and it's okay if it's number three? We're already using SalesGoons Compaq solution. Alright? There you go. SalesGoons' Compaq solution. Fantastic. Alright. So what I did there is notice I agreed with the objection, disarmingly blunt in Nick's rather bizarre role play voice there. And then number two, you gotta quickly get him to stay on the line. Otherwise, like, not interested. From there, you gotta split the objection here. My split is in house solution, competitor, or, like, my pitch sucked. Mhmm. By doing that, I'm probably going to get the competitor or the in house solution, or Nick might just be like, wait. What do you do? Because he wasn't listening the first time. Mhmm. Now I have the real objection. I see some people in the chat saying next call, next lead. Exactly. Like, you've gotta keep them on the phone for it's like a game of inches. You get the next objection, but realistically with not interested, like, you've got a second to keep them on the line. Yeah. Alright. Let's keep moving forward. We've got a million other objections in the book. Again, we'll send out links to get all this stuff live, but, hopefully, that gives you a sense of the high level methodology for handling any objection. Gatekeepers, voice mails, they prevent you from even getting to the conversation in the first place. How do you think about them? How do you handle gatekeepers with the triple bypass, which is not a surgery? And then how do you leave double tap voice mails? Gatekeepers. Awesome. So let's talk about getting past gatekeepers. Think about the gatekeepers job. Gatekeepers have two responsibilities. Job number one is to shut the door on people who don't belong. People like us, salespeople. This is the job that most of us see with gatekeepers getting the door shut on us. But they also have another job, which is to open the door for people who do belong. If they sense that this might be a salesperson calling to be connected, they're gonna shut the door on you, which is why trying to befriend the gatekeeper or share a little bit about your pitch doesn't work. Your gatekeeper is not going to put their job at risk connecting some random salesperson to their boss. Instead, we're gonna get past the gatekeeper is ethically, we're never gonna lie, We're going to make it seem like we're someone who should have the door open for us. And we're gonna do that both in the tone of what we say as well as this information we choose to share and not share. We use what's called the gatekeeper triple bypass approach. With the triple bypass, you have three tries to get past the gatekeeper, and they build on each other. So if your first try doesn't work, you still have a shot at the second and a shot at the third. The first step in the triple bypass method is called the slide by, where you are simply going to be asked to be connected to your prospect, nothing else. And so it might sound something like this. Gatekeeper answers the phone and they go, hello. Aubrey Graham's office. I'm gonna say, hey. Could you get me over to Aubrey? It's Nick. No company name. No small talk here. Nothing about my product. I'm also using first names. I'm making it seem like I'm walking straight to the elevator, and they shouldn't get in my way. This will get us past some percentage of gatekeepers. But the savvier ones are gonna push us for a little bit more. They're gonna ask us something like, well, what's this regarding? And right here is where most gatekeeper passes fail because this is where most salespeople bluntly share their company name or they talk about their product or they try to make friends with the gatekeeper. Instead, what I'm gonna do is give them context for why I'm calling and keep the focus on getting me to my destination. If I use your Northwestern example, Arman, I'll say something like, yeah. I actually work with a couple other SCAN partners in the LA office. Would would you give him a heads up? It's Nick Sigalski. I'm sharing, hey. I work with their peers, and I'm asking a question to keep the focus on getting me to my destination. The person asking the questions is the one who controls the conversation, and we want that to be us. And that will get us past another series of gatekeepers, but the toughest ones will push us for even more. And And they might say something like, I need to see if he's in. What company are you with, sir? At this point, I don't wanna get into the pitch. I don't want them to feel like there's a pitch behind the salesperson coming, and I wanna share some social proof. So in this case, I might say something like, yeah. We actually help a couple other partners in the office with their tax planning. It's Northwestern Mutual. I actually sent him a note the other day. Would would you mind letting him know it's Nick? This assumes I've emailed them in the past. But what I'm doing is I'm never leaning on company or product. I'm using context and social proof as a way to get past. Now the Gong data unfortunately showed that when you encounter a gatekeeper, it reduces your success rate on a cold call by almost 40%. And so if you still get shut down here, you might throw in the towel and ask to leave a voice mail, and that's perfectly fine. But this will get you past a significant number of gatekeepers. Alrighty. And that brings us to the last thing that can prevent you from getting to the call at all, which are voice mails. Should you leave voice mails at all? There are a few questions that will trigger as many sales floor debates as this one. The common arguments against voice mails are number one, people never call back. Number two, they take a lot of time. Number three, they drop your connect rate by 28. And that's probably the most dangerous one right there. He was already gonna block me because he saw my phone number, but he's far less likely to pick up a call from me again if he knows that I already called him before. That said, voice mail is literally double your email reply. So it's huge. In every other email in your sequence or your flow The key is these concerns have some merit to them. This is actually going to alter our strategy. Because people never call back, when we leave voice mails, we are not gonna ask for a callback. We're gonna direct them to reply over email. That's number one. Number two, because they take a lot of time, we're only gonna lead to two voice mails. That's why they're called double tap voice mails. That actually shows that reply rates will spike between one and two voice mails. Anything after that is overkill, and you're just wasting your time. As you leave voice mails, you should be rotating your phone numbers. Most sales engagement platforms allow you to do this because you wanna keep that connect rate high on your future dials. Let's walk through the two different voice mail talk tracks. Again, great screenshot moment. Time to scan the QR codes. First voice mail. Nick, we work with a few other Skadden partners in the LA office. No need to call me back. I'm about to hit send on an email. Would you mind replying and letting me know if it's even moderately interesting? Most people pitch in the voice mail or lead with their name and company. The moment you do those things, instantly deleted. Voice mail is instantly deleted. So what we're doing is we're actually stacking the voice mail. We're front loading the voice mail with the stuff that is most likely to actually get them to reply, which is the fact that we work with other folks in their office or the fact that one of our customers shares a similar investor or that we work with other compensation partners in the Chicago area. The second voice mail, similar to the gatekeeper approach. If the context only approach didn't get us a reply, we give them a little bit more. We're still not gonna pitch, but we're gonna hide the social proof in the email. It sounds like this. Hey, Nick. We work with a few other Scadden partners in the LA office on their tax planning, investments, amongst other things. I'm sure you've got most of that stuff taken care of. I'm about to press send on an email to give you a sense of what we're doing with those other folks. Just so we don't play phone tag, would you mind replying and letting me know if it's even moderately interesting over there? It'll come from Arman at Northwestern. Cheers. So all I'm doing is doing is I'm really emphasizing the fact that I work with these other folks and give you a sense over email, like, how I work with them. You can totally tell me to kick rocks if you don't like it. Move on. Keep calling them, but don't keep leaving voice mails. Congratulations. This has covered everything that you're going to say on the phones, but like we said earlier, it's all about what you're doing off the phones to make sure that you're even getting to these conversations. So let's start with dial conversion. This is probably the most underrated chapter in the book. I have hired over a 100 SDRs in my career, and I have never found that the number one performer has the highest activity on the board. It takes time to prune your bad numbers to make sure you have a high connect rate. It takes time to prioritize your prospects and take the bad ones out of your pipeline so that you have a high set rate. It takes time to convert your meetings. And if you use all of that time towards making more cold calls, your conversion would be horrendous. The best sellers dial smart and break the sales math equation. The single most commonly screwed up places with connect rates, that's what we're gonna cover. You might remember from the data in the beginning that the seventy fifth percentile rep had more than double the connect rate of the average rep. And in the book, we've got it's something like twenty, twenty five different tips and best practices to increase your connect rates. I don't have time to go through all of those in the twelve minutes left, so let's go deep on one of them. Let's talk about marking your tracks. Marking your tracks is as follows. The first time you call through a new list of numbers should be your lowest connect rate and your least efficient calls through those numbers. And the reason for it is you're gonna call numbers that end up being fax lines and you hear that screeching noise or you'll call somebody and somebody answers, but it's not your prospect. It's the wrong number. And what you wanna do is leave yourself notes. You wanna mark your tracks about the numbers at your disposal. As you call through numbers, you should mark them based upon their quality. Red numbers are bad numbers. These are the repeated busy lines, fax lines, wrong numbers. Once you've marked a number as red, you should never waste another dial on it again. Your yellow numbers are the ones where something smells fishy. It rings once and then goes right to voice mail, or it's a busy signal. If this happens once, mark it as yellow. If it happens again, move it to red and don't waste your time on it. Your green numbers are the ones where you are a 100% sure that it's the right person. This rings multiple times and their voice mail greeting confirms it's them. Over time, you start to build up a dial inventory or a dial base with all of your historical knowledge about the right numbers to call for your prospects. Additionally, you'll mark your tracks for other things. If you encounter phone trees, you'll mark the dial path that you need to hit to get to your prospect. So the first time you listen to a phone tree, you should be jotting out, okay, I need to hit +1 3476 to get right to Arman. So the next time I call, I can punch that in right away and not have to listen to that. Another example, there's a gatekeeper. I'll mark that they're on the other end of the line, so I'm prepared to run the triple bypass. So there's way more, but that is one way that you can boost connect rates. Folks, there are a million ways to break the sales math equation, but you can see the differences between the average rep and the top quartile rep are massive. Those tactics will get you from a five to a 13% connect rate. It's huge. Boost your set rate, build a list, and prioritize people likely to buy right now. And then for your show rates, you can get those from 56% to 72% just by sending two really solid confirmation emails, one a week prior and one the day prior. And if you booked it inside of the week, send the confirmation email the day before, and we include some research or some context in it to show that you prepared for the call. Alright? We'll send more on that afterwards. You'll find more on that in the book. But, folks, the beauty of this is now that you have efficient and smart dials, it's time to dial as much as possible because you have all the talk tracks you need, and you're not dialing like a buffoon and just calling all these bad numbers. We're gonna talk about the perfect time to cold call, how to make sure this stuff gets in your calendar, and how to double your dials. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. The best time of day to make your cold calls is first thing in the morning. We looked at the data with Gong, and you can see the morning has the highest connect rate. The real reason you should dial in the morning is when you prioritize making your cold calls before you're allowed to do anything else, it guarantees that you get them done that day. Slight variances in pickup rate, which you can see across the day, the number one thing is consistency. And so you make sure you get it done every day by doing it first thing before everything else. That will make up for any variances in connect rate in your specific industry. Do it first thing, get it off your plate, and then move on to other more enjoyable pieces of selling. That said, this is much easier said than done because there are other jobs you have to do in sales. So you're gonna divide your day into thirds, your green hours where you're gonna try to hit your prospecting goal, your yellow hours when you're gonna take most of your customer calls from twelve to three, and your red hours from three to six when you're gonna be doing most of your admin work. So the way that you actually do this in practice is step one, you gotta tame your inbox. If you are replying to your prospects three times per day at 08:30, twelve, and three, It is okay. They can wait a second. If you just constantly get dragged around by your inbox all the time, you will find that your pipeline is going down and down and down because you're chasing your deals. Once you control the inbox, then you start to plot your prospecting blocks. I like to have three of them. Two in the morning, one in the afternoon, especially great for East Coast folks who wanna hit Pacific in the morning. First, cold calls at 9AM, then a cold email block at eleven, then flex prospecting from one to two. Hit your prospecting daily goal in these first two ones. This third block is the block that gets you to president's club. This is when you get ahead. From there, take customer calls in the blocks in between. Try to prioritize those ones in the afternoons, but the reality is every once in a while, someone's only gonna be able to meet at nine, and that's okay. The rule is if you have to book a meeting at nine over your cold call block, you cannot move the cold call block out of nine to twelve, and so make sure that stays in those green hours. The final piece is a lot of people think that cold calling or sending emails are the same thing as building a list of prospects. That is not true. That is admin or prospecting preparation. So at the end of the day, find the accounts, find the contacts, sequence the contacts, and make sure that you step into the next day with 60 dials locked and loaded. Congratulations. You know what that means? You have the opener, the problem prop, the objections, the voicemails, the gatekeepers. You know how to maximize your dial conversion. You know how to plan your day. The only thing that will stop you is if you don't make the calls. The final conclusion covers how to kill call reluctance forever, which I believe call reluctance is fundamentally a confidence issue. And I define confidence as the extent to which you believe your inputs will lead to the outputs. Do you actually believe that you will book a meeting if you make enough cold calls? Mhmm. But you can try to manufacture this confidence by reading more books, writing out your scripts, researching the prospects, or you could even try to do that by reading our book 17 times. Or you could realize that the only way to really prove this to yourself is to make it a reality. You have to make so many cold calls that you become numb to the rejection, and your mind makes the connection that 50 dials equals one meeting over time. And the hundredth time you hear prospect implode, you will laugh despite the fact that the first time that you heard the prospect implode, you will freak out. And so the reason that you're okay with this is because you know the meeting is coming because you've proved it to yourself in the past. So am I suggesting you go into the game underprepared? No. You only need two things to get started. Your minimum viable talk tracks, and we gave you those today, and then go practice them around the block 50 times. And you don't even have to read this book. And so on that note, I was gonna tell Nick we should just tell people not to read the book. But, apparently, there are still some reasons to read this thing. There are plenty of reasons to still get the book. Arman, you and I have always given away the sales tactics for free. But the reason that you should still buy it is there are so many more frameworks in the book and talk tracks that we didn't cover with tone voice overs that you can scan and stories in there. This session just skimmed the very top of what's in the book. There is so much more value in the structure and format of what we wrote. And so, folks, if you don't believe us, you might believe these people no one's ever heard of. Jeb Blunt, the author of Fanatical Prospecting, Matt Dixon, the author of Challenger Sale. Keenan, Gap Selling. John Barros. Jason Bey. Mark Casiglio started the Outreach sales team. Ian Konjac, number one all time rep at Salesforce. Amit Bendoff, CEO of Gong. KD, the legendary four time CRO VP of sales. And Ken Amar, who's Outreach's number one all time SDR, plus everyone who has already written down that this is the best cold calling book that they have ever read in their lives, we'll give you the cold call script in the first pages so you can start cold calling. If you like what you see, you'll have success on the phones, and people will ask how you did it, and we hope that you share this book with other people around you. So on that note, we're out of time. Go get your book. Folks, if you have an iPhone or an iPad, you can get to the Kindle app and read it on that also. Apple Books, Nook. If anyone's a Nook reader or whatever it is. If you love it, pick up a paperback. Thank you, everybody, for joining us. We worked really hard on this. Arman and I spent almost a year. Every single day, we spent three or four hours a day writing, and we beat the heck out of each other writing this thing. We really pushed each other to make this the most actionable, practical, usable book so that you don't have to spend countless hours reading 12 other books on cold calling. We wrote this because selling is really tough right now. Building pipeline's really tough right now, and we wanna make it easy on all of you. Please pick it up. Thank you, folks. It is unbelievable that this is a job for Nick and I, and we are both extremely grateful to have y'all as supporters. Peace.
