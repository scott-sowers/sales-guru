## Transcript

The biggest mistake I've seen with sales leaders is is that they stay so convicted on their stages. This is my sales process. You must follow this. The frame that I usually use, it's irregardless of stages. AES. Right? Where are our prospects at on their journey as a buyer? Are they in the awareness? They don't even know they have a problem. They think they might, but they're just meeting with us to try to maybe learn more about the problem that they may or may not have. They're not sure. Are they at the e or the education? Hey. They know they have a problem. Now they're trying to figure out how to solve it. It. Right? Do I buy a technology? Do I hire somebody? Do I build a process manually internally? And then the last piece of that is the selection or the s. Okay. I have now understood I have a problem. I've now made a determination that I wanna solve it. So now it's about choosing the right vendor. And I think that frame for for sellers can help them operate within stages that built correctly of, like, where is my buyer at in this journey? Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my co host, Mark Cosiglow. And today, I don't think we've ever had anyone on the show who's worked for Mark Cosiglow before. But as of today, I'm amazed, and I understand that there is a magic to the madness of working with Mark. And today, we have the one and only SVP of sales, Nate Broom. In all seriousness, Mark has brought some of the best leadership guests we've had of all time on this show, and Nate is no exception to that rule. If you want a master class in how to build your sales process, this is the one for you. Mark, why should people listen? This was our master of process at Outreach. If there was a process that needed to be built, I gave it to Nate and his team, and they would built it, and then we would then edit it and and revise it for other segments. He is a process driven thinker, and I think he has the resume that shows that he can drive process to actual results. Alright, Nate. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get you three. Alright. Right off the bat, prep for your week. Right? So what I tactically do every week is Sunday night, I look at my calendar, specifically honing in on Monday as to how am I gonna get my team, set up for success, right out the gate. Right? So so tactically, how that might look is if we have a big pipeline generation goal for our AEs that week, say, 1,000,000, what's our plan? So does every AE have a plan to get out the gate, right away? What accounts are they gonna go after? Do we know what personas? Do we have the persona messaging? All that type of stuff. And have we clearly communicated it to everybody. Right? And so I'm looking for that from my leaders. Right? And if I see it, then it's great. We're gonna have a great week. If I don't see it, then we're gonna probably have an early morning Monday meeting, to make sure that we have that to to get rolling for the week. You know, the other piece that I look at when I'm doing my prep on on Sunday nights is, you know, urgent items like a a board meeting or a big forecast call or a big deal prep. Right? They have a way of having this gravitational pull, on your calendar, your time, your focus. And so if you can create space to, either prep on Sunday night for it or create space in your calendar through the week to, actually give it the space that it deserves to make sure that you show up confident and, show up to hit the objective, you're just gonna feel a whole lot better about how you're executing your week. Awesome. What's number two? Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. So one of the favorite things that I do, whether I've been enrolled, it's a new role, I just did this with my, new leaders, at Common Room, last week on an off-site, is map out your sales process. Right? And a lot of people do this. Right? So our sales process typically is a discovery, a demo, a technical validation. You get into some scoping change management element of the process and then a a proposal and and contracting. And everyone does the high level thing. That's usually what's written on paper. But what I mean specifically is map out exactly what you expect to happen pre the call, during the call, post the call at every single stage. And, you know, do you have your reps set up? And so a great example of that would be post call, recap. Right? We encourage our reps to send recaps. Do they have a template in outreach or sales law for the the a recap template so they know how to actually hit that expectation. So that's what I mean by mapping it out. Right? And what you'll usually find is that you have process gaps or enablement gaps somewhere throughout your process that you need to to coach, coach to or develop a process for. Could you give us the third takeaway? Be a personal trainer. Right? You know, so when I think about personal trainer, you know, you show up to the gym at 05:30 in the morning. You don't wanna be there, but that personal trainer is there to to high five, high five you, encourage you, have a plan for the day, make sure that you're hitting your sets, your KPIs, all that stuff. And so when I think of being a personal trainer for a sales manager, right, it's ensuring that you have a plan for how you're to get your rep into a healthy spot, whether those are deals or pipeline or whatever. Right? And once you have that plan in place, you've aligned on that plan, and it could be, hey. We're gonna move this many deals from stage three to stage four. We're gonna generate this much pipeline. Whatever the the meat of what you're trying to accomplish is, then you can bolt on, hey. How are you going to encourage them? How are you gonna meet them where they're at? How are you gonna keep your energy high? And then when you have the activity, you have something to coach. So you can coach their form if they're actually doing the thing that you need them to do so they could even excel even at greater levels. Right? So so be a personal trainer. This is what I always tell our frontline sales leaders. I think that there's a theme in our three tips. I spend Sunday night planning for my week. I, plan out my sales process, and I expect my managers to have a plan for each of their reps. You obviously don't like impromptu action. You want let me put a little thought into it before I hit it. Right? So what I'd love to do is let's go back to common room. Like, make me and Armand your sales managers at common room, and let's go through this. How do how do you figure out what your sales process is? How do you map that out? Like, take us through some of the exercise, like, we're we're working for you right now. Yeah. So we literally did did this last week. So this is a very real time exercise. We opened up Lucidchart, a workflow document, quite literally asked the question, tell me about the first call. And so our sales managers, were talking about what they expect to have happen. We didn't have the opportunity to do this because we're we're so new to the scene, but you would typically wanna have some reps in this conversation as well, right, to help influence. But what happens on the first call? And then through that, you start understanding what we've established as expectations or best practices, and you write it all down. Usually, everybody in the first call, there's alignment. Then you get to the next call, where it's like, hey. We're gonna do a demo. That's the goal of this call is to demo our product and show the show the technology. And then you start diverging sometimes in terms of, well, this is how I demo this. This is why I focus on a demo here, and you start hearing from the managers some divergence of thought, right, or divergence of practice that they're coaching, almost always by the time you get to the third call, right, or the third step of the process, now you have some major divergences of this is how I've been coaching this. This is how, the tactics that we've been taking. Right? And it's a really great moment because the reality is is that we have our expectation as leaders. We have what's documented. But the most important thing is what is actually occurring for the reps. Right? What are what is the systems and the tooling the reps are operating in? And is the system designed to support them, or is the system designed for them to have to overcome it? Yeah. I remember when we were at Carta, a lot of times I would see managers be really upset because after a demo call, a rep would send, like, a ridiculous recap. And after a discovery call, it would be a super long recap versus another rep would send a super short recap and all that stuff. And so what we ended up doing is we ran this training called sales transitions, and it was literally like, what's the prep doc before every single meeting? Yep. And then what's the recap email that you send after every single meeting? And a discovery call recap email is really simple. It's like, here are the four problems that we had. Here's the next step we agreed upon. But a demo recap might be much more complex where maybe you're introducing, here are the four solutions we discussed to those problems. Here's a mini joint execution plan of the three next steps that we planned, and now we need to kick off whatever it is, something that involves maybe a business case or pulling in power or something like that. Yep. Every single recap is completely different, and reps will revert back to their bad habits if you don't initially give them a frame of how to approach each meeting. A a thousand percent. And and I will kinda reframe this conversation, right, in a set like, in a way that we are trying to put rails on a on a process, right, for people to operate. I I much equate it to, like, a basketball team. When you watch the the NBA finals are going on right now as of this recording, right, and they're running sets, you know, every single time down the floor. But the whole point is within the framework of the offense is to put an athlete on the spot on the floor where they can take the highest percentage shot to make the basket. Right? And so I think, you know, Mark, we talk about, like, these creative moments or these, you know you know, letting athletes be athletes. The whole point is to put an athlete on a spot on the floor where they can unleash their genius, their authentic self, what makes them, you know, awesome as a as a seller. Right? That something that can't be defined by process or it pushes the envelope on us as a sales organization of, like, here's the new level of greatness. Right? And so when I think about process and then the importance of mapping all this stuff out, it's really to create those magic moments of where our sellers can go be great. Right? And then show us what's what's possible. What are the key calls in your process that you had to see included by your team in order to feel like, alright. We actually have a fully baked process here. What were those steps? It depends on the segment and what you're doing. Right? So I would say that, like, you know, look, I I think the audience knows or doesn't know, but, you know, Mark, I worked for you for years, and my first assignment under you was leading our SMB, teams. Right? That was super transactional. You could build your process around calls. Right? So you, like it was like this call is this call, and this call is you know, we're doing a demo. In this call, we are scoping the thing out. In this call, we're doing proposal. And you could quite literally build out your sales process around calls. Now as you move up market, you know, into the enterprise or upper mid market, there's more complexity. I think that's where stages and exit criteria start, like, playing a way bigger part. Right? Because, you know, even though we would like enterprises to do what we want them to do from a sales process, that's not how it works. Right? And so, you know, when so I think about exit criteria at the simplistic form, yes, you start with discovery in the first call. Right? First and foremost, is there even a problem that we can solve? Just straight up. Right? Is there if if we're going to go down this pathway, as a dance partner with with an enterprise or an upper mid market company, is there anything we can solve? Right? Is there a project to attach to? So that's why I try for in the discovery. Right? In maybe the next phase, which you would maybe equate in a transactional model to a demo, right, is, like, us showing the technology is, you know, can we demonstrate, that we can solve the problem? And so can we at least, spark enough interest to say, we think you've told us this is your problem. Here's how, you know, our technology would solve it. Is there alignment that, you know, we're talking the same language, that we're moving towards the same objective and same goal? If there is, we kinda get into stage three, which is, can the technology actually solve the problem, right, where you start scoping and doing more technical validation and and more deeper dive stuff. So that's kinda how I think about it based off of the segments. Right? As you as you move up market, it's more about exit criteria, down market. It's it's more about getting from call to call to call. And can we keep going through that? So I just now agree. Is there a problem to solve? Demo. Can you demo that you solve the problem? Third, technical validation. Does the tech actually solve the problem? What are the final stages and exit criteria? Yeah. Then I would get into, like, scoping change management. Right? Of, like, can we actually get into can our technology work? Can we understand how we would stand it up? Can we understand the dependencies that, exist there? Right? That's where I think the rubber meets the road. Right? As we we've proven out these things. Now we're actually in your environment. Can we make it true? Can we turn this thing on, if we we intend to? And then finally, then you get into contracting, which is, you know, your proposal negotiation, bigger orgs gets into enterprise. Procurement. Right. So then you go into proposal negotiation. Your exit criteria is, can you agree on a price? And then vendor review, does someone actually sign a contract? Right? Yeah. Yep. So I'm curious when you're building this out. Alright? You've got your one, two, three, four, five, in this case, six stages. Disco, demo, tech validation, scoping and change management, proposal and negotiation, and then vendor review. When you actually aligned on, like, these six as your process, what did you do with it? Did you, like, roll it out to the team in a big sales process training where it was, like, this is what you do before, middle, and after? Like, how do I actually, like, put this in the practice? At Outreach, by the the the last time we did this, as we were kind of evolving into a multiproduct company, we had a ton of data. And so we did a rollout, like, at a QBR type situation where the data kind of informed, hey. We're graduating into these actual criterias. We're graduating into these stages. It made a lot of sense because it was already kinda happening for the team when they all had twenty, thirty opportunities in their name. They They were experiencing this in LiveFire. At Captivate, that was a younger organization, right, in terms of the the maturity curve. That was when we put stages in place. We had to do a way more thoughtful rollout. Right? Because they they hadn't actually previously had stages. We were working through the stages with the top reps, then we did a rollout, to the organization at, a kickoff, and, we walked them through step by step by step. We gave them, you know, here are the questions that you would wanna ask to achieve, the desired outcome and exit criteria. And we basically dedicated probably about an hour to each stage of tactically how do you actually get a deal from here to here to here. So the intent right now is I'm on day 10. We've mapped this whole thing out last week on day five or six. My next move, now that we've got a perspective from the sales perspective, is I need to align cross functionally with my post sale partners, and where and my, marketing partners, who have SDRs, make sure that we're all talking the same language. We're focused on closing q two. We'll do a, a launch at a all hands kickoff, here in August where we'll take the team through step by step by step. When you're thinking through, like, alright. Does my team actually know how to go from stage one to stage two? What are the biggest things that you can do to help them understand that process? Like because, again, nobody's come on through and be like, after you do a discovery call, this is how you get somebody to agree to move into the next stage of their buying their buying journey. Right? The biggest mistake I've seen with with sales leaders is is that they stay so convicted on their stages. Right? They see so convicted on this is my sales process. You must follow this. Right? And what ends up happening is you get a bunch of people trying to operate within a machine, and no one's thinking for themselves. Right? And I find market the pipeline reviews is that, you know, the conceptual stuff is what ends up being missed. Right? Is the simple question is, what problem are you solving? Mhmm. How do they make money? Who cares about this problem? Right? These are obviously very intrinsic to the deal type of questions. But because we're so focused on maybe the exit criterias or moving stages or, you know, whatever, we sometimes miss the basics. And so the the frame that I usually use, actually, it's irregardless of stages, is I think we learned this from Jocko and winning by design, is, AES. Right? So where are our, prospects at on their journey as a buyer? Are they in the awareness, part of their journey where they don't even know they have a problem? They think they might, but they're just meeting with us to try to maybe learn more about the problem that they may or may not have. They're not sure. Right? Are they the e or the education part of, their journey where it's, hey. They know they have a problem. Now they're trying to figure out how to solve it. Right? Do I buy a technology? Do I hire somebody? Do I build a process manually internally? What do I do? Right? And then the last piece of that is the selection or the s of that. Right? So a e s, selection, is okay. I have now understood that I have a problem. I've now made a determination that I wanna solve it. Right? Use buying software in our in our, case. Right? And so now it's about choosing the right vendor. And so you're in a selection phase. Right? And I think that frame for for sellers can help them operate within stages if built correctly of, like, where is my buyer at in this journey? Right? Because our stages don't matter to our buyer. Right? Just what matters about where they're at in the journey. So that's, like, that's one. Right? And then I think the second piece would just be simplification wherever possible, like, going back to discovery and stay stage one. Is there a problem we can solve? That might just be it. It might be your only criteria. Right? Obviously, there's gonna be other things, but, anywhere you can simplify it, will help reps navigate. Neda, if we double back on on this question, I think an answer that might be helpful for the audience. How do you clearly define what a rep needs to get in stage one? And that's what you said. It's like, is there clearly a problem? And then two, what do you teach a rep to get it? Like, is that where you're literally teaching discovery step by step? I think giving giving a sense of, like, how do I teach my reps to get that thing Yeah. Now down we have the exit criteria established. That's that's what would be really helpful. You know? How are you how are you spending that one hour teaching the stage one to stage two? I am not one of these sales leaders that lives in guys on you gotta ask the best questions in the world. I'm a simple sales guy. Right? And so when I think about, Mark, actually, you got this from you back in the day. Right? Was what's the win coming off the call? What's a w? Right? What do what do we get a high five about if this goes well on the call? Right? And I I I love that frame because we establish our exit criteria. And let's just say for this argument that, like, our exit criteria is only just do you find a problem that we can solve? Like, that's it. That's the only thing we're going for. We're gonna give tactics. Here's the types of questions. Hey. What's the o in your OKRs? Right? What's keeping you up at night? What's on your whiteboard, right now? What are you and your boss talk about often? What have you identified in your process? You know, what is the you know, what's red on your, on your dashboard right now? There's a bunch of different ways to ask the problem question to sort of get to the meat of it. Right? But what I always tell the reps is I don't care how you get there, just that you get there. Right? And the example I use is, like, look. You know, baseball. Right? Does it matter if you win the game nine to one or two to one? Yeah. It it doesn't matter. Right? So if you ask the the world's best discovery questions, if you have the best discovery call, it's a 10 out of 10. We all agree that this is the best discovery call we've ever heard. You just did an awesome job getting to what's the problem we're solving. Now you can have the worst discovery call. It can be clunky. You could trip over your words. You're umming and ahhing all over the place. It's not even coherent. But if after the end of that forty five minute or sixty minute discovery call, if you got that one problem that we can solve and they agreed to continue to explore that problem, that's a win. And that's how we gotta teach our reps. Right? Is, it's more about the meet and the outcome than it is always about, like, the finesse of how you get there. I think that Nate ran maybe one of the the most efficient SMB orgs on the planet. We're talking like I think we were in the mid teens on deal cycles, under thirty day sales, or average contract value, under thirty day sales cycles, over a 130% NRR, 30 30 to 35% win rates. I mean, 80% participation across the I mean, just insane numbers that don't even make sense, to be honest with you. And that was a very transactional sale, and what Nate and his team did is they were very prescriptive. We had a deck. We called them the five decks. You master the five decks, you will get to a 35% win rate, and you will go to The Bahamas twice a year if you want to. Right? And that's that's what we train. But then as he he's doing so good, we kept giving him bigger and bigger and bigger accounts. Well, by the end, he was doing 6 figure deals regularly every quarter, dozen of them or more. Those required a different type of thing. That's when he started to say, listen. It's not so much about how you do it. It's about what you end up with. And so as you're if you're a sales leader and you're thinking about process and how much how prescriptive am I in telling people how to do something, You need to look at where you're at on that transactional to enterprise and sale. The more transactional, the more micromanaged you can make your sales process. The more enterprise, the more big picture, and, like, this is what we're trying to accomplish in the buyer's mind before we move on. How you do that is kind of up to you. What is the big w? Pick another stage, whether it's demo, technical validation, scoping, proposal. What is the big w that you give your reps guidance on getting? And then what are, like, two or three tools that you give them to get the big w? My mind goes right to the next call, which is, you know or the next stage, which is gonna be demoing the the technology. In this stage, you have a suspicion that you can help. Right? We we've been able to narrow our, our conversation to a problem or set of problems that we've, we've uncovered in that first stage, and now we have a suspicion that we could potentially solve that through our technology. Right? And I think that the mistake that a lot of sellers make is they try to show everything. Right? All the capabilities, all the features, all the bells and whistles, like, the whole deal. And then everyone's confused after. Right? So a tactic that that I like to see is and let's just say we're solving three problems. That's the we've agreed on. Like, these are the three things we can solve. Right? And so for Conner Room, you know, we're we're effectively solving, you know, pipeline and, like, deal acceleration. This is the is the space that we play in. Right? And I was on discovery call on Friday. His big issue with this, eggnog virus big issue was that, hey. I'm doing great in two of my three segments, but my commercial segment is a thousand to 2,000. We're really struggling generating pipeline. So first, that's the topic of the demo. This demo is about how we're gonna help you solve, you know, the generating pipeline within this a thousand to 2,000 employee band. Full stop. Headline. Right? Here are the three things we're gonna show you. So then we set the frame for them. Like, hey. There's three things we're gonna show you that lead to this. And then when we go to show those three things, so it's headline. It's, you know, what we're gonna go show you. And then we actually go to show you it's we're gonna show you one thing, and then it's gonna be, Mark, I just showed you this thing. Do you agree that it solved your problem? Yes or no? And if it's a yes, awesome. We're gonna move on to the next thing. If it's a no or if it's a maybe, well, maybe we didn't articulate it well enough. Maybe we moved too fast. Maybe we didn't ask the right questions. Something. Right? So those are the tactics that I would take, the reps through, in the demo phase. And then, again, the the end goal or the w coming out of that that phase is, did we show you that we can solve your problem? This is like how stuff builds on each other. It's kinda like algebra. Now if you if you miss, like, three minus x equals one, how to solve that, when you get to a advanced quadratic equation or whatever the crap they're called later, like, then you can't you have no hope. Right? Yep. And so, like, Nate and I, I can remember, we would sometimes we could tell if somebody did do discovery based on are they doing a generic demo, or did the headline say, we're helping you over 1,000 to 2,000 band pipeline gen, and here's the three things I'm gonna show you to show that. The inability to do that says that you haven't discovered correct correctly Yep. Which probably means the rep is trying to win the deal with product and the demo. And that is not how sales is done right now. Maybe five years ago, you could win on that kind of stuff, but not now because everything looks like magic with AI. But this is like the building. You gotta once you get the big w of the problem, that gives you everything you need to then get a w in the demo. Yep. But if you don't get the w in the the discovery, there's no way to get a w after that. Is it there's no comeback. There's hardly any comeback victories in sales. Once you're behind, it's hard to catch back up. Well, Nate, this was an amazing show. I am stoked for the recap. But before we end, you were actually the second guest to go through our new ending bit. It's not one question. It is the final four. These are four rapid fire leadership questions that are meant to be answered in, like, as short form as possible. Alright? You ready? Let's go. And we're gonna rotate these every single quarter. Number one, what's your number one interview question? Number one question, use this to assess grit. What's the story of your life? Takes about fifteen minutes, and people who have overcome significant adversity, where they've had to pull themselves up with the bootstraps, had to overcome something, can give you a very detailed answer as to what happened, what did they do, how they overcome that. Number two, what is the number one culture killer on a sales floor? Tolerating poor, poor behavior straight up. Right? So, typically, we tolerate it for the benefit of a short term result, but every time I've made that mistake, it's always had a negative consequence on the team, the culture, or long term results. What's an example of, like, poor behavior? Maybe treating our, like, our cross functional partners poorly. Right? So it's treating, like, a transactional relationship, blaming, pointing fingers, etcetera, etcetera, versus, hey. We're on the same side of the table. Right? And and they might get the result of where that SC or that, you know, implementation team, is gonna lean in and help them out for that deal. But that second, third, fourth deal that comes down the pipeline, third, we wanna have nothing to do with that rep, because of how they were treating on that first, that first term. Number three. Yeah. What's the number one thing you can do to earn your team's respect? I think for newer leaders, quick wins. Like, find them wherever you can. Right? So right now, I'm day 10. So where can I hop on calls? Where can I make connections? Where can I unstuck things? What are what are the top items that came up, during my skip levels and didn't know the team. Right? And try try to knock down everything I possibly can really quickly to show momentum and show that I got their back. If you're an established leader, like, I did outreach for, like, six years. I think the you know, towards the end, it was more about process refinement. Right? It's about, like, hey. Look. Like, you know, what was working three years ago isn't working today. So how do we continue to retool? Right? And and actually doing that, doing it a demonstrative way, winning the PR game, if you will. Right? Like, hey. I heard you. I hear the problem. There's what we're working on it. Here's the plan we're taking. We're gonna roll this out in q three. You know, help some of the way. And the last one, what's the number one way to get promoted as a sales leader? Start leading from your seat. You can be a leader as an IC. You can help others. You can cheer others on. You can bring, problems and solutions to your leaders. Right? But just start leading. I'll give a personal story here to end it, and and, you know, Mark knows as well because he was a a chief, you know, participant in this. Right? Prior to me working for Mark, all I cared about was titles and more money. I went on a journey of of self reflection and and and all these things before I started working for Mark. And I realized that, hey. Listen. The the the pathway where I'm gonna focus on is just providing value in my seat. Right? I'm saying just just provide value from where I sit. Right? Don't worry about the next thing. Just do what you're doing in the seat. Right? And quite literally, for me personally, the second that I made that switch, the promotions, the titles, the money, everything literally followed, like I think we had two or three promotions there, Mark, where I didn't even know they were coming. I didn't ask for them. Like, it was just I showed up one day and said, alright. Here we go. Right? Which is which is a beautiful thing. Right? So when I see with the ICs, like, it look it's like, just start leading. Right? Start participating. Start being because when you're an IC promoting the sales leader for the first time, it should be really obvious. Nobody on the sales floor should question, oh, that person got she got promoted. Of course, she did. She was the heir apparent. It was so obvious that it was gonna be her. In fact, as a as a rep, I would welcome working for her because she was how she was showing up, this whole time. Right? So it should be it should be obvious. Alrighty, folks. You got another new bit here. We got a three step recap and one thing you can do. So your three step recap is as follows. Step number one, you wanna map out your sales process step by step and write down what your reps need to do before each call, what they need to do during each call, and then what they need to do after each call. Step two, once you have that, identify the big w or the big win for each call, and then give them three, four, five different ways they can get that big win, but do not overprescribe. And then lastly, number three, once you're ready to roll this thing out, you're gonna meet with your team for one hour per stage, and you're gonna break down the big w and the key things they can do to get that big w. And that's how you change your sales process. Alrighty, Mark. What is one thing that everyone can do right now? Take your sales process. Take one stage where you feel like your team is doing poorly. Take everything that you know about that process and boil it down to just one thing. If we do this, we win two to one and nine innings. It doesn't matter if we win 15 to one. Win's a win. And then what you should do is for two weeks, have every single meeting that happens inside that stage, have your managers listen to the call and determine was the win accomplished. Don't let your reps do it. Managers need to do it and see what your win rate is. That will tell you if you need to work on the basics of that stage or if you're ready to move on to a different place. And if you got one way that you could help us out here, well, folks, it's actually gonna help you. Mark broke down his five stage sales process, and it's the sales process that I've modeled my own off of as well. We're gonna include a newsletter write up to that breakdown of the five stages, the exit criteria for each, and what you should do in each stage down below in the show notes. Go check it out. And if you like it, subscribe to the newsletter, folks. We'll catch you on the next one.
