## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. I'm your host, Nick Sigelski, joined with my co host, Jen Allen Knuth. And today, we have got Tom Williams, who is the head of Clari Align and former CEO over at DealPoint. Jen, why should people listen? Tom was speaking my love language on this one, Nick. We talk a lot about building a point of view, delivering a point of view, how you show up and add value to the customer instead of simply extracting answers to our discovery questions. And a three, a two, a one, listen to Tom speak Jen's love language. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Tom. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Number one, write down your POV. Make sure that the customer actually agrees with it. So it's fine to get it wrong. And oftentimes we're talking about making sure that you're validated with the customer. If you write it down, then you have the opportunity for them to see one, that you're listening and that you care. And two, if they correct it, now they're invested with you to make something better together. Your credibility will go through the roof and your manager is gonna give you less stick because you really have qualified this customer a lot better than normal. I love it. What's number two? Number two, visualize the deal beyond the customer wants it to the customer's CFO is confident that there's actually gonna happen. So many deals have died even though the champion loves it. The CFO is the adult in the room. They're not thinking about how you're gonna make the champion's life better. They're thinking about the other impacts on other parts of the business. So unless you can prove to that CFO that there's a really safe path to making this thing happen, you're gonna be in a real hard situation when they're saying, I don't think we need this right now. Beautiful. Round us out. What's number three? Number three, multi thread is a two way street. So we all know that we're supposed to multi thread, but a lot of buyers think of this in terms of I need to talk to my 7.8 people over on the buying committee. In fact, it really is just as important for the buyers to know that there's multi thread the other direction. They don't wanna just be gatekept by the seller. They want to be able to talk to the people, their peers over on the selling side. This does two things. First of all, it boosts your credibility as a seller that you have this army of people who are standing behind you ready and willing to help this customer solve the problem. Two, it helps the customer understand that they have access to the people over on the selling team which makes them feel better. And then three, your manager sees that you are doing good multithreading. So they're gonna, again, be less likely to critique you when they're doing the deal inspection. Awesome. Okay. So your three actionable takeaways, Tom, this is my sales love language. I am so excited to pick your brain on this topic. Let's start at the very top. So I'm a new seller. I hear you say you've gotta show up with a point of view, and you've gotta show it to the customer. Let's take it, like, very step one. What exactly do you mean by bringing a point of view? Is it a point of view about your product? What is it when you say point of view? So a point of view is about the customers either their business or their job role. And you know something about their business or their job role that they don't know that you can do better than them and make them be better either doing the job that they do or making their company better. The point of view comes from the thing that your company has built over the years that does something better than what they do by themselves. And when you come in with a point of view you're saying there are probably some symptoms that you have and I understand what the root cause of that is and I can tell you how to fix it. So that point of view is coming in as an educated person about their business or about their job role and being brave enough to say I think I can help you do better than you're doing today, Let's discuss. Now it's not gonna be perfect, but you start like a world view of what I think there's not enough buyer collaboration in the world. So my point of view is I wonder if we talked about it more or if we got them to give more, we would be better off. That's what my point of view is and I apply that when I'm talking to customers. I remember back when I first started selling, I was, like, 23 years old. I walked into a division of GE, sat down with the CMO of their team, and I was, like, why on earth would they care about my point of view? I'm 23 years old. I have no worldview. So what advice do you give to sellers that are starting off of how they actually develop that worldview and turn it into a point of view to bring into that meeting? Yeah. I mean, it is really easy for your CEO to walk in with a legitimate point of view and just start spouting about all the philosophy of how the world could be a better place. As a rep, you are representing this company. So when I say your own point of view, it really it's taking the thing that your company does better than anybody else in the world, the thing that they know that nobody else knows and expressing that, representing that. The number one easiest way to own that point of view and to bring it into your own heart is to go and talk to senior people in your own company. Go ask for a meeting with somebody two, three levels above you and say, I'm trying to develop the point of view about our product. Could I take you out to lunch? And you get a couple of things out of this. You get an unfiltered perspective of what true leaders say and do. They see that you're a curious kind of person who wants to have a better point of view and wants to really enunciate the values of the company. And three, I guarantee you that person will buy you lunch. So free lunch, much better selling, and a swift rise to the top because you're noted as being a high flyer. I really love this one because I can put away a lunch. You know, sometimes there's salespeople who are like, wait, that seems kinda scary to go talk to someone three levels above me in my company. We're a big organization. Well, you're literally cold calling COOs all day, salesperson listening to this. You better feel comfortable reaching out to someone more senior in your own organization. Yep. People don't go to conferences and trade shows as much as they used to but if you are at a trade show and there is a lull that is the time to get your senior leaders point of view and start enunciating and practicing it and feeding it back. They will love you for it, and they'll remember you for it. And it will come back to benefit you in months and years to come. I'd love to ask you how you position or set up the presentation of your point of view? Because my guess is, if, Tom, you're the sales rep and you're sitting down with Jen, and she's how do you say, hey, I'm about to share my point of view with you in a way that actually gets them to say, okay, let me listen for a second. So you had a twenty second cold call, you got to the fifteen, twenty minute, half an hour, I don't really know you, but you had a good pitch kind of thing. What I like to do is I like to talk about two shared truths and then something that they didn't realize. So if you call out something, what I like to think of as a symptom in their business, and you can say, I saw the symptom either in real life where your company is having a dip or I saw your messaging on this blog post here. This is a symptom of one of your observations, one of those parts of your point of view. Do you see that too? And do that for two things that you think that they'll recognize and they'll go, Yeah, that is something true about my business. Then hit them with a third symptom that maybe ideally they haven't seen yet because then they'll go, this guy nailed two of them, maybe the third one is true and I didn't know about it. Talk about the symptoms first that are quantifiable and provable. And then the point of view part is those are your symptoms and they're actually caused by a single root cause problem. Now in Clari World, for example, we would say that the root cause problem of a lot of people's sales issues is they don't have very good analytics. They're not looking carefully enough in which parts of their business are changing in real time. And so they're operating on bad assumptions. That's the root cause of the problem. And then in that first half hour call, I like to actually put a little bit of proof in the pudding and show a really quick demo to see what it could look like. But keep it to the very end so they don't have time to get stuck into, well, how do I change my logo color? But more, this is how we've taken these insights and this root cause and built a solution around it. Okay. So a lot of sellers, when they came up in selling, were trained of I have to ask the customer questions, they give me something back, then I turn around probably a week later and say, here's the perfect solution. So if I'm a seller that's been trained in that manner, how do I reconcile what you're talking about on the first call? What am I doing to be able to ask questions and make sure I've got a good fit while still coming in with a point of view that shows I, one, have some credibility, but I also know what I'm talking about in the subject matter. What I like to do, I like to write down my point of view and where I've done some research on that customer, and I've jotted down a couple of notes about what I think is true or or what I think might be happening. And I literally flash that up on the screen and say, this is what I think might be happening. By showing it, first of all, you're being brave and exposing yourself because you may well be wrong. So there's a acknowledgement of bravery. Second, there's an acknowledgement that you've done some work and you didn't just roll in for this and that you're the kind of person who writes things down. All of those are positive traits and would make me want to work with you. As long as it's not like radically wrong, then they'll say, yeah, that is an issue that we've been facing but we tried something already, we tried to fix it or we think we've got it to a good enough situation where it's manageable or something where you're able to now sharpen your point of view. And ideally at that point you can come up with that second or third symptom that maybe they haven't thought about that deepens the pain. Because if they come back and say, yeah, we did think we fixed that problem already then you might have just disqualified yourself out of a deal unless you can get them to dig a little bit deeper But you've earned that right because you showed them something and you showed them that you've put a little bit of time and effort into it, which goes a long way just human to human level. So one of the things I wanna call out that you did that I'm such a fan of is your language choice. You use the words might, maybe, looks like. I think as sellers, sometimes we are so scared of being wrong that we are fearful of having an opinion on something. And I think what I heard in the way that you delivered that is you are inviting them to correct you. And humans love to correct. It's nothing to be scared of. Right? I want you to correct me because when you correct me, I learn new information. I wanna call it out because I think that is one of the things that sellers really are fearful of is just being called out as being wrong. It's fantastic if you're wrong or being told that you're wrong. If they don't correct you, that's actually arguably worse because it means you completely got it wrong or they don't care about you. Tom, one of the things that I expected coming in this interview was I thought you were just gonna talk about a lot of the same stuff that we've talked about related to mutual action plans, and, oh, it's really good to document all the steps you're supposed to do. And then you said something to me and Jen in the preshow where you were talking about earning the right to collaborate with your buyer or getting them to even want to do that. And you were talking about the idea of presenting a business case before we go through a mutual action plan. And I'm wondering if you can talk about that in the context of, like, why a lot of sellers are failing or struggling with using mutual action plans when selling. Yeah, it's really easy. If you have a plan to a place you don't want to go, I'm not really that interested in it. So the way a successful deal happens is first of all, they need to want it. And that means that you've proven that they have an urgent and important problem. You've proven that it's too risky for them not to do anything. And arguably, you've proven that it's gonna be hassle for them to do it themselves. So those are three pretty big steps before you've ever talked about your software or how to make it happen. So they need to want that business outcome a lot and you should spend an awful lot of time on that because until that point, they're not going to dig in deep. Now, I would say there's a very good case for your disqualification purposes of showing the plan pretty early to say this is going to be a six month problem that we need to solve together. And if they say I only have 50¢ and I need it done tomorrow and I'm out of here, then you can save yourself a whole bunch of time. But in terms of them actually digging into the mutual action plan and really getting engaged, they need to want that outcome already deeply. Otherwise, you're gonna be wasting your time. When you talk about business cases, I feel like a lot of times we sellers run right to ROI. And we're like, let me just put a big fat number on it, and I'm gonna show you how great the world will be if you buy from us. You mentioned something in the preshow about your take on ROI and what you do instead. I imagine that's part of how you construct the business case. Can you take us through how you help that customer understand really the cost of not solving the problem to begin with before you get into ROI? Because I think it's a really important point in business case building. There's this horrible secret in ROI calculators that they have all these inputs everywhere and somewhere there's a single cell that just multiplies by 1.2. The cells don't even do anything and everybody has this little cheetah multiplier. So I don't believe when a vendor says you're going to get 10000% ROI and they don't believe it when you put it in because you multiply something by 1.2 and it ends up being a fantastic return, like on their entire bottom line. Instead, I focus on what the pain is and kind of what the delta is between them doing it right and doing it wrong. Not if you buy my stuff, you'll be 1.2% better because that is meaningless because you don't even know where they started. So you don't know how good or bad they are. And you're just multiplying it by 120%. Instead, if you say, and this is a great way to do this, if there's been change recently. So you ask them to compare this quarter with last quarter or last year's numbers to this year's numbers. And there's a downward trend, say, well, what's that delta been? If everything was working like it did before pandemic, for example, what would your bottom line look like? And they say, well, we're down $40,000,000 from pre pandemic. And then you're drilling into, well, why do you think that is? And your insight is that they didn't successfully go from being a trade show based sales company to a online company. They just didn't nail that. Luckily you have a way for them to bump up their pipeline back to those old numbers. So I'm not going to improve a business by 120%. I'm going to get you that $40,000,000 or let's say half of that $40,000,000 delta because I identified the problem that you actually have and there's a quantifiable price or cost to that problem. And I didn't talk about percentages. Tom, one of the things I've been struggling with, because I've been trying to do this more when I sell our sponsorship sales at thirty minutes to presidents club, is I'm trying to have conversations with some of the the VPs of marketing and CMOs that I sell to, and I'll ask them for basic data about their business to help inform a a case that we're putting together. And they don't always know. And I'm sitting here and I'm like, the hell am I supposed to do? One of the funny things is before I started working at Clari and before I founded Dealpoint Online, I worked at an audio test and measurement company, and I was actually with my kids at an indoor swimming pool just a couple of months ago. And I suddenly realized I'm actually still in the test and measurement business at Clari. I never left. I hadn't realized that I'm still doing test and measurement. So I would say there is a lot to be said for helping your customers even quantify what their problems are. So if they say, I can't come up with the numbers, then you have a fantastic opportunity to come in as a consultative helper and earn some credibility to say, I can help you figure out the numbers. Why don't we look at your Salesforce together or sign the NDA or something that you know will let them get to that decision point? Because if they don't know the numbers, then they're not gonna buy your stuff. Why would they? Because you can't even measure if it's been successful or not. So setting up some baseline criteria of what does good look like is predicated on the idea that you can measure stuff and you can add immense value of teaching them how to measure stuff. And now suddenly you're a rock star. These are the three KPIs that you should be looking at in your pipeline investments. And you're already ahead of the game versus the other guys who say you should buy my stuff because you'll get a 120% better performance. That answer just, like, fills my soul because I think that is that moment where you turn the table. So when I was selling challenger sales training, nobody wanted to buy sales training. Sales training is the last thing people wanna buy. And so one of the things that we were trying to do is say, look, You've got a status quo problem. But no one ever knew how to measure a status quo problem. But when you give someone a framework and say, hey. Go back in your CRM. See how many deals have not had a conversation in sixty to ninety days and how much of that is forecasted pipeline. All of a sudden now someone's got a number for it. And when you give someone a number of the problem, now they can shop the number around and the pain around as opposed to shopping the solution around. And that's the other thing, Tom, that I heard you do, which was none of that conversation was about your solution. And it's all about sizing. Right. Exactly. You're putting it in the right order because you've gotta have a problem to buy a solution. So I think that's another big takeaway from what you're describing is move away from our attachment to the solution and focus first on the development of of helping them look at the problem the same way that we do. That's the other way that you hone your POV is by doing this a bunch of times and just being punched in the face and getting it wrong. I feel like a lot of buyers have been trained to expect advancing monkey of a salesperson, and they expect you to show them a demo. Give me your pitch. How do you push back and reframe the scope of the interaction? There's two things there. First of all, I remember one of my favorite sales calls ever back when I was in IC, I cold called this guy, he ran a car dealership in Rhode Island for what it's worth, and I started to go down my discovery questions and he goes, Hey, man, you called me. Why don't you tell me what you're selling? And I was like, I love this guy because the fact is, for all this discovery that we're trying to do, what they think they want is just just show me the goddamn software and I'll tell you if it's going to fix my problem or not. A lot of the time that's a perfectly legitimate situation. And so I think one of the important things in discovery is how far down their urgent important problem analysis have they already gone? And real early on, if they're like, Yeah, you know, we've done the metrics, we've done the analysis, we know what's wrong with our pipeline, it's this. And I'm looking for a way to increase the number of enterprise deals that we have coming through Southeast Asia. There's not a whole lot of problem identification that I need to do there, and so it really is legitimate for me to skip. I can validate that we have the same root cause problem. But if they've done the work, then don't make them run through that process just to satisfy you. You've got to establish where are they, especially if they've reached out to you, then some of these initial urgent problem things don't apply. So what I want to do is I want to honour the request. I will always say at the top of that thirty minute call and I always say literally these words, I swear to God, I will show a demo before we hang up the phone today. But before I know what to show, I have to understand a little bit more because the product can do loads of stuff. What I don't want to do is just show you the product and then you go, that's really cool because that doesn't that doesn't do anything for either of us. I'm in the luxurious position that we sell to sellers, so I can be a lot more frank about it. But even if you're not selling to a seller, just I swear to God, I will show you the demo. Let me ask a couple of questions first and understand why we built the software first and go back to that framework of you can do nothing, you can do it yourself, or you can go with a vendor. I like this framework because it puts you on the same side of the table as the customer and it disarms them. It makes them realize, okay, maybe this guy isn't just trying to sell me whatever I have no matter what. By saying, absolutely, you could do this by yourself. You can do anything by yourself. We need to investigate if it is cost effective for you to spend all that time building like something similar to what we built. If it's worth figuring out how are you going to support maintenance requests or security breaches, or when one of those libraries that you're using goes out of date and you need to upgrade the dependencies, or how are you going to roll it out to your team, And do you have training materials and everything ready? Because it's not just building the stuff. The solution is rarely the actual expensive part of making software. It's all the apparatus around it. So if you commit to saying figure it out as an expensive problem, that's costing you a lot. Let's look at what it would take for you guys to fix it by yourselves. And then the really cool thing is by looking at what it takes for them to fix it, you are literally building out your business case of value, because then you can present to the CFO. These are the things that you would need to do in order to fix this big expensive problem. I can do it for dramatically less money and less risk because what I actually like to do is put a timeline. I like to put a timeline on here's the problem, here's the solution, what milestones would you have to do if you're doing this by yourself? Then I show how much risk there is in each of those points where something would go wrong if you decide to try to fix this problem for the first time having never done it before, then I show the much safer, faster route. It costs more money, but it doesn't cost more resource and it certainly doesn't cost more risk to go with my route and then they can compare for themselves And you've done this kickass discovery on understanding, like, who the players are on their team so that you can put a really strong both business case and implementation plan in front of the CFO for them to sign with their gold pen. Tom, this is brilliant. And I have to imagine there are some folks listening to this thinking, oh, gosh. I really wanna do that. I don't even know how to start putting something like that together. And I'm wondering, do you think there's a world we can document what you just talked about and maybe give it to the audience for free? The sole answer is yes. I have this all carefully written down. I'm happy to share that stuff. Folks, check the show notes. We'll, we'll have something linked for you all so you can just steal from Tom's brilliance. So I got one more question for you, Tom. I want to make this really real for folks who are trying to build almost like the anti business case that ends up being in their favor, where it's like, Hey, let's look at all the ways that you could do this yourself and the cost factors at play. And you mentioned a couple, right? Like, you build this in house, you're gonna need training documentation. There's infrastructure and security support. Are there other things that sellers should be thinking about when they're trying to build the, hey. You probably shouldn't do this in house case? The biggest hidden cost is in implementation, rollout, and then adoption. Okay. Well, customer success essentially. No one ever thinks about portal customer success and they will have an even bigger problem with customer success because they think they just did this on the side to fix a little problem. But in fact, they're going to need to have ongoing and they don't have the documentation or as nice a UI or any of the other friction solvers that a proper product has. The other thing that's going to kill them is they're going to come out with their first release and they're going to think they're done. If it's any good at all, then their user base is gonna ask for something different and is never gonna be never ending of constant improvements Yeah. On a product that really wasn't built for it. So then they're gonna get this really horrible situation where they didn't design it right in the first place and it's not extensible. It was 80% good. It was a really nice spreadsheet, but now we need 30 people in there and they're messing around with the formulas. What do you do? So it looks great for the first week before it gets really hit by the users and at that point they're going to be asking things that would require a radical rebuild. And I know this because we have to do radical rebuilds all the time as the assumptions that we made out of the gate turn out not to be right. And so we had to suck it up and do more engineering. That's not because we're morons. It's because we didn't know. And it's gonna be the same, especially if it's a side project for a company. I love it. Tom, we could do this interview for hours and hours, but we're running out of time. And so we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so my final question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? It kills me when people open up the screen share from the very first second of the call, and then for the next half hour, I'm looking at whatever slide we last stopped on. In my opinion, the second you pull that screen up, you stop conversation, you can't see their eyes properly, they can't see your emotions. And there's a very good chance that they're thinking about something else or looking at something else. So you've got to get comfortable opening and closing that share screen only as you need it for like the graph or the chart or the thing that's important for what you're explaining or asking about and then close it again. And now we're talking as humans, pop back up again, talking as humans. Don't just have the slide up all the time because you will kill conversation. Oh, I've loved talking as humans with you today, Tom. Thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for sixty second recap coming up soon. Thank you all so much. I really enjoyed it.

Number one, help your customer build a bear case for why they shouldn't be trying to build your software in house on their own. You should be teaching them, yo, it's kind of expensive to handle training, maintenance, support documentation, customization of software, and, like, that's our entire business. We can do it for you. When you can show the delta between what it would cost them and what just buying your software looks like, you will make a great case for yourself. Number two. If you're having trouble building your own POV, hit up a senior exec at your company and ask to get lunch with them to help you build one. You have so many wonderful benefits of this. One, you get to establish credibility in your company as someone who is actually trying to move the needle. Two, you're gonna learn a ton and develop a relationship with someone that you'll help you in the rest of your career. And three, this is most important, you might get some free guacamole at lunch. It's not a thirty minutes to President's Club episode if you don't talk about guacamole. Number three, don't show up to your first call expecting the customer to do all of the hard work answering your questions. Instead, bring a point of view to the call that introduces a new way of looking at a root cause of a problem you think they might have. And number four, speaking of that POV, if you're going to an event, use that as an opportunity to test that point of view with other executives that are attending and maybe coming up to your booth or maybe sitting next to you at a session. Those reps will help you get more comfortable delivering the POV, and you'll also learn a lot about potential objections that they might give you so you can be prepared for that in a sales call. Now, Nick, how can listeners help us out? They can help us out by helping themself out because Tom was so, so generous, just like that executive who's buying you chips, guac, and maybe even some fajitas. Tom has agreed to be giving away some free licenses of Clari Align and some templates embedded with mutual action plans that you can steal, use, and help get your deals closer to close so that you can buy your own block and not have to pilfer it from your senior executives' expense reports. Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week on the show.
