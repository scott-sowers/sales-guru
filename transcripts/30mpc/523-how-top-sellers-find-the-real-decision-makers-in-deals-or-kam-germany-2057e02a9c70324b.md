## Transcript

And you have to be open to them saying, I just think your product sucks. And then I can say, okay. Well, compared to what? Sometimes people are worried about asking for the feedback because they don't have an answer for certain things, and that's okay. But the idea is if you have some feedback that doesn't go in my favor, it's typically because you have something in your mind that you're comparing me to. And if I can get that, then we're in the game. Cam, I'm really worried about implementation, and we haven't talked about it yet, and I don't wanna go through one. Okay. Why? What happened previously that makes you feel like an implementation with us is gonna be so much worse? Now I can actually start having a real conversation with it. And then once I give my spiel around how we're not gonna be that way, then I go back and say, was that enough? Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my host, Nick Sigelski. And, folks, we have a special guest that brings forward one of the most painful memories of my life. You know, I've competed on many sales floors. And, Nick, on almost every sales floor, I cracked the number one spot. There was one time I did not where I was stuck in the position of number two. And that number two slot was held behind our guest today, Cam Germany. So Cam Germany was a top 2% intern when we were selling insurance together at Northwestern Mutual. He then joined the team over at Carta where he led multiple initiatives, was a top performer there. He is now selling to HR and payroll where he is a president's club rep. And in his prep doc, he also wrote, taught Armond everything he knows obviously. And this episode is an extremely obvious reason why Cam is so damn good of a seller and an awesome friend. Nick, why should people listen? We got into some really unique stuff in this episode about mapping the shadow org of who actually makes decisions at the company you're selling to, and Cam gives some ways that he figures out who the real DM in a decision is. He also talks about this. We we've, like, really not heard much about this approach before. He is not setting a next step, Armand. He is setting five next steps coming out of a meeting, and we'll talk about what he's doing there and how that is injecting massive velocity into his deals. And then we go into what he's doing to make sure when he gets in front of the executives for, like, the grand hurrah presentation, how he nails it every single time. So if you are selling a complex sale that requires multiple people to weigh in, that touches multiple parts of an org, this was a master class. Oh, and, folks, before their episode rolls, I've got a little challenge for you. I want you to count the number of times that juice is said by me, Cam, and Armand in this episode. And if you listen all the way to the end, I've got a little Easter egg for you. Three, two, one. Juice. Cam, welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Number one, you need to identify the shadow decision maker. Who is the person in the room that has the juice to get this deal moving and across the line? And sometimes, a really important part about this is that person's title doesn't always indicate their influence in the deal and where this thing's going to go. So example, one of the deals that I worked earlier this year, large company, had six different warehouses growing like crazy. I got in with the VP of HR, and as we went through the meetings, I started realizing this guy was gonna be the one that was gonna take us across the line even though he wasn't CFO, CEO, COO, because it was family owned business. And the new CEO was kind of the son who hadn't done a bunch of internal work yet, and so he was really relying heavily on my VP of HR to make sure whatever decision was made enterprise wide, that guy signed off on because he knew how to get it done. Another step to that would also be try to get as many players that you think gonna be involved in the decision in the room as early as possible. And then what you can do is start thinking about things like tenure and relationship, and you start to learn the actual internal politics and dynamics of the room, of all these different people versus just saying, hey. My CFO is gonna be the guy or gal that's making all financial decisions. I should just, you know, blitz them with as many calls, text, emails as I can. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Very nice. What's number two? Number two is inciting the riot. It's one of my favorite things to do. But after I've realized that we have a a real case here, I wanna go with every single person that's a part of that decision making kind of cohort, and I wanna get the pitchforks and torches going. I wanna see what every single person individually, typically without the decision maker in the room, could a little more open to expressing what's going on day to day. And I wanna get everything that's wrong, every issue they have, the things that are keeping them up at night, why they can't go on vacation because of what's happening in their role. Select all that data and then take that back as we start to formulate a real SOW and what we can do to help the organization. Awesome. Brown us out, Cam. What's number three? Yeah. The last one is making sure that you're coachable and that you can be coached. And what I mean by that is you're doing all this work to find a solution for this organization. We now know that they want it just as bad as we do, but you don't wanna go in there in your first run of showing a presentation to the decision makers and not have any context. And so what I'll do is I'll go to my people in the account. I'll go to the the pitchfork and torch people. I'll go to my champion, and I'll say, hey. Before we walk in there, can we actually walk through this presentation? How does your decision maker like to see information? How do they what's their personality? Are they more data driven? Is it more feeling driven? Are they gonna rely heavily on you? Is it gonna be a monetary decision? I wanna know all these things and have them pick apart my presentation. So when we walk in there to say yes or no to this entire organization, I already know the objections. I know how to spin this conversation to make sure that we're putting ourselves in the most advantageous position. So let's start with this concept of the shadow decision maker in your deal. In other words, you might normally drive a sale home with a CEO or a CFO, but there might be, like, a chief of staff or a chief HR officer that actually pulls all the strings internally. So one of the tactics you talked about was getting multiple people in a room to figure out who's the real decision maker. So let's say that you have a room or give me, like, a deal example where you had multiple people in the room. What did you ask or observe to figure out who actually pulled the strings? Yeah. Great question. So I was working with a hospice company recently, and I got in the deal through, you know, normal cadence of trying to get in. I got a really kind of low level HR assistant, and it was great. She was super knowledgeable. And so when I set the meeting, she's like, hey. I'm actually gonna bring in three or four people from the organization as well. Awesome. So we walk in the room, three or four people here. I'm doing my introduction, and I'll usually start off with something high level. Hey. Walk me through, some of the complications of the process for just sourcing talent and getting them to come to your hospice care facility. And so people start answering questions. The next question becomes, okay. Well, walk me through what's wrong with that scenario. What is actually causing you angst? Because it's a very competitive industry, I wanna make sure I'm understanding where some of the hiccups may or may not be. More information, one or two people chime in. Then I asked the impact question. This is where we start to figure out who the actual big dog in the room is. I said, okay. Great. Well, given what you've shared with me and given that I know that you are trying to grow 20 to 30% in the next twelve to eighteen months, how does your current system support you or affect that growth grow in totality for the entire organization? It gets really quiet. And then typically, the person with the most juice starts to answer the question because that person is the one that's paid to connect the dots between actionable items every single day and business objectives. And as soon as you get that information from that person, we now know, okay. Irrespective of title, this person knows what's going on. This person is now connecting the dots from a simple applicant tracking system to 30% year over year growth. And then what I'll do is I'll say, hey, Nick. Thank you so much for walking me through kind of how that's connected to your business objectives. So connecting the dots a bit more, when we talk about talent management, development, things like that, what are you and the team doing Mhmm. To couple the the production of finding new talent and keeping the talent here? Can you walk me through that? And what typically happens is Nick gives a very detailed business oriented option or answer to me, And then he goes, Arman, can you elaborate more, give Cam some more color here? And now I have now shifted the conversation to say Nick is the guy. Mhmm. You all in some way, shape, or form, be it politically or by title, are looking to Nick for some guidance, And now he's going to give me leeway to all the people that are doing more specific things that Nick is passing on. And now I've identified who the big dog in the room is. One thing that you were talking about in your second takeaway was the concept of inciting this riot where you are going from this first meeting and this deal that you're talking about. Let's continue this deal. You got in with a lower level HR person. She gets you into a room with four people. You now identify using your language who's got the juice, and then maybe there's some other people with lower levels of juice. Folks like you, Armand. I need some juice. What what are you doing in the wrap of this meeting as you are setting next steps or talking about how you continue the conversation so that you're not losing contact with all of these other stakeholders to use your words? Like, you need to to incite that riot. Yeah. Yeah. Great question. So what I'm doing at the end of the conversation, we've had some pain. We've identified the fact that we can help in some way, shape, or form. What I'll typically do is ask for kind of a social contract. So what I'm gonna say is, you know, Nick, Arman, team, we really appreciate you all giving me an hour, hour and a half, two hours of time, even more than I probably asked for upfront. It sounds like everyone kinda has something to add to this conversation. I wanna make sure I'm aware of that. So I'm just gonna silo off probably fifteen to twenty minutes with each of you individually before we do the demonstration in a week or two. And so you'll get those calendar invites from me here right when we wrap up this meeting. That way, I can make sure everyone gets an opportunity to share with me their portion of the pie. And when we come back, the demonstration will be far more tailored to make sure we're hitting every single point of what's actually happening from the business day to day, and then we connect it back to that 20 to 30% growth. Does that work for you all? Everyone always says yes because everyone wants their day in court. Everyone wants to be heard. And typically in these evaluations, those entry level people who are actually physically going in the system and doing all the grunt work don't get a say in the decision. And so all of a sudden, I'm taking my torch and I'm lighting the one next to me, and then he or she's lighting the next one because they now have the opportunity to talk to me one off with nobody else in the room, pressuring them to say the right thing or to make their job seem better than it is currently, and they can just talk freely. And I could take the information and make it sound good enough to then go back to my champion, my decision maker, and say, hey. Not sure if you're fully aware I'm on, but here's all the stuff that the team's actually doing. I'm sure you're not aware because your team is great, and they're taking a lot of the brunt of the of what the system limitations are. Let me explain to what that actually looks like and why you're not seeing that stuff in your desk every single day. Now I got the riot going on right every single day. They're talking to each other at the water cooler. They're keeping the pitchforks and torches lit, but I'm also bigging them up to the decision maker and and the champion saying, hey. These people are crushing it. Let me tell you how we can actually make them far more efficient than what's going on. So to recap and, Arman, I'll let you ask about what happens in those isolation meetings. Folks, Cam is not setting one next step. He's actually setting five next steps at the end of the meeting. It is one on one breakouts, which e with each of those four people in the room and a deeper presentation based on what you learned in the call you're heading right now, plus those breakouts that happens in, like, a week or two weeks. And this actually reminds me of a strategy that I learned from Lynn Powers who was, one of the top reps at a company called Clari. And I think she actually closed the biggest deal in Clari history. This was a couple years ago, but she talks about the same approach of she'll meet with an executive. She'll get permission from that executive to get access to everyone on that exec's team, but then she will also schedule a meeting two or three weeks out with that executive to say, hey. I'm gonna go talk to your team over the next couple weeks, but you and I are gonna meet again, and I'm gonna share what I learned. And that's how you inject real velocity into your deals. You're not going linear. You're going multiple paths with multiple peoples all in parallel with each other. Exactly. Exactly. It's nothing like when you can get referred down or referred across from somebody in position of power, the world's your oyster. Right? Because now if I know Nick is the CEO and the CEO cc's me on the email saying, hey. I spoke to Cam. Yeah. He's gonna be reaching out to all you with time. You're guaranteed one, two, three, four, however meetings I need Yeah. With a backstop to your point of that demonstration two weeks out. So everybody knows, no matter what's happening, I'm gonna get thirty minutes on your calendar in the next five day five to seven days. Guaranteed. So, So, Cam, what's an example of, like, hidden deal intel that you've gotten in one of these meetings that you would not have normally gotten if it was in a big room? A big one is always, typically how people are sharing information around what else is going on. So very few times in the sales space with everybody on this call, everyone listening, do you walk into a deal, whether you cold call it or was a lead or something like that, and you're the only player. It hardly ever happens. Right? In the SaaS space, it's so easy to reach out to multiple people at once, and we're all calling all the time. We're all in thirty minutes presidents club practicing all this stuff. It's easy. And so what I'll do is when I have a really good champion or I'm having this one off conversation and I'm allowing this person to open up in this one on one environment, I'm like, hey, Arman. I'm sure you are talking to quite a few working pair, which is definitely normal in decision making process. Where are you in that process? You know, my company notwithstanding. Great. You get whatever spiel. And I only might get one or two points. I don't wanna bleed this person in the first date. Right? And then I'll say, okay. Well, we're gonna go through this. We're gonna finish up our time here for thirty minutes or so. But as we're going through the evaluation, I meet with the other teams, I may circle back on a few things that pop up based on their feedback as well. Is that okay? Mhmm. Yeah. Of course. Great. And now I can spend the block in two weeks later and say, hey, Amaron. Where are you at with pricing with some of our competitors? I know you are nearing the end. Nick, you know, CFO said we're waiting on a few more proposals. Where is that? Where are you? How are my competitors coming in? Have you all eliminated anybody? If so, why? And now we're on this one to one sharing information because I know this person has now chosen me and chosen my company as a place they wanna go, and now we're in it together. Now we both put the same thing. And so now anytime I'm not there, they're fighting the fight, and they're helping eliminate my competitors because we're on this one to one basis. And that's when you really get the deal moving, and you start to get some of that high level intel that typically c suites won't share unless we're in a straight up competition. And they just wanna boat race everybody and say, all you guys do the same thing. Here's the four quotes I've got. Can you beat it? Which at that point, you know, do you wanna be in a deal like that? Typically, not really. So you're asking about competition in these one offs. Are there other threads that you're pulling on where it's like, hey. Tell me what's going on because everyone else isn't in the room. Like, it's making me think a little of a we have this guy Sean O'Brien on our show, and he talks about the concept of he'll, like, boot his call recorder and kind of make a show of booting the call recorder to be like, hey. Talk to me about what's really going on. I'm curious, like, what else you're getting in these these, like, insulation chamber convos. I want all the pillow talk. So if you guys are are at the at the water cooler, and you are talking about how much you either loved or hated me in my presentation, I wanna know. Yeah. If you're talking about how much this other person wowed you all in a presentation after I left, I wanna know. If I have a quiet dissenter, somebody who never really engages in the company meetings when we're sitting there in the discovery or analysis or demonstration we have, I I'm asking. I'm on I was in there, and Nick didn't seem to say much in the hour, hour and a half we were there. Is that just how Nick is, which is totally fine, or am I missing something? Then that gives me a little more intel. Maybe I have to do two meetings with Nick because Nick is quietly dissenting. But when they're in these meetings without me, he's like, nah. Not really feeling it. And he might have enough juice to stop it. Right? And so I'm getting anything I can from those people. I wanna know every single thing that's happening. And then I'll find out, say, hey. Here's my cell phone. So if something comes up, question, comment, concern, a one off, just shoot me a quick text about what you're thinking or what the team is saying. I'm happy to hop on another conversation or send some information in the silo directly addressing maybe what some of the team feedback is because oftentimes feedback is happening in real time. It's not happening during the meetings. Alright. If you have a systematic issue, you're not waiting, you know, until the meeting to talk about it. You're typically at your computers complaining about the system. Send it. One sentence. Just send it. Let's pretend that you find out that Nick is a dissenter in the deal. Everyone else, you're the vendor of choice, but this is the blocker in the deal, and Nick is all about team Pineapple Pay. What do you do to address the potential deal blocker? Yeah. So this is where I'll typically leverage that champion again and go, hey, Arman. From what I'm hearing, it sounds like everyone's really leaning our way, which is great. We've got a lot of things we can fix for the company in really short order, but it doesn't seem like Nick is quite there yet. So before I reach out to him, what are your thoughts about that? And I'll just leave it open. They might say, I didn't notice, or he's always like that or whatever, but I don't wanna lay any landmines there outside of I know that Nick isn't necessarily filling me yet. Yeah. Once I get some feedback, oh, he's just like that or he's just worried about this or that or he's worried about that, I'll ask, well, typically, when this happens and other decisions you all have made together, what's the best way to get Nick to engage a bit more? Takes more information. This goes back to my being coachable around where we are on the deal. Right? Once I get that feedback, I'm directly calling Nick. Hey. Am I gonna say, Nick, you haven't said anything in nine meetings, so I'm calling you just to figure out what's going on. Right? Yeah. I'm gonna be like, hey, Nick. I realized that we probably just spent enough time getting to the crux of what may be top of mind for you. Do you have a few minutes just to chat? Everybody always says yes because they're evaluating us. Right? You cannot talk to me at this point time. So then in that conversation, I'm like, hey, Nick. You know, I heard back from the rest of the team. They seem to be leaning our way, which is great. But I do wanna make sure that we touch on things that you might be thinking about, like, hey. Why is the automation working this way? Or, hey. And I'm using some of the same things my champion told me, rephrasing a bit so it's not one to one. I don't wanna necessarily burn the bridge there. But just throwing a few landmines, things I know he might be skeptical about, things that I don't think he's skeptical about, just to give him three or four items to choose from and then leave it. So walk me through what your apprehension is for leaning our way. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. I picture you, like, throwing these, like, scarves up in the air of some of their, like, frustrations or objections. You're soft floating them to be like, which one is Nick, this angry dissenter, going to grab and latch onto? And it's similar to the concept that we talk about in discovery of giving multiple choice questions. Because if you just sit down with Nick and you're like, so what are your apprehensions? He might clam up a little bit. But if you're like, hey. I'm curious. Like, where are you today? What's making you feel like this this might not be the right fit? I'm I'm curious about, like, some of the places you might have reservations. Is it a, b, or c as or integrations? Is it where we're priced right now? Is it, like, you've worked with somebody else in the past and had a good experience? I haven't sold what you have, so I'm just coming up with stuff. Yeah. They might bite on one, and they might get on the integrations one. And that now gives you room to explore and maybe overcome that objection if I'm understanding how you do it properly. Exactly. Right? And you have to be open to them saying, I just think your product sucks. And then I can say, okay. Well, compared to what? And now we can have a real conversation. Right? And so sometimes people are worried about asking for the feedback because they don't have an answer for certain things, and that's okay. But the idea is if you have some feedback that doesn't go in my favor, it's typically because you have something in your mind that you're comparing me to, either one of my competitors or past experience. And if I can get that, then we're in the game. Cam, I'm really worried about implementation, and we haven't talked about it yet, and it's just I don't wanna go through one. Okay. That's fair. Why? What happened Mhmm. Previously that makes you feel like an implementation with us is gonna be so much worse? And now we're in it. The time, the effort, the mistakes, the the the the the the the and now I can actually start having a real conversation with it. And then once I give my spiel around how we're not gonna be that way, then I go back and say, was that enough? Because I think sometimes when people do objection handling, we answer the question, but we never double check to see if we've it's sufficient. Because we're like, check that box, and Nick could be like, I'm not satisfied. I wanna I wanna reference call, or I wanna talk to somebody in our industry, or I want your transition team to come out and talk to us. Well, if you didn't ask a second question after you address the objection, then you might still have the same dissenting Nick, and you don't get the deal. And I think you have to be willing to open yourself up to, did I provide you with enough information for you to feel satisfied and go back into the room and say, hey. Me and Cam had a great chat. Definitely in their way now. What's next? Until I get him there, my job's not done. So let's pretend that you have all of your five one on ones. Some of them go well. Other times, you need to meet with Nick three or four times to flip him from, like, a red light to a yellow light. How do you wrap it all back together? So that's when I'm going back to the decision maker or the person with the most authority that we identified in the first step and saying, hey. Your team has been great. They've shown with me five, ten, twenty hours of time to figure out what's going on. Here's kind of a breakdown of everything that's happening. Have a dialogue around that. Some stuff they're gonna know about, some stuff they are not. And then when we talk about presenting this now to the final decision maker for demonstration and pricing and things like that, I'm making sure in that demonstration, I'm one to one calling out things that are directly bothering the team and connecting it back to a larger goal that my decision maker told me about. So now what it makes it feel like back to that pitchfork and torches thing is we're in a demonstration. There's 10 people in the room. I've got all my information from seven of them. I want them to know they were heard. Their information didn't go in a vacuum. So I can say something like, yeah. So we're gonna go through our, you know, applicant tracking and sourcing platform. So, Nick, you mentioned how it's taken you all three weeks for time to fill for a simple entry level nursing job. The reason is bop bop bop bop bop bop. And then I'm gonna talk about how we're gonna do in the sim. So I'm showing it as I'm giving Nick's story to the entire people in the room because typically those up top have no idea what's happening. So now it's this eye opening experience for everyone, and then your product looks so much better because it's latched to Nick's crappy story of how bad his process is today, and I'm showing you the future in real time. And then I'm going, Nick, I mean, you're the guy assuming that does this more often than not. Are we addressing some of those things? Walk me through how you're gonna see how our system not only alleviates the stress, but makes it so you can 10 nicks without having to find 10 more nicks to come in the company and help you out. And then I just leave it open and let Nick talk about how great we are. Powerful thing about what you're doing. I was talking about this with one of our new reps here, McKenna, this morning. When you're pitching, part of the reason we're doing all this freaking discovery I mean, dude, you're setting four follow-up meetings before the presentation. You're doing an immense amount of discovery. Part of the reason we are asking all of these questions and doing discovery is so that when it comes time to go give the demo or give the presentation, we can follow the format of what I heard, how we help. What I heard, how we help. What I heard, how we help. And that even if you have an in the box solution that cannot be customized or configured whatsoever, it makes it feel built for them. It makes it feel close to home, and it makes them think throughout the entire presentation, This is exactly what we need. And so if you're losing deals to things like people saying, oh, this might be more than what I need or it doesn't feel right for us, it's because you're not going what I heard, how we help again and again and again. And then you put a beautiful cherry on top of this juice slurpee cam where you're not at the end of a riff going, so, any questions? What you're doing is you're saying, how do you feel like this would help you? You're asking a question that invites conversation as opposed to a question that keeps you in the frame of a presentation. That is powerful how you're doing it. It's small, but it's powerful. Yeah. And then we're also connecting it to larger growth. So now Nick, the entry level employee, I can say, great, Nick. So this is actually gonna support you in growing the company 20 to 30%. So now I've tied this entry level employee into a business objective for the decision maker. Now Nick is valuable. He's not a cost center. Right? And what typically happens with people that are in entry level positions, they typically are seen or felt or can be felt as cost centers. Therefore, their input isn't that valid. But if I'm in a room with all the big dogs and I'm saying, Nick, now that you're gonna be able to use our system to its full capacity, number one, we don't have to hire 10 more Knicks, which is way too costly and way too time consuming. But number two, Nick, you're gonna have direct input in the company scaling 20 to 30%. Walk me through how you can see yourself doing it. Now everybody is looking at Nick as the guy, and he gets his five minutes of fame. And now you've won the deal. Because it's impossible at the end for the CEO to go, I don't get it. Yeah. You know what I mean? We've already connected the dots for him with his people with tangible examples. Now you don't have the I don't see the value of an of a recruiting system. Banger on an episode. Juicy episode. Yeah. Appreciate it. Running out of time. Gotta move to the final question, which is talk about a lot of best practices for sales people to follow. Now I need to flip that on its head and ask you about the inverse. So the final cue, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it's hurting them more than it helps? Probably the biggest one is asking the next question. And what I mean by that is to the example I gave earlier, you got a problem question. You got a how it's working for them current question, but you don't ask the question of whether you satisfied what they need. People are so worried about not having the neck next answer. And most of the time, if you don't have the answer to the third or fourth question, people respect it. And then you can go back and say, I'm not really sure if I can do that, Nick. But I will come back to you by tomorrow or next week when we sit back down and tell you either that we can do it or a a direct workaround that other all of our clients use. Right? And people are worried about having to tell their prospects no. We can't. Yeah. And so they don't ask. Phenomenal. Cam, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a three step recap and one thing you can do. Alright. Three step recap. Number one, you gotta find the shadow decision maker in the organization. One way you can do that is get everyone in the room. You'll ask them a normal discovery question, but the executive is always the one who answers the impact questions because they're the ones who can connect the dots. From there, step two is you need to incite the riot. You're gonna isolate one champion, and then you're gonna use your champion to schedule three, four, five one on one breakouts with each of the other stakeholders in the deal. That will make them far more likely to discuss things more openly and honestly with you when they're not in a big room where oftentimes the loudest voice will dominate the room or they're worried about the perceptions of other people. And then number three, when you bring the whole room together, that's your opportunity to connect the dots. And so what you're gonna do is you're gonna write down and you're gonna show and explain everything you learned and everything you heard, but you're also going to connect Nick's problem to Connor's problem to Jane's problem, and you're gonna show the interrelations between the problems from all of the one on one breakouts, and then you're gonna show them the after state. So what I didn't like and what I will like working with us. Alrighty, Nick. What's one thing people can do? So there's one other thing that Cam was doing in his presentations where once he finishes a riff of what I heard and how we help, he's asking a question that invites conversation to the person whose functional area is impacted by that. That is way more powerful than asking any questions. It's fine to ask your prospect if they have any questions at times in a sales cycle, but it's a dangerous question to ask when you're giving a presentation because that question keeps you in the frame of you giving a presentation because that's what every salesperson asks when they need to take a breath during presentation. Instead, what I recommend you do is think about some of the key moments in your presentation and literally write down, this is something our team is working on, script what are questions you could ask instead that invite conversation. And the magic thing is when you ask a question, like, so I guess I'm curious. Like, I've shown you how our ebill routing platform works. I guess, do you feel like this is gonna solve some of the delays that you've been dealing with? Or how do you feel like this is gonna impact your workflow today? When you ask a question like that, if they have questions, I promise you they will ask their questions. But more often than not, they will engage you in conversation. So the thing you can do is go preplan some of the questions that you can ask in that presentation. Now, Arman, this is where you ask people how they can help us out, and I will tell you, I mentioned at the beginning about my little Easter egg. If you counted the number of times that you heard us say juice on this episode, go on to LinkedIn, DM me the number. I want the word juice plus the number of times that we set it. And if you get it right, I will respond with a generous discount code for any of our 30 MPC courses. So tell me the number of times you heard Juice. We'll see you next week on a juicy episode of 30 MPC.
