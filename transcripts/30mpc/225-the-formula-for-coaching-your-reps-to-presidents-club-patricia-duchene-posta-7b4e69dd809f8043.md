## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Mark Casaglo. And today, holy smokes. It is who Mark calls Patty d, Patricia Duchene, the CRO over at Postal, and holy smokes, this was one to watch. Mark, why should people listen? Listen. I think Patty, of all the episodes we've done so far, we haven't done a ton, Arman, but I think this might be setting the bar very high. She has two things that I think are so actionable that literally after you listen to this podcast, I think you could start them and level up. They're just like a b c, do this real quick, make it happen. This is not a theoretical podcast. Podcast for people that wanna do stuff. Let's do it. And a three two one a b c. Let's ride. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, time line, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Alrighty, Patty. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Tip number one would be start at end of week fifteen minute stand ups. So keyword there, fifteen fifteen minutes, never longer, and it really shouldn't be much shorter. The idea here is that you get your entire team in a room, virtual or in person, depending on what your office policy is, and every single person on a Monday morning is going to call their shot. This includes things like activity metrics, calls they wanna make for the week, meeting set, how far they wanna progress certain deals. And, ideally, they're gonna include something along the lines of, like, I wanna get the decision maker at a b c company to commit to a call. It's called team accountability. So everybody makes their call. It goes into a public space, whether that's a Google Doc or some type of, like, work management software, and it's shared. On Friday morning, not Friday, the end of day. Friday morning, that exact same group comes together, and they're gonna meet for fifteen minutes, and they're gonna call where they are against those targets. And then they're gonna say what they're gonna do with the rest of their Friday to get to what they called on Monday. Creates team accountability. Creates hustle culture on a Friday, and it really gives, like, that end of week punch to your targets. Woah. Woah. Culture. I know. I was gonna say that trigger word right there. Alright. Let's roll into number two. Next one. So situation behavior impact framework. It's really helpful when doing call coaching deal review. So I'll give you an example. Let's say you're you're on a you're on a call with a sales rep, and maybe they do a great job managing introductions if you cut the lay of the land, but then they hit the prospect with a ten minute slide deck where they just talk at the prospect for a solid ten minutes. And you can see over the course of the call, like, lose the audience's attention. Afterwards, you get with that AE and you're like, hey. At the beginning of that call, so you put them back in the situation, you did a great job understanding who was who. You asked people why they were there. You asked what they wanted to get out of the call. But then you followed that with a ten minute slide deck presentation, and you didn't ask a single question. When you look at this call recording, you can see that you lost Susie Lou's attention around minute six. And we know, based off the questions you asked in the beginning, that she was the decision maker. That meant for the rest of the call, she was on her computer and she wasn't paying attention. What can we do differently next time? So you put them in the situation, you describe the behavior that you saw them exhibit, and then you explain the impact. This removes a lot of the emotion that sometimes comes with feedback, and it allows them to see why you're giving them the feedback that you are. Boom. The behavior is that was a great tip, Patty. And the impact is that I would like to hear your third tip before we start the interview. Alright. Third tip. Three by three by threes. So one of the parts about being in leadership that I don't feel like is talked about enough is that part of our responsibility is managing up. It's not just managing down. And this can be very challenging because oftentimes, we view our our leaders with very high regard, and we aren't sure really what we're supposed to do if they don't necessarily directly ask us for something. So something that I've gotten really accustomed to doing is every single Friday, I prepare my three by three by three. It is the three good things that happened this week across my org. It is three negative or down things that happened across my org, and then the three things that my org or I am going to do next week. And I deliver this every single Friday end of day. This means that I don't get phishing questions from my leadership. They know exactly what's going on. And if you can create an environment where you have leaders all submitting these or all sharing these amongst the leadership team, it creates an incredible amount of transparency between departments. Love it, Patty t. Let me ask you a quick question. I wanna go back to your second one, the situation behavior impact model. I think it's super super interesting. And I think that feedback is probably the most important thing that we do as leaders. Like, how else do people improve? How else do they know what's going on? When you're giving feedback, I think it's always a mystery of how does feedback get logged, tracked, and executed on over time. So given somebody feedback in the moment is semi useful, how do you how do you extend it past that one conversation so that a rep actually does it? Mhmm. Well, the hard part about feedback in general is that, like, it is often in in the moment, and we also don't make a ton of time for it. Unless you're on the call or you've made time to actually review a call with a rep, which for many sales leaders today, like, that's that's that they're really lucky if they have time to do that. It's hard. And so one of the things that I think is important to do is to really manage what you're working on with each individual rep. So core competencies should be reviewed on kind of, like, a monthly, depending on how big it is, could be quarterly basis. And really try, outside of little tweaks, to limit your feedback to one core area on a timeline. So let's let's keep month for the sake of this conversation. So let's say you're working with Susan. She's a sales rep. And in my example, she really struggles with how to kick off her demo. She feels like she's got to talk at. And so for the entire month, you are focusing on really the first fifteen minutes of her demo. How does she create engagement? And if you're able to just have one focus area, it's a part of every single one on one. And your one on ones need to be not just auditory, obviously. They should be logged and tracked and written somewhere, however your company wants to do it, but it should be public space. And it should be in every single deal review. It it could be brought up in your in your stand ups that we talked about at the beginning of the call. It's like Susie could say part of what she wants to do that week is she's like, I'm going to have two people answer questions during the first ten minutes of my demo. And if you can do this over a time period like a month, the next month you pick the next thing. It's like, hey. We're having a really hard time, Susie, asking for a next step at the end of your demo. And you're crushing the demos, but now it's like we're losing deals at this stage, and we can't get them on another call. We don't aren't setting expectations, on what needs to happen on both sides. And now that's what we're working on for the next month. You gotta remember, like, people can only take so much feedback at a single time. Yeah. They can only take so much feedback. And, also, I think the other thing is is they can only change so much at a time. So listen. I get all I get everything you're saying. Like, do little chunk, reinforce it all the time. We both know that, like, 80% of reps still aren't gonna do anything about it. Like, how are you switching it around and getting 80% to do something about it? Well, I think it's the impact piece. So there's a change management framework. Simon Sinek came out with the whole start with why, the golden circle. I'm sure you guys are familiar. By explaining the impact, you're giving them the why. And if they can create a positive impact on their target and their quota and their cash, they're more likely to make a change. It's the what it's in it for me component. That's the impact. One mistake that I used to make is I would write all of my notes as I was taking a call with a rep. And what I would do is I would just send them my notes after the call, and it had 20 points of feedback. And what I learned is I actually needed to take all of that, still take all of my notes, and then delete every bullet except for two that were time stamped to the specific moments? Because if I gave them 20, they would take nothing. How do you dose this in a way? Just ignore things that are going wrong in the calls, but you also don't overwhelm them. Every leader takes notes like that on a live on a call. I have a I have a framework. I have pluses and minuses, and it's just like rapid fire plus, minus, plus, plus, plus, minus. And so I have the good and the bad, and I carve out fifteen minutes after that call to organize it. Not just pluses and minuses, but themes. And it's only the theme that makes the biggest impact is is what I'm gonna deliver outside of a couple positives. Like, hey. You crushed that closing. But when it comes to actually behavioral change, I'm gonna focus on the theme that I think is gonna get them the furthest along. How do you use leaders to separate preference from best practice? How are you getting those, like, best practice things of this is how we're gonna do it because we know it's more effective versus I know that you'd like to give the agenda with bullet points, but I really like it when it's, like, numbered instead. I'm from sound really repetitive. It's the impact. Do bullet points versus numbers really matter? But, like, the impact is really all that matters. And I do think there's obviously some managers that are, like, still stuck in the way that it was taught, you know, thirty, forty years ago. Sales reps move and change when they can see that it's going to positively impact them. If there's nothing in it for them by changing, you know, bullet points in your exam they're not very likely to do it. But when you can prove to them and show them that maybe a different closing process is more effective, they're gonna do it. And you really just need one example. You need to work one time and for them to see it. And I'm sure there's someone on the team, more likely than not, that's already doing it. Take that person and put them on a pedestal and show them, like, hey. This is a killer demo. Make it a team team lunch and learn. Like, here are the points where they were exceptional. They did what we believe is best practice, which is most likely to get you to the next step in the deal and highlight that person. Everybody wants to be put on a pedestal in sales. So oftentimes, I find that when managers, leaders, what have you, are deconstructing calls, it's just a complete stream of consciousness throughout a thirty minute call that they're watching. It sounds like you're pretty particular around your pluses, your minuses, how you're sectioning the call, and how you're the call, and how you're synthesizing what's there. You mentioned a framework you have. Would you be comfortable walking through how you deconstruct a call? So the way I take notes, and then I'll go through what I do with them. So it's pluses and minuses, and I take them as the call transpires. Old school before there were things like the gongs and the kias of the world, I wrote them down or typed them out, and I tried to time stamp every couple of bullets so I knew roughly where I was at in the call. I then take them, and the first thing I do is I break it out, by basically intro presentation, if there is one. I call it more discovery. So you got intro, discovery, demo, and then you have closing. And so I'm gonna organize then my feedback, pluses and minuses, in those areas, and I'm gonna try to find common threads. So if there are themes, for example, talking at or the avoidance of questions, that could cross all of these. But I could also just see that, you know, I I have a ton of pluses in my intro discovery, and then my demo was just negatives. That is how I look at it. It's basically the course of a call like that. I'm gonna break it by its sections, and then I'm gonna look for cross section themes, if that makes sense. And then I'm gonna do the importance the importance analysis, which is actually the most important and what's gonna make the biggest impact. Is it a theme across all of them, or is it like we don't know how to demo in a way that's engaging or adaptive to our prospect? Super interesting. I love how you're breaking the call into the sum of its parts. So you have your intro, your discovery, your demo, your closing, but then you're not just, like, checklisting every single one of those. Again, you're trying to see what are the common trends across this entire call. And so I'm curious. Let's say you see some things that the team is struggling with in broad based or one rep is really nailing in a certain theme. You mentioned putting that rep on a pedestal and having them train the entire team on a demo tape review. I'm curious. How do you address some of the common themes that you're seeing across your reps in a team training environment? So I I do think the process of having a seller train the team is always best because it's kinda like, don't take it from me because you probably don't believe I've ever sold something. Take it from a rep. But I love having reps do trainings for a few reasons. One, obviously, they listen more. But two, I think for that individual contributor, it's incredibly empowering. You know? It's not every day that you get to lead your team in in an exercise. I take presentations very seriously. I think presenting or learning how to present even if in a small room is a very powerful skill set. But here's this this the tricky part is it can't just be a deck. Ideally, it's including snippets of calls that they've used this tactic or behavior really, really well so so they can back up what they're saying with evidence. And then, of course, you know, in in including some type of, like, participation. Like, hey. Let's actually go and try to apply it. I think that while it's super uncomfortable doing, like, impromptu cold calls in front of people is great. Everybody fails. And I learned how to sell sitting next to people and listening to other people fail, and we lose a lot of that. So creating environments where you can do a little bit of that more often, I think, is really impactful. How do you think about sample size, Patty? Because a manager can go in and coach a call or two, but, like, a rep has 20 calls a week, a 100 calls a month, like, and you're looking at four. No no manager has the time, I don't think, to go in and listen to 20 calls a week with a rep. Like, how are you solving for are we really nailing what's important for this rep or not? You're never gonna get to perfection. I think we have to get super comfortable with that in general. My cadence, two calls, two weeks. Because there's some weeks I can bang out two calls for a rep in one week, and there's other weeks where it's like, it's just not gonna happen this week. Mhmm. So two calls, two weeks. And depending on your sales process, if AEs are doing, you know, they're doing cold calls and they're doing discovery and they're doing demos, you wanna cover all parts of the sales process. So at least one of each, but you're never gonna know. You have to have faith, though, that, you know, if they don't know which call you're picking, you're gonna get you're gonna get a fair sample size over time. The other alternative, and it depends on your relationship with your team, is, like, you can ask them. I need you to send me a call you're proud of this week and a call you're not proud of. Depends on, you know, the the environment that you've created, but that's another way you can do it. It's tough right now. I I'm not talking to a single revenue leader I know that says every deal isn't hairy. We don't have the coverage that we want. You know, every everybody's just really, working hard right now. What are a couple of things in calls that you're seeing or hearing about that are just, like, things that leaders really need to pay attention to right now to make a difference? You need to be dead set that your buyer understands the approval process internally and has done it recently. Let's say past six months. Anyone who's bought something past six months ago does not know what it's gonna take to buy something now in every single company no matter the size. So you have to be super confident that your champion, your catalyst, whatever terminology you decide to use, has bought something and understands what it's gonna take to get something across the line. And if they don't, you start asking more questions. How do you figure out if your reps are asking those questions when you're probably overseeing, at times, hundreds of opportunities? If you're fortunate enough to have likes of the Gongs or the Kya's of the world leveraging keywords and looking for how many times, you know, they ask about the CFO. The CFO is involved in so many deals now. I'm sure I'm sure, Mark, you're probably seeing this as well. When was the last time the CFO necessarily cared about, you know, certain technology purpose purchases? But now it's like any dollar out, it matters. Yeah. So you can use technology like that. It's definitely challenging at scale for sure. Patty, I'm seeing, like, you sitting down. It's 03:30 on Friday afternoon. It's awesome in SLO. The the waves are calling. The winery Wineries want me to be there. Yes. Oh, yeah. You're about to sit down. I know your CEO, Eric. He's probably literally got some kind of automation thing that says if Patty doesn't send this to me by 5PM on Fridays, all over you. Right? So your sit down, how do you avoid recency bias and just put the stuff that's happened today or the the day before? Like, how are you actually getting a comprehensive, these are the three by three by three things without just doing it in your mind right then and there in the moment? So the first thing I do is actually pull up my calendar. Mhmm. Because I wanna remember every meeting that I had over the course of the week. Sometimes that'll jog my memory and be like, oh, yeah. We did meet with them on Tuesday. That's relevant. Because it absolutely can. It can be like, okay. Well, these are the three deals I was on this morning, so that's what I'm gonna talk to you about. Yeah. So I pull my calendar, and they also use our OKRs. So we're trying to be really, really thoughtful about our OKRs as a company, as an org, department level. And so I'll use both the calendar and the OKRs to decide what it is that I'm putting here. Because what Eric cares about is what we're doing to get to our OKRs. And so the things that I put here need to show that we are working towards those targets and those metrics. Are you, like, logging stuff throughout the week? Is it, like, a running email that you keep open in a draft thing, or are you literally just kinda going through the calendar and, like, summarizing it on on Friday? It's it's not super sophisticated, but I do use private Slack messages. And I'll just, like, send myself notes throughout the week, and then I'll look at that with the calendar and the OKRs. And it's like, okay. Well, this is what I've got. But I use I'm a big fan of Slack private messages. I have no idea if that's what it was intended for, but it keeps me totally sane. And it's like my running list of, oh, I should make sure that they know about this. My big thing with Eric is, like, when he's asking me a question, it should be thoughtful and it should be forward thinking, and it should never be like, did you do this or why didn't this happen? He should already know if it did or didn't happen. I used to do something similar when I was running the Pave Sales org with my CEO. And one thing that I struggled with is the altitude of the updates. In other words, should I be sharing macro insights or more micro insights? So a macro insight would be, hey. It looks like we're starting to lose deals for these types of reasons. We're seeing this in our win rates. Or overall, pipe gen is pacing behind where we would expect it to be. Right? Typically, like, referencing larger sets of data versus, hey. We have these two key deals in the crosshair, and I really need to get involved in these two. Are you doing both? Are you saving the more macro insights for a monthly or a less frequent update? How do you think about the different levels of an update that you're sending upward? So in the example of those two key deals, if those are 50%, I'm going to include it. But if they're too exciting logos but not that big when it comes to ARR, I wouldn't include it. When it comes to the macro stuff, I I never write a macro without backing it with data or examples. Hey. We're starting to lose deals because x competitor has a b c functionality, and and we don't. I know for a fact that is going to be copy and pasted and sent to product. So if I don't include examples, I'm just gonna get a grumpy slack from product. Examples, give them an opportunity to go in and dig for more information. How do you do this with sales managers that report into you? Are you having them do a similar type of update? What is the level of information, or what do you expect from the people that are reporting into you? For sales managers, expect it to be really tactical. Like, that's their bread and butter. That's what they live in is, like, it should be deals. Like, we've we feel like we're losing control of this deal. This is their opportunity, basically, to raise the orange or red flag. I expect it to be very much pipeline related. I don't expect them to come with any macro assessments. I want it to be very, very tactical. Where do you need assistance? Who on your team deserves a public shout out because they're just, like, crushing lead gen or they're crushing their close one ratios, whatever it may be. Let's say in your three by three, you start to identify some trends that are like, okay. Like, markets turn in. This is getting a little bit more challenging, and I'm expecting that this is gonna be a little bit harder than we thought it was gonna be on the onset. Right? I'm curious. When you start to identify some downward trends, right, how do you make it so that people aren't just prying into every single deal in your pipeline, but rather they're actually seeking to help the sales organization that might be going through a tougher time? If when you start to see trends, and we'll use the product example, where you're starting to lose deals because of x y z feature function, whatever, that doesn't exist, taking that to your head of product and saying, we have a problem. How are we going to fix it? And giving them the opportunity to say, like, hey. This is a positioning thing. And acknowledging that that you could have a positioning problem, which is very much in control of go to market. And ideating on, like, do you could are there changes to the way that we're pitching our product? Are there changes to the website that make it way more appetizing to the ICP that you're trying to address that maybe is finding this other tool to have more features and functions? But it needs to be a we thing. I was saying that I I completely stole from a mentor of mine who now works at our competitor. It's it's it's terrible mentor mentee relationship now, by the way. But it's assume positive intent. And so I made it very clear to our head of product. His name is Jeff. We have a good relationship. And I'm always like, assume positive intent anytime I come with you. Anytime I come bring something to you, assume positive intent. I fully will never point my finger at you, but I do expect you to be my teammate and help me solve. Some of the most dangerous moments that I had when I was a VP of sales was when these conversations hit the boardroom before they hit the one on one. So for example, I would send an update to my CEO, and all the alarms would be ringing. And it was like, as a seven person executive team, we're gonna talk about why we're losing deals in market, and we're gonna figure out if it's a product thing or a sales execution thing or a marketing thing in a seven person cage match, and everyone is ready to kill each other. And so I'm curious. When you have one of these situations, how can I manage these types of news better? And what is the right way to manage this with your fellow executives without all of a sudden ringing the alarms, and then every single executive is down each other's throats? So use your EQ. And if you feel that something you're gonna put, for example, in your three by three is going to cause your CEO to have an emergency meeting Monday morning to bring all the troops together to be like, how are we going to solve this? And it's going to put the spotlight on marketing or on product or another one of your peers. You're not going to put that in your three by three. You're instead gonna have a one on one with that department head. You're gonna say, hey. I have a fiduciary obligation to bring this to to to my CEO. We gotta tell him because we have a problem. You and I should come with a proposal on how we're gonna fix it before we do that. You gotta have some EQ. And the ones who don't are really the ones who fizzle out the fastest because you just end up burning a ton of bridges. So I think EQ, Patty, is one of those things that you hear conceptually. You don't really understand it until you kind of have experienced it. You have that first time where you're like, oh, I didn't do this when I thought it was, and actually got way better reaction or response or result or whatever. If you're talking to a young leader that's listening to this podcast and you're like, hey, here's a quick way to understand EQ or quick way to grab EQ, like, how how are you helping young leaders with that kind of stuff? I'm gonna go back to the situation behavior impact. Going back to impact, put yourself in your peers shoes or in that other person's shoes. What are they gonna think? How are they gonna feel when you say x y z? And if you're gonna put them in a position to be defensive, how can we augment your feedback, your advice, your statement so that instead, they would like to participate in the conversation? Because the worst thing you do is make someone defensive, and all they're doing is just guarding. They're guarding their decisions. They're guarding their team. Instead, it's be far more productive if it's engaging. And so having that conversation, I think, is really important. And I think that all new leaders have an experience where somebody's done it to them. Sure. And so you can almost use that situation behavior impact to explain, like, look. Remember when when so and so was was poking holes in your pipeline and didn't make you feel super great? Like, let's think about what could they have said that maybe would have encouraged you to actually open up your book of business and ask for help instead of just defending the decisions that you made. I always have this visualization in my head that, like, we're all on a boat and every exec or leader has an oar, And the minute you piss someone off, they drop their oar. They can't focus on rowing because they're so focused on defending. And so, like, how do you keep everyone rowing the boat and solving problems? Well, Patty, this has been absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, it's not forty minutes to president's club. It's thirty minutes to president's club, so we have to move to the final question. And the final question is, what is one thing that if every sales leader in the world stops doing it, every revenue team out there would get a little bit better. If every single sales leader would care more about their team's ability to execute and what their team has waiting for them after work than their ego and their image, seems to be a lot better off. Boom. Check it out the door, folks. And check out the Mark and Mondo recap coming up soon right after this one. Patty, thank you for joining the show. This was fantastic. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Mark. What'd you think? Well, I'm on listen. I think this three by three by three thing that Patty talks about super interesting. I think it creates a framework that might create enough separation between you and a CEO or a CRO or a VP, whoever you're kind of doing it up to, that lets you have a little bit more freedom, but also keeps them connected enough to what you're doing that they don't feel like you're out there, like, kinda just freestyle and everything. Yeah. One one of the things that I learned is if you get to the point where your CEO doesn't know what's going on and they start to ask you questions, you've already lost the battle. Your goal is to give them more information than they need earlier than they need it so that they almost assume that things are going well in the white space where you didn't give them an update. And I'm gonna be I'm gonna be honest, Armand. Like, I struggle with this area. I am too busy doing, and I don't spend enough time communicating what I'm doing. And then I'll get a question of how's this going? And somebody feels a little heated. I'm like, well, we've been doing that for three weeks, and this is what's happening. And they're like, why didn't I know? And I'm telling you, avoiding that kind of communication and relationship cycle is really, really important if you wanna have an effective relationship with, the person that you're managing up to. That's exactly right. Alrighty, folks. Well, if you enjoyed this one, go connect with Patty d on LinkedIn, and stay tuned for the next one. Cheers, folks.
