## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode. Not this episode, not this playbook, but rather this five minute product roadmap jam, courtesy of your two hosts. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Szygalski. And today, you guys know we try to drop some new stuff in the world of 30 MPC from time to time, but what we also try to do is we try to let you know it's coming before we drop it so that you know it's structured, you know it's intentional, you know it's crispy. And guess what? We have a huge announcement today that unfortunately, we're actually going to be permanently banning webinars at 30 MPC, sort of. But before I get into that, Nick, what are we gonna cover today? So if you joined us in the 2022, you may have seen that we launched our thirty minutes to presidents club live series where every month we put on a webinar, which is gonna be a band word. We'll talk about that. But we had a lot of people join. They were a lot of fun. We talked about best practices for cold calling and discovery, etcetera. We also set up a monthly summary of our best tactics, tips, and takeaways from the podcast, and we put that together in the form of a newsletter, which many of you have signed up for. Thank you for that. And then finally, believe it or not, Armand, I don't know if you can count, we actually recently hit episode 100, which means I personally have recorded with you 99 times more than any sane human being should ever do. Now that brings me to what would a sane human being do for the second half of twenty twenty two if he was running thirty minutes to president's club? Well, thank you, Nick, because I certainly can't count a 100 episodes. And so I'm glad you led me right into the second half because I can't even count to two. So here's what we're doing, folks, is Nick and I were having a couple of Mai Tais on the beach, and we were reminiscing. And we looked at the podcast, and we were like, the podcast is different. Most sales podcasts are an hour of just wandering conversation where you have to spend 90 minutes listening just to get one tactic, if that. And then we cut that thing in half. We hyper edited it. We structured the front and the back, and we made it the most tactical sales podcast in the world. And then we launched webinars or webbies as I like to call them. And number one, I just hate the word webinars. It's a little bit too corporate. But number two, most webinars are sixty minutes where four people show up and they basically talk at you and they answer the occasional question. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's fun. And they talk about some topic. Unfortunately, when we made this thirty minutes, it was an improvement, and the audience still liked it. It was still tactical, but, honestly, it didn't have the same editing and the production value that the podcast had. And it it just felt like a less edited podcast and a show up and throw up kinda panel thing. And we don't owe you guys good. We owe you all great. And so moving forward, we will never do another webinar again. Instead, we are only doing live tactic tear downs. And what that means is every quote unquote webinar moving forward is going to be breaking down a real tactic, a real tactic. That might be live cold email reviews that you have to see live on a webinar. That might be a live cold call review that you send in and we review your cold calls live. That might be a live calendar tear down where we go through Nick's calendar, and you have to be looking at him. And we're pulling in the audience asking, where is Nick wasting his time? Because he's sleeping until 11AM and then starting yoga at 1PM, and then he starts work at 4PM. How could he possibly run his day like that? And these are things that you have to see. You have to hear live, and we want to interact with you all live. And again, it will only be thirty minutes, and it will only be real tactics. And so how do you know what's to come? Well, guess what? Number one, for q three, those are actually the next three. Cold email reviews with Charlie Johnson, cold call reviews, and then calendar tear down. Those are your July, August, September new live tactic tear downs. And then if you're on the newsletter, every quarter, we're gonna tell you what next quarter's live tactic tear downs are gonna be. And then you can get into a rhythm where every quarter, you jump on with your team and you do the live cold call reviews. Alrighty, Nick. So that's what we're doing with the death to webinars. Tell me what's happening with the other parts of 30 MPC. Alright. But wait. There's more. So we wanna give you all an opportunity to literally steal our best stuff. When you listen to the podcast, you hear us talk about stuff like messaging frameworks and, oh, here's how you write a good cold email, but we wanna make it even easier for you. So if you've ever thought, wow, it would be really helpful to have Arman's joint execution plan outline to get cold email templates from us, to get messaging frameworks from us that you can actually apply to how you position the thing that you sell, we are launching a thirty minutes to presidents club toolkit. Now you can get access to that toolkit at the thirty minutes to presidents club website, which is thirty m p c dot com. There's also a link in the show notes. But if you wanna steal, like, our best templates and written things, go. Take them. We've got battle cards. We've got outlines. There's some really good stuff that you can use, steal, and write today. Alrighty, folks. And so those are your two things. You've got your live tactic tear downs, and you've got your tactical toolkit. And, Nick, how can people help us out here? Go to 30mpc.com. Grab some stuff. Steal some stuff. Uplevel your sales career. Make yourself some money. Maybe you'll even send me a Venmo so I can buy the guac at Chipotle. And join us next week on Pretty News the President's Club.
