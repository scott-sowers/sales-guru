## Transcript

There are three questions that you're gonna ask at the end of every single call, and the last one talks about setting next steps. A lot of times, there's this conventional advice in sales that you should always be setting a next step. That's actually a really common mistake because if you finish discovery call and your prospect literally doesn't care about the problem you're solving, a lot of times they will still agree to a demo because they wanna go window shopping. So the way that I'm gonna end these calls is with what we call the five minute drill. The first question is, do you wanna buy? Now when you ask this, you're not literally gonna say, hey. Do you wanna buy? What you wanna do is you wanna say something like this. Hey, Nick. Honestly, like, I I think there's something here. You mentioned that your employees were really, like, not understanding how their stock options worked. You mentioned that you've had a couple of employees leave for higher salaries even though they had a bunch of equity on the table. And I think these are problems worth solving. Honestly, between you and I, it's gonna take a lot of resources for us to keep going through all these demos, a proof of concept, all this stuff. Is that a problem that you actually feel like is something that your team would realistically invest in, and is it worth spending more time together, or is this a little bit of, like, a nice to have? You really wanna push them to check off the exit criteria of problem agreement in the stage. Once they say yes, then I can move to the next question, which is when do you wanna buy? In order to know what next step I need to set, I need to understand what is important in terms of when they need to go live. And so I might say, look. It sounds like you're gonna do a big comp cycle in q two, and it's q one now. And that probably means directionally, we wanna have this thing, like, contract signed and, like, starting to implement around February so you can go live in April. Does that directionally sound like the right timing for this kind of thing? Awesome. So what I'm doing is I'm directionally setting go live and contract sign date, but I'm not giving a formal formal walk back plan yet. That will happen on future calls. And then the final question is, how do you buy? And that ends in a period. It's not actually a question. The key with this one is you always want to suggest next steps because you've sold your software or your product a million times more than they have bought your product. And so here's what that might sound like. Well, awesome. Look. Sounds like we're directionally aligned that, like, this is a problem that's worth solving. Usually, the next step from here is we would wanna make sure that you feel like we're the best equipped to solve that problem, AKA solution agreement. And the way we would accomplish that is we would go through a sixty minute deep dive demo with you and probably one of your other peers, maybe your director of compensation over there at EMEA. From there, if that goes well, we would do the same thing, and we would bring that proposal up to Jane, your chief people officer. Does that sound about right? And so what I'm doing is I'm saying, here's how people have usually bought in the past. Here's the next step and what we're trying to get in the next step, the exit criteria. And then here's the next next step. What are we gonna do two calls from now to get the stage three exit criteria?
