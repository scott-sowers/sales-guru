## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Froeck. I'm here with my cohost, Mark Cosmo. And today, it's a round three, but a round one on the leadership show for the one and only Miles Kane. He's led teams at Drift. He's the VP of sales over at Tenderly, and, oh, man, this is a good one, especially if you like early stage selling. Mark, why should people listen? Mondo, huge get on this one. I've never met Miles, and I'm gonna just say this is I typically keep an eye on the timer for the podcast. Like, how many minutes are we in? How many are left to go? This guy got me so lost in the conversation. I didn't even look until, like, minute twenty seven, man. If you wanna get lost for half an hour, this is a place to get lost, brother. Alrighty, folks. You hear that? And a three, two, one, get lost. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Miles. Welcome back to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. So the first one, go beyond the quota. Each year, I want you to sit down with your reps and actually have them document one big hairy goal that they are working on outside of their work, not just hitting their quota, not just making their dials to not make their boss mad at them. What we want is something like maybe they wanna pay off their student debt. Maybe they wanna help their parents retire, buy their first house, kids moving to college, whatever it might be. If we write that down on paper, I found time and time again, it ties your day to day effort into the broader picture of why we're all doing these jobs. You find more motivated reps. They see that bigger picture, and, ultimately, they become more successful. Boom. What's number two? Number two, we're talking a lot about this concept of building a high performing and trusting culture in a digital first environment. And it's a tip that I've learned this years ago, and I find it over and over again. It's very simple but hard to do. The concept is praise in public and give direct feedback in private, especially in a digital first world where everybody lives in Slack, all the conversations in an asynchronous way. What we wanna do is lean into Slack for things like public shout outs, good learning, celebrating your wins, whatever it might be. If and when you have to move to more direct feedback and criticism of your reps, move it to a DM. Pick up the phone and call them. Ideally, jump on a Zoom. If you can get in person, even better. But the idea is praise in public, move that direct feedback into private. You will build a much more trusting and high performing organization. You know, I was gonna Slack you my feedback, but I need to do this in public, Miles. That was a great tip. What's number three? And the third one, I titled this create the magnet for recruiting. If you move from a seller into sales leadership, you may feel as though pipeline is no longer something you're directly responsible for, that it couldn't be farther from the truth. Yes. You have your sales reps. You have your deals. You have that pipeline you're managing. You also have a pipeline coverage you need to hit on the recruiting side. Whether you're looking to hire two people this year or 20, you should be consistently out there online and in person, talking passively as well as actively networking with top sellers in your network so that if and when you do have those new reps to open up, you have a consistent, high quality talent tool of people that you can talk to and engage with them. The goal is, on a quarterly basis, find a way to stay top of mind to every top seller in your network. Your future pipeline and your deals will say thank you in the end. Miles, not all sales leaders are created equally, and not all stages of growth in a company are equal. One thing we talked about before we jumped on the podcast was finding your niche. You as a sales leader need to match up with the niche of the company and where it's at. Talk Talk to me a little bit about that because that's saying no to some stuff that might be lucrative or fun or interesting, but maybe not for you. Yeah. It's something I've thought about a lot over the course of my career, and it's definitely changed drastically over the last couple of years as I've had couple of cycles under me of different companies and going through some acquisitions. When I first started as a seller, I had this big dream of getting it early stage at a company, taking it from single digit million revenue up into the hundreds or billions of revenue and ringing the bell and IPO, and all of a sudden you're there forever. You're the greatest sales leader in history. The reality is that's just not real life, and that's okay. I think the goal is through the process of being in a high growth company, you're gonna naturally gravitate towards the parts of the business that you are most successful and just dang excited about. For me, I've realized over the last couple of years, my superpower or skill set is helping technical founders who they've gone to market. They've got single digit millions of revenue, and they're trying to scale it. I can get it to probably, like, $50.60, 70,000,000 now in revenue. I've done it a couple of times successfully. Beyond that, I don't have that skill set or interest, and I'm okay with that. And a couple of years ago, I would have said, oh, no. I can do it. I can get up to a couple 100,000,000 and run a team of three, four, 500 people and be on a jet nine months out of the year. It's not for me. It's I'm not good at it. I don't have an interest in that. So I think the lesson or the learning there is proactively talking to your team, your fellow sellers, your fellow sales leaders, and just ask them the question of, like, what part of the journey really gets you most jazzed up so you can really double down on that? And, oh, by the way, take those learnings and then eventually take it to a new company. Flip it. Run it again. Like, we're all in this hopefully for the long game. We wanna be doing this for multiple companies for decades to come. Like, really get real specific and clear about your skill set. What gets you out of bed in the morning? What gets you excited? The end of the day, it's a job, but, like, let's have some fun doing it. There's something difficult about saying, I don't wanna run a huge sales org. Because that's like, let's get to it, man. It's all about the ego and, like, look at how many people report to me. And, you know, the more people that report to you, the more money that you make. And maybe you don't have as much upside in the other ones, but you're just bringing the cash bell all the time. How did you get okay with it? Like, how did you personally come to grips with, like, my spot is a few million to 50,000,000. That's what I love. That's what I like. If you were to talk to a friend, like, here's two or three things to think about to help you figure that out. What advice would you give? I think there's kinda two key things to think about or that I've thought about over the last couple of years. Earlier stage to me equals you're in deals, you're in the creativity stage. But as you grow and as you get to 10 to 20 to 30 closer to that 50,000,000, to me, at least in my experience, you lose a little bit of that need for the creativity, the need for the strategy, the need to jump on and fly to New York at the drop of a hat to go meet with a customer because you said you're gonna be in town, quote, unquote, that next week. You become more of the operations person. Right? You're tweaking the dials. You're now going from, okay. How do we get this thing from $3,040,000,000 to $2,200,000,000? Like, those are much different skill sets and much different strategic bets that you have to make. There's lots more hiring and firing and HR meetings and all the other internal things that we could talk about. But for me, it just I realized that it's more the creative aspect of early stage of getting to the scale versus taking the scale and then getting it two to three x from there. That's just what I get super excited and jazzed about, and I find my passion resonates with those founders who are trying to bring things to market and get to that initial scale. And so like I said, just a fun unlock to finally get to. You know, it took me fifteen years, but here I am. And so excited to have that. What's cool is all three of us have been part of that really early stage thing. So it was me at Pave. Miles, I know you're early at Drift. March, you're early at Outreach. And I remember I was hiring my first sales managers, and there were certain tells in the interview process where I was like, okay. What are the different things that you're gonna look for to diagnose your rep success and all that stuff? And I knew I was talking to the wrong person in the early stages when he's like, I'm gonna look at conversion by sales stage and all the different funnel metrics and all that stuff. And I'm like, dude, we've closed, like, 15 deals. I was like, we don't even have an MQL or anything like that. And so there's a different set of skills. I understand what the early stage sales environment feels like in deals, finding your ICP, oftentimes working with product to find product market fit, frankly. So what are the things that you're looking for? If you were advising a founder, what should a founder look for in an early stage sales leader versus a late stage sales leader? One of the first questions I love to ask is walk me through the first thirty days on the job. Say you start tomorrow, what would you do? And there's not a perfect answer per se, but there's certainly wrong answers. If they don't mention, I'm gonna talk to 10 to 15 to 20 as many human customers as I possibly can, not a good fit. Like you said, you don't necessarily have the complete product market fit nailed there where you're just trying to go from three to 300 reps. You're trying to get from initial interest that you have of the friends and family that might have taken a bet on you into something that is actually repeatable. To me, the only way I found success in doing that is talking to customers over and over again because they're the ones that have the answers. They're the ones that have the problems. They're the ones that you're driving efficiencies or productivity gains with your new technology. They're gonna give you those answers. So if a sales leader or a seller for that matter, if they don't immediately say that I'm gonna jump on whether it's live in person, Gong, Zoom, you name it, as many customer calls as possible in those first thirty days, to me, that's a red flag I'm touching on the person. So talking to customers, you know, I was really lucky at Catalyst. I talked to a 100 customers my first fifty days and felt like I understood the business infinitely better. What are two or three other things that a sales leader that specializes in five to 50 that should really make sure that they're doing all the time to deliver the results for their sales team? I think if you're at the 5,000,000, you probably have a handful of reps as well. The goal there to me is the consistent enablement and education and upskilling with that existing team so that you can take those top two to three sellers that you have and really tease out as much as possible from those brains into the next five to 10 to 20 reps as well. And so, like, the more that we can take from those two to 3%, the top sellers that are out there, they understand the product, they understand the market, they can just close these deals in their sleep. To me, it's getting that on paper and scaling it. What I found the best way to doing that is on the weekly sales meetings, like, actually interviewing those top reps and doing the deal wins, deal reviews, like, how did those deals come to fruition, where did they source them from, what was the differentiator. And just as importantly, I think, from the top wins and the top sellers, also deconstructing the closed lost deals on a consistent basis, understanding, was it value prop that we missed on? Was it product functionality? Was it a sales process? Is there a way to win them back in six to nine months' time? Things like that. So continuing to invest there, I think, is critical. How do you think about when you start to invest in resources like enablement, rev ops, things like that between 0 and 50,000,000 ARR? I thought a lot about this when I joined my current company, Tenderloin. I was fortunate that my CEO was bought into this. It wasn't my first hire, but second hire was our rev ops manager, and it was the earliest I've ever seen it come on in my career, and it's paid off in spades. Because I realized your job as that first sales leader, to me, it's like doubling down where your strengths are as well as seeking out the gaps or the weaknesses that you have and getting help there as quick as possible. Enablement to me is a bit more of, like, that's on you as a sales leader, and it's still on me right now in my current role where I'm still learning from our customers, learning from our market. I'm kinda building that story, and I think that's kinda phase two of we will eventually bring on a person and team to own that. But let's call that maybe the, like, closer to, like, the 5 to 10,000,000 range, and you really need to scale it. You're doing more hiring, onboarding classes, trainings, things like that. I'm telling you, I think that there's an episode we need to do on rev ops. Rev ops is the unlock for a sales leader. It takes so much off your plate. Rev ops is like the secret weapon of the best sales leaders. They just mash the gas pedal. I have a first time VP that I'm mentoring right now. And you know what our number one complaint is? I spend four hours a day trying to fix syncs between certain applications in Salesforce. She's like, I'm just doing ops work all the time. And, you know, her CEO won't let her invest in rev ops, and it is holding that company back. We hired rev ops similarly, third person on the sales team. You'll get a lot of this conventional early stage sales advice that comes from people that haven't done it in a long time or have never done it at all, where it's 10 to one ratio when you hire rev ops. You get 10 people on your sales team. And I'm like, the amount of nonsense that your team has to put up with, you have to upload your entire TAM. You need to make a salesperson do that. You get all these data integrity issues. You're trying to install, like, Outreach or SalesLoft inside of Salesforce, get all the stuff to work together. And by the time a rev ops person steps in, they're stepping into a complete rat's nest, and your team has spent equal time trying to find product market fit as they have been doing data entry and actually selling deals. And so, Miles, I love the concept of hiring. Yeah. My guy, Dave Gerhardt, was our first marketer at Drift and has gone on to building exit five. He is passionate about the concept of only work for a CEO who gets marketing. It's easy to say, oh, every CEO gets sales or, of course, they wanna grow revenue, but they don't necessarily know what that actually means. And I would say, like, a good just, like, tip on the fly thinking about that. If as much as possible you could control during the interview process with a early stage founder, especially if it's maybe a first time technical founder, actually walking them through what your expectations will be as you get on board. It's not that you need the budget to go hire 10 to 15 reps. Of course, you don't. But this is a very key sticking point that I did have the conversation with our founders before I joined my current company of understanding that investment of, like, what's it gonna take to stand up a CRM and get all of our data under one roof and actually have a central source of truth? I had buy in going into it, thankfully, and it took me a couple of times to get there, but I think it's a key critical piece to think about so that it's not just, okay. Great. I got the job. I got hired. And then you turn to your founder and say, this is what I gotta go do and hire. And they're gonna say, woah. What do you mean? Like, I thought that's your job. So, like, the alignment piece before you jump, if you can control that, super critical. Listen. I can't tell you how many times I've heard people tell me, well, just recreate your best rep. I can't tell you how many times I sold at Outreach. Outreach helps you recreate your best rep until I realized that's not really what it does. Right? But I bet there's a few mistakes that you commonly see people make in doing this, Miles, or mistakes that you've made. Like, help me understand, like, how do you not recreate your best rep when you're trying to? I think the number one that I've seen over and over again, and I've definitely been guilty of this, is thinking that Tom, who's the first rep with x y z personality, taking that personality and trying to push that across the entire team. You're gonna have some people who are loud and kinda braggadocious and in your face and very enthusiastic sellers. You're also gonna have some much more quiet, introverted, technical type folks, and that's just their personality. And so, like, just because the person who's louder and they're closing deals, it doesn't mean that that personality is what has to go across the entire org. It's, like, letting your reps have that freedom of letting their personality shine through and being okay with that. That's one thing that I think people get tripped up on a lot where they think they have to have everybody with the same script and talk in the same way and at the same tempo and pace and everything. I I don't agree with that. Yeah. Confusing personality with skill set is a real danger zone. Right? Like, you want certain skills, but how those skills are delivered can vary between people greatly. You just need them to execute the skill. Right? Yeah. I'll give you one quick example of that, which I I still laugh about this to this day. One of the guys at Drift with me in the early days, you know, Drift was marketing and chat bots, and it was the heyday of 2018 and '19 when things were crazy. We were very much a strong brand company. We were texting with all of our DMs, and there was a split in amongst the early sellers of whether or not to use emojis when you're talking to your buyers or not. I, for whatever reason, come from the emoji camp. I love the prayer hand emoji or any of those other ones. It's just my personality. Guess what? Couple of the best sellers at Drift never use an emoji once in any conversation ever with the buyer. It was just like a small thing about personality. We give each other a hard time about it, but, like, lean into your strengths of your personality. If you're a bit more buttoned up, great. That doesn't mean you can't continue to drive those deals over and over again. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Emojis and exclamation points are the skill set of true sellers, Miles. I'm with you. I'm with you. I know there are some elements around finding your own style and not trying to get people to copy certain things word for word. But I remember you know, I have a good friend who does a lot of early stage recruiting and hiring, And reps five through 15 oftentimes have a really hard time at these early stage organizations because they don't see all those early stage product stories. They don't see all of the deals that have been lost on the way to finding product market fit. And so then they walk into an organization that's not fully mature, and they see a deal that in a $30,000,000 ARR organization or a $100,000,000 ARR organization, that should close, and it blows up in their face. And so in the early stages, oftentimes you're figuring out, oh, if it's like this kind of international deal, don't even touch it. If it's like not growing quickly, don't touch these types of deals. If it's this kind of curve ball, you gotta hit it over this way. How do you document all of those early stage learnings and make sure that reps five through 15 aren't learning all of those things all over again? Well, I think you hit on it right at the very end with the keyword is document. Like so many startups, they're moving so fast, and it's all up here in the head, and they blink and two to three years go by. And they get to, like, the 5,000,000 revenue number, and they don't have anything documented for that scale. So the quicker that you can document these learnings, the better. Quick example. When I joined Tenderly a year and a half ago, we had maybe, like, 50 paying customers, and one of our founders was doing the founder led sales. And I came in to obviously take him out of that seat, and I needed to learn as quick as possible. In the first week, I sat down with them. We didn't even have a CRM at the time. We just had a spreadsheet of all of our paying customers, and we painstakingly went one by one through each one of those deals. And I just asked them a quick question of why did they buy? Tell me about the cycle. And I have two sentences for every one of those first 50 deals and so that any new rep can go in, and it's part of the onboarding now of not only internal sellers that come on board, but but anybody in the company can read that, and they're expected to in their onboarding to understand, like, what is this initial product market fit do we have? And, oh, by the way, which ones are best fit customers, which ones are just kind of friends and family, which ones are churn risk, and so on and so on. Like, if you don't document it, you're gonna create that just mess of trying to, like, pass it through, you know, the classic telephone game, and that just never works. So the document, put it in the internal Wiki, create that culture of writing things down on a consistent basis. I always say process makes you great, documentation makes you legendary, and I'm big on the document train. But I think that it's very difficult to get reps and leaders to buy in and to do it. How have you helped people understand the importance of it, Miles? Because there's gotta be a WIFM. What's in it for me? Right? Yeah. I think it goes back to the tip I shared about the concept of going beyond the quota. One of the things I've tried my best to is with any reps or anybody on my team is really invest the time early on as well as ongoing of getting to know them outside of their day job. What makes them tick? Are they having kids? Are they trying to retire young? Are they trying to buy the new house? Are they trying to pay off their student loans? Let's face it. Everybody in sales, for the most part, is money motivated. They understand the concept of financial freedom and creating leverage to create time and everything else there. In order to do that, we then have to work our butts off in our job. And so if we can start with the external piece of what are the bigger goals outside of our jobs, what are we looking to do in the next three, five, ten years, all of a sudden, once you get to that point, then you can narrow down on the, like, there's a reason why you're asking to document the wins. There's a reason why you're asking to have x amount of calls and pipeline there. Like, it ties to that broader picture and story. If you don't have that, to me, you're just that micromanager knocking on the door saying, hey. Have you made all your calls, or when's this deal gonna close? Like, none of that matters if you don't have the bigger picture written down each rep and consistently update it because life happens. Things change. Like, two of the guys on my team, they just had their second kid in the last six months. Their lives are completely different than they were six months ago. Right? Like, understanding what that means and now where their motivations are. Tell you what, they're both extremely motivated to come back and sell a lot of product. So I just talked to a rep who vented for me for at least fifteen minutes about the end of month, end of quarter culture of what's going on with this deal? When is it getting signed? Why haven't you got it in yet? Oh, it pushed. Well, how soon is it coming in? And those type of questions that are important in a way, but also very tone deaf. Right? So, like, I love this just concept of, like, you gotta dig into the person. And once there's a relationship, the information flows. But prior to that, you jabbing questions about stuff is typically viewed very negatively, probably much more negatively than you think it is by your reps. Yeah. I think one of the other key points of learning for an early sales leader, but even if you've been in the game for a while, a good reminder of there are two selling motions that you have. Your primary job, of course, is to help enable your team to get out there and close deals and scale and make your customers happier. But equally as important is the selling internally. And in order to sell internally, you have to come with data, and you have to be able to inform your internal stakeholders, typically, the rest of your leadership team, your CEO, your head of finance, whoever it might be, on the state of the business. So that ability to sell internally, that's a part that I think sellers in a vacuum and especially in a digital first environment, they don't see those conversations happening very often. Being as transparent as you can with your team to understand what you're doing when you're not talking to them about their deals or coaching them or enabling them, it helps them build a bigger picture of you as a sales leader. You're really running this business, and you have to not only enable your team, but you also have to internally keep your key stakeholders up to date on the health of the business and where it's gonna be because that all informs how successful you can be on the sales side. So, Miles, can we talk about the introduction of some metrics? So let's talk about the ones inside of the sales organization first, and then we'll talk about the ones with, like, product and stuff like that afterwards. When do you introduce some metrics and what metrics do you find are oftentimes most important to start with as a revenue leader? I mean, I think, like, even in the early days, you wanna have metrics be included as early as possible because to me, it gives you an indication of your best chances of success. And so I'm not the biggest proponent of 100% sales map piece of you absolutely have to make x amount of calls and do these amount of emails and these amount of LinkedIn called DMs because I just don't think humans are programmed to work that way in sales, and I just haven't seen it be super successful, especially in more of an upmarket mid to enterprise level deal. But at the same time, once you do get to call it the, like, I would even say, like, 3 to 4,000,000 in ARR, you start to have the leading indicators of how many conversations do you need to have with a prospect to turn it into an evaluation, how long does it take to move an evaluation through to close one, how many of those deals are you winning and losing on your average selling price. Once you start to get those to, core basics, now you can go to your team. And, like, to me, early on, the importance of introducing the metrics is it starts to shine the light on, like, which part of the funnel are you good at, which part of the funnel are you maybe having a blocker at and you need to really double down on. And so, ultimately, if you can introduce them as early as possible and continue to explain, especially to your team, the why behind it and that metrics actually are a leading cause of helping them be successful, it's a big step in the right direction. Early on, what I found was most helpful is I was still in the activity tracking because I was like, alright. You need this many opportunities, this many meetings, yada yada yada. And that stuff happened really, really early on. So we knew how to make pipeline, and we knew how much pipeline we needed to make. And those were two metrics that we tracked upfront. Leading indicators on pipe gen, how much pipe gen we had, and, obviously, the inverse of that is win rates. How much pipeline did you need to have based on a certain win rate to get your revenue? But then as you start to get more sophisticated, you start to track where that pipeline falls off because you're not on top of every single deal. You track the conversion from stage one to two, stage two to three, stage three to four. I'm curious. When do you start to get more programmatic around market feedback back to product or CS or whoever it is, for example. Because at the beginning, it's just like, dude, build what I tell you to build. Just build it. Trust me. Everyone's asking for it. And then eventually, like, three reps say one thing, two reps say another thing, and oftentimes market feedback is conflicting against each other. So how do you deal with that whole situation? I think the metric that I'm currently tracking now that is helpful in that regard is sales cycle length from qualified opportunity through to close won. I think early stage companies, especially, like, it's one thing to think that you have product market fit in the sense that you're talking to lots of customers and you got leads, and that's all well and good. The question that I have and what we're a lot of companies I see are struggling with is that initial conversation you have, it's in your ICP. It's a qualified buyer. They're gonna spin up some sort of evaluation, whether it's a free trial, paid pilot, whatever it is. What is that time to value from initial engagement through to them saying, yep. You guys check the boxes. We're gonna move you into procurement, or we're gonna swipe the credit card and get started. Once you have that date, let's just call it, say, it's thirty days. To me, my goal is what are the incremental pieces we can move the dial on to shorten that sales cycle length? Because the quicker the deals go from initial conversation to close one, the more healthy the pipeline is. The more people you're getting in there, you're getting to that point of thinking that scale is really near. And that will also help the internal conversations, I think, of going to those product folks and saying, hey. If we build x y z feature, we can see that it's gonna shorten our sales cycle by one to two weeks or two to three months, whatever it is. And you've got the data to show it if you've adopted a metrics first mindset and adopting things like, you know, your call intelligence or, you know, recorders that you can surface that up and show not only anecdotal feedback of customers asking for x y z features or just at an aggregate level on a weekly, monthly, quarterly basis documenting those close won and close lost deals. You're trying to surface up more and more of that to help your cause. But I would say, like, that's to me is, like, the the number one metric that is helpful at the stage of trying to get from early stage to growth is, like, what's that sales cycle length and what can you do not only on the sales team but also to your point on the product team or marketing team? Like, what are the gaps? What can we do as a team to accelerate those deals to closure? Miles, before we get to our final standard question that we ask at the end of the podcast, I've heard you say one phrase several times that has me curious how you got there. I've heard you say, and I'm not interested in it several times. And I think that that is a very brave thing to say as a sales leader. Like, you know what? I'm good enough at ops, but no interested in getting super great at it. You know? How do you get to that level of confidence as a sales leader? And, like, what kinda led you to be able to say, like, I'm just not interested in that, and I can hire other people or do other things to get there. But, like, you don't gotta be the best, the smartest at everything. Right? How did you get to, like, hey. Listen. I'm not interested in that. There's probably multiple threads I could pull on there, but, like, the immediate response in my head as you're asking the question is probably my like, I was a basketball player growing up. Basketball is still my game. I almost hate the sports cliche of, like, oh, you gotta go hire former athletes. They're the best sellers. Maybe, maybe not. We can argue about that till the cows come home. But the thing I will say about my sports background was the concept of a team sport. Like, you can be the best player out there, but if you're one player and the four other guys on the court with you are mediocre, you're not gonna go that far. And so having that kinda DNA just entrenched in my brain early on, like, you have to learn to give it away because it's the only way you can actually get to scale. And so being comfortable with that and also being comfortable that you're going out to hire the right people for the job, and you're not hiring those people to tell them what to do. You're hiring them to put them in seed and have them go. And let's see how much we can scale this. So it's not easy, but having that freeing sense of, if you wanna go far, do it with the team. Like, it's the only way I've ever seen success. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Unfortunately, we have to wrap for a final question, and it's the same one that you've answered two times on the sales show, but this one is about sales leaders. And so we've talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit, and we now need to talk about one to break. So if there were one bad habit that every sales leader in the world should stop doing today to make every organization a little bit better, what would that be? Stop slacking your reps asking for that deal update. Do your time. Get into his system. Understand where the deal is. They're doing the work. They know where it is. Stop bugging your reps on something you should already know the answer to. You just want a couple friends to follow you right after this episode. A bunch of reps are following Miles right now. Alrighty, Miles. Outstanding episode. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Alrighty, Mark. Let's do it. We got our two by two recap email. Give me your two. Number one. When you are trying to clone that first rep, make sure that you don't confuse personality with skill set. I thought that that was just an unbelievably awesome distinction in somewhere where you can get really confused. You can think that the person's winning because of personality, and, really, you need to find the underlying skills because everybody has a different personality. Number two is your customer's got the answers. And I know it seems cliche, but do you know how many people I talk to or look at their calendars and the last time they talked to a customer was six months ago? Too many. So listen. Like, another reminder, this is a heavy hitter. Been at Drift, super successful everywhere he's went. What was his number one bit of advice to get better and help your team? Talk to your customers. There it is. Number three. Do not do the things that you're horrible at. Hire for the things you are horrible at. Specifically, Mark, myself, and also Miles, all were big on hiring rev ops early. That is a huge one and a massive unlock. And then lastly, number four, you are never too early to be investing in enablement. That doesn't mean you're hiring an enablement person. That means you're doing enablement. Your reps are doing enablement. Miles wrote down two sentences on how he won every single one of his first 50 customers, and that's your enablement. Write down your ICP. Write down your initial discovery talk tracks. Write down your initial sales process, and make sure that reps five through 15 get that love too. Alrighty, folks.
