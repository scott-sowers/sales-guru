## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to the episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my cohost Nick Sigelski. How we doing? Arman, we got a great guest today. I'm in a good mood. Alright. Today, we have Ken Ammar, the number one all time top SDR at outreach.io. Huge sales organization. He's a team lead right now, and he has onboarded over 80 SDRs at Outreach, and he has a ton of tactical advice. Nick, why should people listen? So Ken has some really controversial but extremely effective strategies from getting responses from customers. If you wanna learn how to get more responses and have more conversations from from your prospects, this one is a must listen. Alright. Let's do it. Three, two, one. Roll it. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work in prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost two deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Ken, welcome to thirty minutes to Presidents Club. You know that we start every single show with three actionable tips from every guest, so let's get into your three. What's number one? The double tap play. 80% of your sales set leads come from 20% of your prospects. Call a prospect. They don't pick up. Call them back again with that exact same number. Okay. Give me two. Awesome. Number two, escalation play. If someone opens your email, you can't get them on the phone, send them a screenshot of the opens and that email history between you and the prospect. Okay. Cool. Round us out. Give me number three, please. Number three, the team prospecting play. Leverage your managers and your account executives. Send a first email, cc your manager and the account executive, and have them bump it on your behalf. Let's talk about number one. So the dreaded double dial in. Right? So can you tell us through what that sounds like? How that works? Does it piss people off? Awesome. It's actually a tip I got from one of my BDRs who just joined the team from, CrowdStrike. And, so he mentioned, like, hey. When you get a phone call from an area code or phone number you don't know, you're very like, you're not gonna pick up the phone. Right? But if you get a second call from that same number, you're likely to expect, hey. This might be important. I'll pick up. Right? We've been doing this all of this month. No one has ever said, hey. You called me twice. In fact, we've seen our connect rates go up, like, 10 to 15%. I guess my fear around that is people are gonna get mad at me. Like, why are you calling me so much? But you haven't had people be upset with you. And even if they get upset, right, like, you can work with that. Right? You can't work with radio sounds. You can say, oh, hey. Can I at least explain to you why I'm being so persistent? Yeah. And then you can, like, go right into it. No. It's so interesting because I, you know, I'll get telemarketer calls all day, and I just see these random numbers in these area codes. I even see a bunch of red ones on my phone right now. But then every time someone calls me twice, I'm like, okay. It's probably somebody who I told to call me. And it usually is, but every once in a while, it's not. That's brilliant. I wanna go back to the thing you were talking about, taking a screenshot of, like, your opens and your persistence. It sounds like that's something you're doing on a couple of these different tips. Can you talk about, like, what that strategy is and how you're leveraging it in different ways? Definitely. Yeah. So when I was in the SDR at Outreach, like, the number one problem I'd have with my emails get opened, like, dozens of times. Right? And I call them, I call them, and they'd never pick up. Right? And then I figured I use this tool called CloudApp. You can, like, screenshot a bunch of different things. And I'll send a screenshot of that with a couple arrows saying, hey. I noticed you opened my email, like, you know, 20 plus times. You might have forwarded it across the organization. That's awesome to see. Like, I'd give you a couple of calls, but you haven't picked up. I just like to start that dialogue. I guess, again, my my natural inclination is to be like, oh, are they gonna be like, your big brother? That's creepy. That's weird. You call me six times in a row. You're taking screenshots of the fact that I open an email. What's the general reaction, and are you having to overcome any, like, woah, big brother stuff? 100%. I'm watching this. It's like a fifty fifty play, the screenshot play. Right? Yep. But you can work with a response. At the very bare minimum, someone's gonna respond. Like, Arman, for example, will respond, hey, man. Like, that's really creepy. But in his signature, I'll have his cell phone. And even if I don't get him that time, like, somewhere down the line, I'll get him. So I'm an Outreach customer, and there are so many interesting insights you can see. And one of the things you see is the eyeball bubble. And I've seen people who they've looked at my email literally 30 plus times. And I'm like, what are you doing? And I don't know what to say. And so the other thing that we talked about in the prep call is, oftentimes, like, the moment you see that, are you just calling them right away? Or when someone replies, do you pick up the phone right away? Can you walk us through that? I'm not actually, like, oftentimes calling through my tasks. I'm sorting them by engagement. I'm actually calling through the activity feed. Anytime someone open my email, like, both as a rep now as a manager, I always coach monthly. Hey. Drop whatever you're doing and call them. Just pick up the phone and call them. They're most likely open that, email up on their cell phone. They're in the bathroom. They're on a walk somewhere. They'll definitely pick up. You gotta strike when the iron's hot. Well, Arman, this makes me think of the episode that we did with Ryan Reiser about going after the people who have shown engagement. And, like, you can track things like opened email, phone number work, and you almost wanna start your prospecting on the channels that you know are going to work. Like, there's nothing worse than hammering a phone number 12 times that it turns out is just going to an a voice mailbox that's not monitored. So it sounds like you're doing something similar, Ken. Definitely. How do you do it without letting that ruin your time blocks? Because I'm sure you teach your SDRs to do a full dial blitz for an hour long. Right? Mhmm. And so we're doing these DialBlitzes with data from Outreach, the highest time to connect. Right? Generally, that's kind of early in the morning or late in the afternoon. And in between, they're sequencing, sending out emails, and doing account research. Right? But the number one most important, like, KPI, at least in my book, is dials. Right? Everyone on LinkedIn is saying, hey. The phone is dead, and I love seeing that. I press like. I comment. I share all that stuff. The more people that think that, the less people are picking up the phones and dialing. You're doing all these unconventional things. Can you talk about some of the other channels that you're going after? Oh, man. I might get in trouble for saying this, but, texting. It can backfire. Right? But you wanna start building that relationship. And more often than not, it worked so much that it's worth it in my opinion. Like, you won't do a mass text blast to, alright. Here are my 200 prospects. Send the first text to everybody. You're typically following up after a call. Is that right? Exactly. And it it's not just to any call. Like, you know, I'm a big believer I mean, like, 20% of your prospects will produce 80% of your results. Right? These are the most high value targets. Right? The ones you know if they pick up the phone, you know you can get a meeting. You know you can get a sales accepted lead on. See, that's not creepy in my opinion. If you connect with somebody if I get on the phone with somebody and I say, yo, I gotta run, shoot me a text. Right? I actually welcome that. And so if somebody says, yo, I'm in a meeting. I gotta call you back. You can actually save them some time by saying, hey. I'm actually just gonna text you instead. What I'd be really curious to do is I wanna break down some of your cold call stuff because I know you have some really interesting strategies there. Would you mind going through us, like, cradle to grave through a cold call if we break it down piece by piece? We've done a couple different styles on cold calls. Right now, we're currently using, hey. Like, thank you so much for taking my call. Right? Because we're in the middle of this pandemic, because we have to lead with empathy. Prior to that, we were using, hey. Did I catch you at a bad time? So if the prospect said no or yes, we'd say, okay. Well, no worries. I'll be super brief. Here's why I'm calling. Right? And we're still using that. A lot of our messaging on the phones has had to change. We've had to adapt on the fly because of the coronavirus pandemic. One of the things that you were telling me earlier is you you were talking about, you pick up the phone, you'd say, hey. It's a sales call. Right? Do you still use that? 100%. You gotta be upfront with them. Right? And, like, the one unique position about Outreach is that we sell to sales leaders. Sales leaders love someone who's just, like, really upfront, can challenge them a little bit. So can I hear what this sounds like? Can we have Arman pretend to be the sales leader? And and maybe don't rip Ken too much, Arman, but I I really wanna hear what comes out of your mouth when the phone's picked up and how you would go about booking a meeting. Ring ring. Hey. This is Arman. Hey, Arman. This is Ken with Outreach. Am I catching a bad time there? Sort of. What's going on? Awesome. Well, do you have a quick thirty seconds for me to explain why I'm calling you? I suppose I can entertain that. How can I help you? Perfect. Well, hey. I'm actually reaching out to you right now because, you know, I noticed you're hiring for SCRs and SMB account executives over at Carta. They're tasked with generating pipeline specifically in the SMB tech space. I'd love to show you how we're working with competitors in your space like x, y, and z to help reduce results in pipeline. You available for a quick chat tomorrow at 03:00? You know, honestly, like, everyone everyone tells me, like, they're gonna help me get a million more deals in my pipe. Right? So I I need a little bit more than that. Like, what what the heck do you guys do? So really high level, we help your team sell more. I'm curious, Arman. If I was to sit down with one of your reps today, what would you say the biggest struggle day to day is? Jeez. I'm, like, hounding them to hit the phones more than they do. They got a lot of call hesitation. Oh, man. I I totally understand that. Could you tell me a little bit more about that? Yeah. I mean, like, you know, I I don't think activity is everything. But, at the same time, like, if you can't do $25 a day minimum, then, you know, it how how can you call yourself a salesperson? Right? I I oftentimes find that there's a phone hesitation behind, rep selling in this age where they think cold calling is dead, and I I happen to believe that people should continue hitting the phones. Definitely. And what's your top rep doing differently? I think he's hitting the phones. He's hitting phones. Well, listen. That's actually exactly why I'm reaching out to you right now, Armando. If you have thirty minutes tomorrow, I'd like to walk you through how Outreach can help them. Increase the activities of your reps and in turn help generate more pipeline for you and your team. How's tomorrow three look? You know, I I'm just swamped, man. Could you could you send me an email by chance? Definitely. And, you know, I gotta be upfront with you there, Armand. You know, we're both in sales, and we know that send me an email is a very common objection we get. It seems like more activities, more connect rates, that's kind of an area of importance for you and your team. Right? Yeah. It is. It's just, I I I'm just a busy guy. And I totally understand that. But, you know, I I'm curious. If we could, you know, increase the output of activities by 30% and, kinda show you when the best time of day to connect with prospects is, are you really telling me that's not worth, like, twenty, twenty five minutes on your calendar tomorrow? Alrighty, man. I'll I'll give you the meeting. Well done, man. Dude, the the persistence is is amazing. Awesome. Thank you. Arman's a tough customer. I would hate cold calling him. I love doing call teardowns. A couple things to point out is, like, the you can hear the tenacity in your voice. You're not this timid cold caller. The other thing is when you jumped into your value prop, you're just talking about me. You weren't saying, Outreach is a solution to do x, y, and z. You say, hey. I noticed that you're hiring SSCRs and SMBAEs at Carta, and you did your research, and you basically just described a problem that I'm having. And then you just just said that you're gonna solve that problem for me, which is exactly how it should be. One thing Ken did that it seems really basic, and I think a lot of reps know this, but there are some that don't, is he gay he made it really easy for Arman to book some time. He said, how's tomorrow at three? Instead of saying, hey. When's the best time for you? You're giving him a softball. Tomorrow at three? Sure. Okay. Boom. I can get that on your calendar. What's the best email address for you? As opposed to forcing him to think and do more work, you're already in interruption. So that's a basic tip, but offering that time slot is something that I think reduces some of the friction on the cold call. If you were to offer someone, like, eight, 03:00 tomorrow or 04:00 tomorrow, they're gonna think on both of those and not, like, no. I don't wanna meet tomorrow. Ken, I kinda wanna dig into something here that you were talking about on the prep call, and it's sequencing two point o. And it's this idea of I think a lot of us talk about sequence and cadence related to net new prospecting. But you're doing it for things like lost opportunities, rejections that you've gotten in the past, etcetera. Can you talk about some of the other areas that you're building out a contact strategy on and what that looks like tactically? Definitely. And so, like, the point of any sales engagement platform is to get replies as fast as possible. Right? And what I've noticed, like, across, like, a lot of customers and a lot of other SDR teams, they'll get, hey. I'm not interested. Hey. Take me off your list. Right? And then most SDRs will leave that be, and they won't take action on that. Right? Here, what we do at Outreach, we have a template for, hey. I know I'm not interested. Right? We'll, have a template to counteract that, and then we'll have what's called a reply follow-up sequence. Over half of our, meetings actually come from that sequence alone. Anytime someone takes the time to respond to you, you've kinda opened a dialogue, and you can work with that. Gotcha. And what are you saying? The actual cadence itself is just bumps of that original message. Right? Because that original message where you put in the time and after the personalization, Like, for example, if you responded to me, Armand, and said, hey. No. I'm not interested. I can kinda reiterate, hey. Well, I'm I'm curious. Your SDRs and SMB AEs that you're hiring have these listed responsibilities. Here's how we'd fit in and help your team generate more pipeline and, ultimately, more revenue for your team. And then the bumps would be like, hey. Any thoughts on this? Would love a quick reply when you get a chance and so on. So you're also doing this on confirming meetings we were talking about. What's that look like? Oh, man. Like, so many SDRs think once they get a meeting on the books, like, their job is done. Right? And, like, it it's the biggest, easiest area of of opportunity for a lot of SDR teams. Really just locking down the meeting, it's a text message or an email. Right? And you cc the account executive that they're gonna meet with. Right? We've actually started taking it a step further. What we've started implementing that's seen, like, a really significant increase in, meetings being held is sending just a small, like, $5, $10 coffee gift card ahead of the meeting. Hey. Really looking forward to meeting with you tomorrow at nine. Here's a coffee gift card. Enjoy some coffee on us. It's worked really well. I might steal that. Like and I might change the language to be I'm super excited for the meeting, and I want you to be too. So here's another two hundred milligrams of caffeine to really get you rocking. You'll use sequences for lost opportunities. Can you talk about what that sounds like? Oh, man. Lost opportunities are like gold. Right? Lowest hanging fruit. Like, I mean, we're all in in sales here. We're not gonna win all the time. Right? In fact, we lose a lot. Right? And a lot of the reasons why we lose are mostly because of lack of follow-up or, just bad timing. And so, like, when you have a sequence for lost opportunities, it's really simple. The first email is based off of the closed lost reengagement instructions. Let's say, for example, I went out to the Houston Rockets, right, which we're actively prospecting. It was bad timing the last time we met because the NBA season got canceled. I could send them an email now and say, hey, Gretchen. Thanks so much for, taking my email. I actually noticed, you know, we were in talks with you guys about six months ago, and the timing wasn't right. I'd love to pick up that conversation. When we last met, you were interested in x, y, and z. And these are all coming from the opportunity notes from the account executive. I kinda like the thing where you're reiterating, hey. When we last spoke, this is what you were interested in. Because, frankly, Gretchen's probably got 40 different things that are on her plate. And, again, you're making it one step easier for her. You're doing the work for the customer and saying, here's the thirty second quip of of why we were even talking in the first place. As opposed to the lazy way an SDR could do it, which is, hey. Bubbling this up. We were talking six months ago. Ready to resume this? One thing that we haven't gone through in a lot of other interviews, Ken, is what is the actual email structure look like? So when you're having SDRs write cold emails, you often see, like, these massive, massive books that are being written, and then you see other ones that are, like, super short and unprofessional. How do you coach your team to write good emails? We kinda base our emails off of this account research. Right? We have different plays to run, kinda like in football. You wanna choose the best play for that best prospect. Right? Like, hiring for SDRs and account executives, that's like a bread and butter play of ours. Right? Sometimes what we'll do, if we can't really get a ton of dirt for, like, the first email, we'll go in, we'll request a demo, and then we'll time how long it takes for that, company to get back to us. Yeah. It's a really high performing thing. We have a template built out. Hey. Like, we requested a demo on your website. It took forty eight hours for your reps to get back to us. We can cut that down to two minutes. Are you available to chat? And then what about the actual length of the email? Anything to be had around, like, the structure? Is it leading with context? Is it ending with tailoring? How do you weave that in your email? Definitely. So, like, the first thing would be, like, the hook. Right? Something that gets the process extension usually, like, for example, like, something we all did fall to, I guess, is, like, a local school or a local team. Right? But then kinda tying that to the value prop. And I noticed on LinkedIn, Armand, that, you're the director of sales. You've grown revenue 200% in the last two years. That's awesome. I did actually do some research and noticed some of your responsibilities include x, y, and z. Insert value prop at the very bottom. Here's how we help. A lot of people will either lead with my company does x or they wait to hit the context button at the end. And the bottom line is at the beginning of a cold call, you have fifteen seconds to get someone to sit up in their chair. Otherwise, you've lost them. And the same thing goes for a cold email is if you don't get them after that first line, it's done. And so you've gotta front load your context. That's why the emails we structure, they're always context value ask context value ask. And you did that in your cold call too. Awesome. What about subject lines? What are you guys doing around subject lines, Ken? So our subject lines contain context. Right? For example, like, Arman, quick LinkedIn sales and app search, we'd see that Bob and Fred just joined his company as SCRs. Right? If you put Bob comma Fred dot dot dot, Arman's, like, boss, like, Mary, for example. Right? Question mark. That's gonna get his attention because he knows Bob, he knows Fred, and he knows Mary. So just really anything that's super contextual to the prospect itself. I've seen subject lines like double your pipeline by 10%. I'm like, I'm sorry. This is a marketing or an advertising email. This is horrible. But if someone sends like, hey, Arman. Saw you're hiring four SDRs as a subject line. I'm gonna open it. I I mean, Ken's even going one level further. I think he's able to see, Arman, you just hired these two SDRs, Bob and Frank, and he's putting their names in the subject line. Let's say you have a 14 touch drip, and let's say we're just focusing on emails right now. How often do you just bubble back the same subject line versus switch it up to something that might say just called or some sort of breakup email? Definitely. So our first two bumps, this is for the Goji sequence, by the way, our highest performing outbound sequence. The first two bumps are just r e subject line, r e subject line again. Right? And then the first new email chain is our best performing template. And so we regularly audit our templates. The highest performing one will be that the new email chain. So I wanna ask about the breakup email because you mentioned it, Arman, because I've never sent a breakup email in my life. Part of the reason that I don't send it is I feel like it it gives the customer you're saying, hey. I'm gonna stop reaching out. What's actually in that email if you're sending it, and where we go from there? Alright. So very controversial opinion. Alright. Oh, god. All the LinkedIn thought leaders are not gonna like me for saying this, but I love breakup emails. Yeah. Both as an SDR and as SDR manager. I think one of my most favorite emails was just a frowny face. That's it. Are you serious? I love that. People would open that and why? But you gotta think at this point, like, they've been through a whole cold outbound sequence, 16 steps over thirty one days, and they haven't responded. Right? The whole point is just to get a response. Right? Because you can work with that. You can't work with sounds. Are you doing, like, the colon and the ellipses, or are you doing an emoji? The colon and ellipses. Oh, I like it. So the folks who are in the super old Androids can still see it. That's so funny. Dude, that's really creative. One thing that that we would do is we would do the breakup email. I got rid of, like, all those ridiculous alligator emails. I actually believe it works because it's a push away. There are a lot of people who are just on that cusp of saying yes, but it's not enough to get them to say yes. But when you say the door is closed, they're like, alright. Fine. I'll take the meeting here. And then one thing we'll do is we'll send one more email after the breakup email that seems really personalized, where we'll say, like, by the way, I was actually just thinking about our conversation. Like, I never even stopped to ask, are you the right person who manages this stuff? And that email is the highest response email in our whole sequence. 100%. Like, we have, like, a sequence just for referrals, and we know it's the right person, but we'll ask, are you the right person? Because any sales leader will be like, yes. I am the right person. We've talked a lot about a lot of good habits out there, but there's one thing that oftentimes happens in most sales orgs that you just hit on is people start to develop bad habits. And so if there was one thing that every sales rep on every sales floor needed to drop today and stop doing immediately to be more successful, what would that be? I feel like a lot of sales reps aren't, like, super efficient in their day. It's a really, like, simple thing, but, like, I'll see some of my my, more tenured SDRs. They'll do a lot of, like, non selling activities, like trainings and, like, syncs with other SDRs to teach them. Your calendar is like your paycheck. Start blocking off your calendar early. Start, like, doing a mandatory one hour a day just for one specific thing. Right? Hyper focus, and you'll get great results. Sweet. Alrighty, folks. Everybody stay tuned for a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Your top four takeaways from the episode with Kenamar include, number one, double tap the phones. If you call someone once they don't answer, call them again. They're gonna think that it's someone that's actually calling them for something important. Number two, the moment you see someone reply, call them. Don't write some massive long drawn out email response. Pick up the phone. They're already looking at your email. Number three, use a cadence for everything. Replies, opportunities, objections. Never use your own mind to think through what the next step is. Use a cadence for that. And then number four, if you see somebody opening your emails, just call it out. It's okay to be a little bit human. Nick, how can people help us out? Look.
