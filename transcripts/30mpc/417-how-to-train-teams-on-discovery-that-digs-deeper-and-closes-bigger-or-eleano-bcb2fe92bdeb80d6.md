## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Frogg, and I'm here with my host, Nick Sigelski. And this is round two in the live recording studio with the one and only Eleanor Dorfman. If you missed her on the last one, she is one of the greatest sales leadership guests we have had ever. She has led sales organizations at three awesome companies, Clever, Segment, and most recently at Retul, super hot company. Mhmm. Nick, why should people listen? So Eleanor takes us through her learnings in moving from feature selling, which she says, like, you can close a ton of business with feature selling. It's not necessarily a terrible bad thing, but two, value selling where deal sizes get bigger, where you start to move up market. And she takes us through the learnings from those journeys that she's had. And she talks about a lot of really interesting approaches to, one, craft this stuff, two, roll it out up front to your team, and then three, reinforce it so it's not just this big hurrah that gets forgotten in two quarters. Ardie Elnort, welcome back to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get you three. One, on a first call, when you're doing discovery, don't let yourself say your company name. It's really easy and to use a demo to talk about a pitch Mhmm. To move to a deck as a crutch. But if you force yourself to do the type of discovery you need to do to close a great deal, you will never talk about your own company. And so if you set that as a rule, you will, by definition, get much, much richer discovery as a result. What's number two? Number two is actually extending the you're not allowed to say these words one step further. In deal reviews internally, we set expectations that there are certain words you can't say. You can't say role based access controls. You can't say front ends. You can't say UIs. Because if you don't say those things, then you're not just saying, hey. They need this feature, which is why they wanna buy something. They need to take it one or two steps deeper. They're trying to launch a new product, and they need support tooling to support that. They're trying to launch a new market. They're trying to restructure their engineering org and drive operational efficiency. If you're not allowed to talk about certain features or retool or segment or pave specific things in a deal review, you end up talking a lot more about the business problems you're solving for a company, and you did a much richer and more productive deal review that's actually actionable and helps people sell instead of just drilling an inspection. So good. What's number three? And then number three is that POCs are actually an amazing place to do discover business value in addition to technical value. So when you think about POC, it is for the technical win. You are validating your required capabilities, but it's also at a moment in a deal cycle when you have the most leverage. Your prospects ready to get started. They need access to your SCs, to your resources, to your expertise. And so when you have a shared template and evaluation criteria that you fill out with your prospect, it's okay to put business value in there. Why is this important to them? Make them do a little bit of the work too because they're trying to get access to a very valuable resource that you have, and you're trying to get access to that valuable information that will ultimately help you in negotiation and closing. Let's actually start with definitions because you talked about three different types of selling. Feature selling, use case selling, and value selling. There's also solution selling. You know? There's a lot of ways of selling. So since we're mostly gonna focus on moving from feature to value selling, can you define what each of those are for me? When you're starting out, you know, you're validating product market fit, you're figuring out willingness to pay, you're testing everything, you're seeing what lands, what features are valuable, not And you've got your early adopters, the people who come to you really excited about your product. It's easy to just say, okay. You wanna solve this problem? Amazing. You need SAML. You need role based access controls. You need, provisioning management. You need a programmatic API. You need governance and orchestration. Amazing. Okay. The deal's done. Mhmm. And you can close a lot of deals that way in the beginning. And, honestly, for the lifespan of a company, you can always close deals that way, and that's okay. But as the company matures, as the market you're selling and matures, you need to evolve your selling motion, And it needs to go from what features do you need to what problem are resolving for your business, and why does that matter, who with power cares about that, and what budget can we attach to. And moving from here are these features where you can really only get access to low level buyers and smaller deals to 7 figure deals with CTOs and CIOs require attaching to things they care about. Mhmm. And that's very different. They don't care about SAML. Mhmm. They care about running their business. They care about growing their revenue. They care about derisking. That evolution from feature selling of, hey. Do you need these things? To where are you trying to go as a company, and how are we going to be part of that high level initiative is the transition from feature selling to value selling. For me, it's the big difference between priority based selling and problem based selling. And you still sell to problems when you're doing priority based selling. But problem based or feature based selling is you go into a meeting, and let's say that you have an email canon that lets you send 10 times as many emails. You're asking questions like, how do your SDRs send emails today? How many emails would you like them to send? Etcetera. When you go into priority based discussions, you're typically asking things around, okay, what are your pipeline goals overall? Yep. Where are you struggling the most in terms of meeting that next board goal? And you need to find the two or three biggest business priorities, and then you need to figure out how you attach the problems that you solve to those priorities versus a lot of feature based selling. It's like, let me see which of the four things I solve for I can throw out the customer and then say that I have the solution to this thing. That is good enough for 4 and 5 figure deals. But if you wanna sell 6 and 7 figure deals, you have to have something that you can ladder your product underneath that they've already dedicated half of their company resources towards. Yeah. I mean, if I think about this from a a rep's perspective, I wanna go into actually the value selling piece. So much of my behavior as a rep is gonna be driven by what I know my manager is going to be asking me when we get into that deal review or when we talk about my business. And if I know that my manager is not gonna accept me saying, yeah. They need rules based or role based access. I know now when I get on my next discovery call and the prospect is like, yeah. You know, we're really looking for something with role based access. I can't just accept that. I need to ask, okay. Well, what's driving that? Help me understand the problem you're looking to solve that is making you want that. And so from the top down, when you enforce, you're not allowed to just accept that in a deal review. Rep will not just accept it on a sales call. That's one of the ways you talked about reinforcing value selling. Let's actually take one step back and talk about you rolled out the move from feature to value selling. I think at segment as well as retool, if I'm correct. Yes. Exactly. Me personally, it's Okay. Sales leadership and segment. Let's go into what does the upfront launch of that move actually look like, and then let's get into some of the reinforcement tactics that you used. It goes back to a different stages of the company. You're gonna need a different sales methodology, and you're going to need to evolve it. And you're inevitably gonna hit some point where when you need to start doing larger deals, you're starting to do big deals with huge companies where it's all so much more complex. You're bringing in really senior reps to tackle those. It's time to evolve your sales strategy. Mhmm. And so at Segment and at Retul, we launched a value based selling methodology. And we partnered with a consultant and actually took the entire leadership team and built out what is our approach to value based selling and spent days at off sites. And it requires a huge commitment across the company because it's not just sales. Again, you never just win alone or lose alone. It's sales. It's product. It's marketing. You all need to be it's it's the executive team. Everyone needs to be bought into this transition, and it needs to involve a commitment from every part of the company. With both companies, we engaged with a consultant, and then we did a bid launch with training, at sales kickoff with reinforcement trainings throughout the year. Could we talk about that transformation? Because my early stage iterate, listen to the customer brain freaks out when I hear, okay. We've been selling a certain way for the last two years. We're so close to the customer. We're so close to the product. Let me hire someone else to come in who doesn't have context on my business and tear up my sales process. How did you make sure that they weren't just giving you the cookie cutter process that they've applied to every other enterprise org? How did you actually know that this transformation into this new sales process was going to work? Well, it's not like a huge one eighty. You're not gonna say this has been working. Don't do it completely differently. You're gonna say, how do we take what's been working and build the next layer on top of it? Mhmm. How do we make sure new reps who are coming in have an even richer enablement path and ability to be successful? How do we get our win rates up across the board? How do we take what's really, really good and build on it? And how do we make sure it's our own? Like, when you start as a VP of sales or a CRO at a new company, your previous playbook is not necessarily going to work. There's always some element of pattern matching of what's worked in the past and problem solving from first principles. And I think building a new sales methodology is the same thing. There's an element of pattern matching with the experts, the consultants who've done this 50, a hundred, two hundred times and know what works paired with the first principles thinking of the people who are closest to the customer and the problems you solve. And it's why you build it together and why it's such an upfront investment to build it well because no consultant can build it in isolation or it'll just be this bolted on thing that doesn't work and is inauthentic. It has to be built with your sales leadership, with your creative reps. Who are those reps who've been doing really well? Bring them into the process. Make sure they're informing it. Who are your sales engineers who are really effective? Bring them into the process. Who are your PMMs who've nailed every product launch? Bring them into the process. Who is the product team that's been closest to the customer? Bring them into the process. And if everyone's involved in the process, then it's actually something that's uniquely your own, but it's formed by best practices that have worked across dozens of companies. As you think about those big off sites where you had cross functional leaders in there, talk to me about some of the biggest changes that you all made to how your org sold, maybe both from a methodology perspective, but then also from, like, a cross functional collaboration perspective. I think some of the biggest changes is you all start speaking the same language. Like, I actually think if you do this well, it helps bring all of the teams more closely together because you develop this common language tied to these value drivers or how you're implementing this. So then when you're launching a new a new product it's grounded in that value selling language that you all agreed on. When, you're putting together a new pitch deck, it's grounded in that value selling language. So I actually think the business transformation is how it makes all the teams start thinking the same language. And then the other transformations, I think, are just subtle. It's you're digging you're spending more time on discovery. You're you're speaking a a new framework in deal reviews. You've updated your Salesforce. Like, so much of it is just you make the Salesforce have the updated exit criteria for for stages. You have more examples in Salesforce. You have the Salesforce fields reflect the new methodology. But it's not some crazy change. It's just building on what's worked and building in those guardrails and building in a common language. Could you give an example of how you used to run discovery in the feature based world and then how you change that to value based selling? I think that the biggest one is when we used to run discovery, you would just do whatever you wanted to do. There was no way we ran discovery. It was just a first call. It wasn't discovery. And then we moved into a discovery bank of questions. And then we moved into when you work with, the command of the message methodology, they have these four boxes for discovery, current state, negative consequences, future state, positive business outcomes. And we shifted into a world where you'd have those four boxes and you're filling them out when you're on the discovery call. And then you're able to have this visual of what have you not done discovery on yet that's going to inform how you run the deal later. And so then we moved into this world where, hey, you can't talk about retool on the first call. Because if you're talking about retool, you're not doing discovery. Yeah. And if you're talking about retool and you're using retool specific language, you're not actually learning the customer's pain and the customer's negative consequences and the customer specific language, which you should ground the rest of the deal in. So I would say that was the biggest is moving to thinking about it from we're asking enough questions to be able to progress to a POC to do we have these four boxes filled out? Do we have the information we need to ultimately be the foundation for a business case down the road? You know, it's funny just you're so specific about we're not allowed to use this word. We can't use the company name. We can't use the features except well, it's actually really funny because it makes me think we recently had the CRO of Gong, shave Shane Evans on the podcast. And he actually took a inverse approach to it where he mandated that his team I don't know if it was a mandate, but he was like, they set up a tracker in Gong for the AEs had to use the word or highly encouraged to use the word outcomes on their discovery calls because it was incentivized to ask the prospect, well, what are the outcomes that you're looking to accomplish with this initiative? And so he sort of did the inverse of, like, we set up trackers to make sure people use the word that he wanted them using. I think with Regal Yeah. Why that would be a little tougher is we're an open ended platform. And so the business value you're gonna deliver is actually gonna look radically different across every deal. Yeah. The playbook is actually in how you run the deal because every deal is going to look really different. Mhmm. People are gonna buy it for their engineering team. They're gonna buy it to solve a sales problem. They're gonna buy it for rev ops. They're gonna buy it to build support tooling. They're gonna buy it to attach to an AI COE. It's going to look really different. Yeah. The way you have to build your structures to support an open ended product is I actually think, like, you can't talk about retool because you have to let the customer lead you Mhmm. To where the business value is that you'll attach to. Yeah. I wanna connect the dots on something that you mentioned earlier in the interview, which is this creates a shared language not just for your sales team, but for every single team in the organization. You and I actually worked with the same product leader, Harim, and she talked about how when we would even launch a product, we were using the value based selling framework. So if we're launching a product, what's the current state of the product? What are the negative consequences? Mhmm. What's the future state of the product? What are the positive business outcomes? It's really broadly applicable. It's actually a very helpful thing. Your marketing landing landing page is the thing. Mhmm. And so if you're ever struggling where it's like people are launching solutions in search of a problem on your product team or your marketing team is delivering language that's super feature heavy, this gets product marketing and sales, especially those three Yeah. And CS implementation all speaking the same language and basically doing a lot of the things that we do naturally in sales Yeah. Which is finding problem, quantifying problem, attaching it to a broader business initiative. So we have what this looks like in discovery. Yep. Let's say that you have your current state, negative consequences, future state, positive business outcomes. Where do you take those things in the sales cycle? Do you roll those into a business case? Are you rolling those into a POC? What happens next? All of the above. Those four things are gonna be the sort of foundation of your POC, of your business case, of ultimately how you defend the value of pricing. If you have all of that, you're able to create a compelling event. It enables you to create a timeline that you're working backwards against. So to me, they're the foundation of the rest of the deal cycle. When you're in a POC very tactically, you need to have required capabilities that you're testing. So what are the required capabilities that will lead to that future state? And it ties back to what I was talking about with the value selling and the business problems in the POC. Because when you're putting together those required capabilities, you can say, how does this map to the future state? How does this support your positive business outcomes? Because maybe down the road in negotiation, someone's gonna be like, well, we don't really need this. So can we pay a little less? And you're like, absolutely not. This is critical because this is how you're going to x y z. And we know that that's important to you, and we're going to say that to you in the own language of your company. And it takes this feature that you deliver, and you're able to map it to the customer's own language and stand behind the price point and really have conviction when you're doing the negotiation. When you think about rolling that POC now into a business case, now what you can do is a lot of times, reps will get to a business case and they'll be like, shoot. How do I quantify these problems that we've been talking about at the feature level? But now all you have to do is say like, okay. Qualitatively, here's the current state and the future state. Quantitatively, here are the negative consequences, and here are the positive business outcomes. And you already have a framework that you can carry through POC and through business case instead of trying to scramble to quantify this stuff at the end of your sales cycle because you've been running your sales cycle with these big value drivers from call one all the way from the beginning of your sale. And those positive business outcomes should be metrics based, and they should be something that you know someone with budget and power and influence cares about. So then you know that that's where your business case is ultimately laddering up to, and it's laddering up to something that you can put a bid dollar value next to that someone who didn't sign off on that budget cares a lot about. I wanna take it one layer deeper and make it really, really real for folks who are listening to this. So let's say you're talking with a rep and you ask them about those four different elements. What does a good answer sound like for each of those four? Current state is, when a new internal tool needs to be built, someone builds out a PRD. They submit it into Jira. It sits there for nine and a half years. Maybe an offshore development team ultimately prioritizes it, but, ultimately, they need to build something hacking themselves. What are the negative consequences? You're not able to move faster on product launches. Your, have human error for very business critical processes where you can make a mistake that could ultimately end up costing the company money. You are overhiring because you need 10 more people to do something that if you had good software to solve the problem could be solved by two. So too much headcount, slow processes, human error, slower product launches. What does the future state look like? Oh, you have a platform to do this. You can go from idea to iteration to prototyping to iteration very quickly. You're able to speed up your product launches, so reduce time to launch. You're able to not have to use as heavy an offshore development team. So you reduce the FTEs or resources you need to use to build internal software or not hire to solve a problem. Then you know, okay. The CTO, you wanna keep your head count down? Great. Let's attach to that. That's something every CTO is gonna care about. Time to value for your product launches. Someone very senior is going to care about that. How do we take that time to launch from three months to one month? Yeah. How do we make sure you've got human error where you've messed up some things that impact your customers, you lose customer trust? How do we take that error rate from x percent and move it down to zero? Really interesting, actually, the current state and negative implications piece. I think about how you trained your team on discovery at Pave, Armand, and you built these discovery trees where you have the situation, the customer's current state, and then you've got the the problems with it and then the negative implications of it, which takes us to, like, the the the framework that we're doing here. So that's I I know how you trained against this. I wanna ask you about how, like, you actually trained your team on making sure that this stuff got rolled out properly, but you might have more questions that I'll defer to you for a moment. Reinforcement. Great. So let's tell me about that, Eleanor. I mean, you have to reinforce constantly. I think we do a discovery training every quarter. It is an evergreen thing. You are never gonna be a master at discovery. You're gonna be amazing at it. You can always get better. And, ultimately, others might disagree. I think discovery is the single most important part of the sales process. Mhmm. So we do trainings on it constantly. We take the reps that are the best at it. They work with enablement. They lead the trainings on that. It all comes back to this core methodology we're using, but we showcase really great discovery calls. We post them in, you know, the wins channel. We highlight them at all hands. We find those great Gong calls and we put them on the onboarding playlist for new reps, and then you reinforce it every quarter. There is never too much discovery training that you can do. What are the top things that you choose to reinforce in those discovery trainings? When you have an open ended platform, you need to let them take you there Yeah. And you need to be the one who's driving them there. Mhmm. So a lot of it is ask layered questions, ask why. Mhmm. Ask why again, ask why until you feel a little bit like an idiot for asking why again. Ask them who else would feel this pain. Mhmm. Until you feel conviction that you've gotten to the pain that's tied to a true negative consequence for the business, not just a pain point that's tied to the individual that you're talking to, that's the thing we have to reinforce the most. The thing that's hardest to do is to keep asking why, especially if you're selling to an engineer who doesn't wanna be on the phone with you in the first place. Yeah. Way too many people are training their teams based on the eighty twenty principle, which is they spend 80% of their time thinking about the big upfront training and then 20% of the time on the reinforcement of the concepts. When in reality, the best teams are doing twenty eighty. Yeah. They're spending 20% of their time doing the initial launch, but then 80% of their time jamming into their teams' heads every single week. So for us at Pave, we weren't using this exact framework, but we taught our reps how to do discovery. We built out our discovery trees. And then four weeks in a row, discovery tape reviews. And every single time, we would pause after every single question. We would pull up the discovery tree. Mhmm. And we'd be like, we're here right now. What's the question we need to ask to get here right next? Mhmm. And if it wasn't getting there, we had the opportunity to correct that stuff in real time Mhmm. Versus waiting for our next sales kickoff next year to be like, by the way, no one's been using the upfront contracts the last year. Let's make sure you're doing that stuff. Yeah. And I do think honestly, I love that approach. And I think celebrating great discovery, putting the people who do it really well on a pedestal, watching the gone calls together. At Sediment, we used to do what we called Sediment Theater, where we would, role play the discovery, and you'd have to do it in front of everyone. And it was excruciating. But, like, forcing yourself to get uncomfortable and ask those questions and knowing that that's what your leadership team cares the most about, just it's all about the reinforcement. Could you talk about other reinforcement rhythms? For example, you mentioned this comes in to deal reviews, which are probably happening weekly. How did your deal reviews change based on this? So we updated our deal review templates to map the sales methodology. So deal reviews now reflect that language, current state negative consequences, future state positive business outcomes. That's where we put the rule. You can't talk about front ends. You can't talk about UIs. You can't talk about things that ultimately don't map to business value, but ultimately absolutely come up on your calls and tie into why they're buying. But it's features and it's it's problems. It's not priorities. And so if you take away that language against taking away the crutches at every step, using language like UIs and front ends and SAML is a crutch and prevents you from being forced to go deeper into that business value that you're delivering. So it's making sure your deal review templates and your rhythm, like you do we do a deal review at stage three because that's right after the discovery. So we wanna make sure we're ready to win the POC. And if you can't go into a POC talking about front ends, you have to make sure you have enough information. Mhmm. And then it's actually easier to catch, hey. You might not have enough information yet. It might be premature to go into a POC right now. We don't know that we can go in and win. So why don't you go do another discovery call before we took off the POC? I remember at Carta, we rolled out Sandler, and we had this awesome two day training. We didn't do a ton of reinforcement. A lot of it didn't stick. But still, the reps that were there for the Sandler training, they remembered some of it. The problem is the moment we hired someone new, they didn't get to go through Sandler training. And so I'm curious. The last piece of reinforcement is stopping the leaky bucket. Yep. You hire someone new. How do you make sure that they get the same experience that the people got who actually went through the command of the message training? Yeah. So we redid our onboarding completely after we did rolled out a new sales methodology. So, we have amazing enablement team. So this is where your partnership with enablement is so important because the way you onboard reps is the way they're gonna learn. The calls you you surface in the onboarding, the way you do your demos or certifications. This is a very tactical thing that our enablement team suggested to me. I was resistant at first, and it was the exact right thing. When I started, we initially had a certification in order to get into the round robin, and it was a product certification, because Retool is a very complex and technical product. And I wanted to make sure people weren't intimidated by it. And so they had to do a product demo to get into the round robin. That is now a discovery demo certification. So you no longer have to do a demo to get into the round robin. You have to pass a discovery certification. And so we made discovery the central point of onboarding, that central point to pass the gate of getting into the round robin, of getting access to your accounts, of hitting your quota. And that was actually a very tactical and powerful shift because it changed the way we did onboarding and how we taught the reps how to prioritize what grade looked like. How did you enable your managers to make sure that the stuff was actually getting rolled out properly on the front lines? We have a very, very close relationship with the, enablement team and the managers, and I think that's easy to when you're 400 people, that gets a lot harder, I think, as you scale beyond that. But we have the enablement comes to the my weekly sales manager and with updates almost every other week to say, here's how we're thinking about this. Here's the new stuff. Are you using it? And then we do the weekly stand up, which we talked about earlier, where we're pushing frames out every week and then saying to the managers, this is the priority. Please make sure you're reinforcing. And then that's just in your one on ones with your team as well. I remember when we first brought in Sandler at Carta, there were three managers that were excited. There were two managers that were making fun of it. You can probably guess which teams didn't adopt it. How do you deal with, frankly, reps and managers who say, I know how to sell. I've been selling for a while. Why do I need to do this new methodology? And I think if they trust you and if you built a culture where it's we're all in this together and I'm not gonna be up here doing this top down, it's, hey. This rep was actually part of doing this. This rep was part of doing this. This rep who you all respect was involved in this process. This SE who you all want on every deal was part of shaping this. This amazing manager who you all wanna work for was part of building this. We took the best of you, and we built this. This isn't something that's top down. This is something where we took expertise, and we took our grassroots excellence and we built it together. And so this is something that is uniquely for us, and then you just have to keep talking about it all the time and it matters. And it's just part of your vocabulary. It's in deal reviews. People are gonna roll their eyes, but it's gonna become ingrained in the culture. You have to make sure everyone is 100% behind it from a leadership level. If I wanted to make sure that something got adopted, I would make my number one rep or my number one manager run the training. Exactly. And then they have to own it. Yep. So Morgan Mello, if I'm just delivering trainings to her and Mhmm. All this stuff, she might be like, I'm a really good rep. I don't wanna sell this thing. I'm like rep's delivering it. People are gonna listen. Exactly. We're not even if it's you delivering it or certainly if it's an outside consultant. That's right. Eleanor, another amazing show. We talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit, but now it's time to talk about a bad one. So what is one bad habit that every sales leader should break so that all teams get a little bit better? You might not be bought into something. Like, you might think Sandler is better than than command of the message. You might think it's not the right way to do that. You can never let your reps see that, and you have to let your managers know that they have to be a 100% in the boat on this all the time. Like, again, it only works if we're a unified front. And that can happen with comp plans. That can happen with methodology. But once a decision is made, it's you disagree and commit. And I think sometimes you have to say that out loud in a meeting, and you can't just assume that because you're pushing something top down, they're gonna do it. And so in meetings, I'll frequently say, okay, Let's do all the disagreements out there. Okay. Great. I hear you. Here's what we're gonna do. Do we all disagree and commit and say it out loud? And then you can't really go back on your word Yeah. Too much. Eleanor, two amazing shows. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alright, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Eleanor Dorfman. What do you have for your two? So my first one is ban certain words from deal reviews, typically stuff around, like, product feature and product language, in order to drive the intended questioning behavior from your AEs. For example, Eleanor talks about in deal reviews, you're not allowed to use the language roles based access because that is a very product specific thing. Instead, the rep needs to say, okay. Customer said they needed roles based access. Why? What's driving that? And so when you change your deal reviews, you change how your reps act when they're in front of customers. Number two, I love this one because I've been through so many different, like, like, certification programs in the past. I'm like, these are a waste of time. Don't really take them super seriously. Eleanor mandates that in order for a rep to get into the inbound round robin, they must complete their discovery certification. So in order to get what the AE wants, which is get some inbound leads, they have to do what you want as a leader, which is complete that disco certification. Brilliant. Number three. When you establish your value selling framework, whatever it is, you need to carry it through every step of your sales cycle. So, for example, if your reps are talking about the current state, the negative consequences, the desired future state, and the positive business outcomes in a discovery call, guess what they're going to demo about? Here was the current state you talked about. Here are the negative consequences. You can carry that through the business case. You can carry it through your proposal everywhere in your sale. And then lastly, number four, it is not just about that upfront training. If you're going to change your sales framework, you now need to update all of your sales stages. You now need to update your deal review templates. And then every single week, you need to make sure that your reps are doing the deal reviews with the new framework. Otherwise, you basically spent a $100,000 on a two day training that doesn't mean anything. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So one of the things that Arman talked about in this episode was when folks are typically rolling out training or upskilling for their reps, they'll take the eighty twenty approach where 80% of the effort goes into rolling out the upfront training, and then there's, like, a little bit of afterthought put into making sure that that stuff gets reinforced. And we've been thinking about this a lot at thirty minutes to presidents club. So one of the the solves for this is we rolled out something called the thirty minutes to presidents club club pass program. And maybe you can share a little bit about that, Arman, for the folks who are curious. If your team is doing upfront training and no reinforcement, it is fundamentally broken. Mhmm. But the reality is, like, not every team out there has the resources and the ability to train you once upfront, but then, frankly, every single week thereafter. Mhmm. And so if you want to be trained and coached by thirty minutes to Presidents Club, now is your chance. The Club Pass gives you access to three things. Number one, it gives you access to all of our trainings. Our course library starting with our inaugural cold calling course. From there, we have weekly coaching sessions. You can join email teardowns, cold call teardowns, discovery call teardowns, and more. And so you'll constantly have these concepts reinforced, and then you'll also be entered inside of a community Mhmm. Where you'll be surrounded by dozens and dozens of other reps who are doing the exact same things, where you can ask them questions, enroll in the 200 dial challenge, and reference tons of other sales decks, templates, call scripts, and beyond.
