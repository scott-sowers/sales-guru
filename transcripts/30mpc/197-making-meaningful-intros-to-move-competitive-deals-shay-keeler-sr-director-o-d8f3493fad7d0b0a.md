## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelstee. And whoo hoo. What a killer show with Shay Keeler. She is the senior director of global commercial sales at Outreach. Nick, why should people listen? Shay is an expert at moving your deals forward. This episode actually inspired me to go look at my pipeline and even look at ops where I had a next step on the books, but accelerate them even before that meeting happened. And so if you wanna move your pipeline forward today without waiting until your next meeting, you gotta listen to Shay. She's got some really good stuff to do just that. And a three, a two, a one. Let's ride. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Shay. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. So number one, I would say give everyone a a role to play on any external call. So oftentimes, we've got a big demo scheduled, and we have five executives coming on to this call. But they don't know what role they need to play on that or, like, when they need to provide value, and there's nothing worse than wasting an hour of everyone's time and not getting what you want out of it. So my best advice is to provide each individual persona a role that you want to play. So, for example, let's say you've got your s that's coming to the call, and you want your SC to only talk about and provide value in ways that you're competitively different than your competition because you know that they're more likely to trust you. Then give that role and give that example to your SC prior. You've got your sales manager on the call, and you want them to provide all the examples about how sales leaders can use outreach to provide value when coaching their sellers. Provide that to them. And then create space for them to actually talk. You get lots of times reps get so excited during a demo that they don't actually pause or ask any open ended questions and allow people to provide different value. So that that would be my tip number one. Beautiful. What's tip number two? Tip number two would be create a hit list for all open ops every week. So oftentimes, this is something that SDRs do really well. And then when you become an AE, you kind of forgot about that hit list. So every Monday, I would create two lists. One would be a list of all of your open ops that don't have next steps. And then you'd create a list of all of your open ops that you just need some kind of touch point on them. And you'd treat those two pretty different. Right? So if you don't have a next step on those open ops and you know that's so important, then you should be touching your champion or your coach at least once a day, providing different value and trying to drive that next step that you are looking to do. You don't need to wait. Like, if you've got something positive to say and you've got something that you can provide value to, then make sure that you're being proactive. And then I think on anyone that you do have a next step, it's still important for you to stay top of mind. Maybe you got delayed a week or two weeks to get that next step, but you wanna make sure that they don't go with your competition, which they very well could be doing. Right? So providing them a webinar or a link, I always like to say, like, hey, Nick. I thought of you and wanted to send this over. Like, here's an example. So treat that like your hit list every week. And then by the end of the week, the goal will be that you get either next steps on all of them, and you've moved the needle on any of those open ops that have a next step. I love it. Round us out. What's tip number three? Alright. Tip number three would be listen to your own calls every week. So I would say regardless if you're an SDR or an AE, typically, we all hate the sound of our own voice, but it's really important to spend time reflecting on your own calls and not just listening to top AEs or SDRs. So when I started as an AE of Outreach, what I would do every week is I would listen to my calls, and I would send Mark Costaglow the three things I did really well on that call and then the three areas that I would do differently. I would keep a journal and I would keep sending them to him, and I would also be able to reflect on it myself. This really helped Mark not only coach and develop me, but also show that I was, like, in this and I wanted to be successful. And it helps me proactively, you know, create pathway for promotion, etcetera. So, Shay, I wanna go back to this point around next steps. Yeah. You described a specific scenario that I think is really, really common especially today, which is, let's say I go through a demo. I'm selling this deal, and my prospect says, Arman, I really appreciate this. We like what we see, but I need a second to debrief with my team internally because we are looking at a couple other solutions. And let's just pretend that maybe there's a touch point on the books later or I might not even have a touch point on the books. How do I stay relevant and top of mind with someone who's clearly looking at competitors without being annoying? Yeah. So I think number one would be to at first sync with them. So regardless if they need to sync internally, it's like, hey, Armon. Let's get fifteen minutes on the books on Friday. I just wanna, like, touch base, see if there's anything I've missed that maybe my competitor is you know? Get them on your side and make it a win for them, not that you're just trying to beat out the competition. And then I think how else I would see relevant is people are busy. They don't wanna get on a call if there's no agenda and there's nothing they're gonna get out of it. So how can you provide, like, touch points or different things that can help that person? So, you know, maybe if I'm talking to a VP of sales and I know that they're struggling with AE prospecting, I'll intro them to my VP of sales that created AE prospecting and outreach. And all of a sudden, that's a win win. I'm not taking anything. I'm just giving you a new resource. Right? And so thinking outside of the box and thinking of ways that, like, it doesn't feel like you're always getting something from them, but you're providing value in different creative ways, but you're not letting them forget about you. So, Shay, I love this concept of the goodwill introduction. In other words, oftentimes, when you just follow-up on next steps with, hey. Do you have an answer yet? Hey. Do you have an answer yet? Hey. You wanna touch base? Hey. You wanna check-in? It's all serving you to your point. Mhmm. But the reality is once you start making offers to provide an introduction to someone who can help solve a problem, you're all of a sudden going to distort that prospect's reality when they're looking at other competitors as well. I'm curious in this specific example. I wanna come back to next steps in a second. But if someone says I'm gonna go look at a couple competitors, before you say buy, what do you tell them to make sure that they're looking for the right things? It starts at the beginning. Because if you do it right before, it's like, you know, a bad date or something. You're like, wait. Hold on. I promise I can, like, do better at that. You know, I think, ultimately, you need to understand what's most important to that person prior, and you learn that either in the discovery or beginning of a demo or throughout the demo. And then I think it's bringing it back to that. Not that you're talking badly about your competition or that they wouldn't be happy if they went somewhere else. So if there's certain things that I know that my competition can't do, hey, Arbonne. Like, I know that this is really important for you, that you have to have your AE start prospecting or you could lose your job based on what you told me. So here's the three things I want you to look for when you go to that demo, and we'll talk about that when we come back. But just look keep an eye out for that because I'm scared that they might not have that, etcetera, and get them planting and thinking about that stuff for that call. So I actually wanna ask you sort of a discovery slash how you position pitch outreach question because I've used outreach, and there are so many different things that it can help with. And there are so many functions that it has that support multiple different goals. And Yeah. I presume that you could run the risk of almost making a prospect be like, oh, this seems like more than we need if you overwhelm them with all the stuff that you do. And so how do you strike the right balance between showing them the great things that you can do that maybe your competition can't while also not being like, here's a list of 432 things that Outreach is able to do that, like, our biggest competitors can't do. Yeah. So I'm a firm believer of, like, on a really good demo, you should have three pains that you're trying to solve for a prospect, and you should demo to those three things. Like, I I bought a car. What my husband cares about versus what I care about is very different. I cared, like, color and that it was was fat and then it was, like, the certain brand that I wanted. Right? But he didn't care about that stuff. He cared about other things. And so I think keeping it really, really simple and just tying it back to, like, hey. I've shown you this. You told me you wanna increase AE prospecting, Nick. I'm just showed you how you can do that. Do you agree that this could help solve your problem? Mhmm. Yes? Great. Check. Move on. Right? And I could take you on a tour of Outreach for two hours and probably not even show you, like, what you actually need. So I think it all goes back to what does this person need, and what does this profit need, and do they have an emotional attachment to if you solve that or not? And then just show specifically those three things. So there's this company that I was advising the other day, and we were tearing down one of their tapes. And it remind me of exactly what you just said, which is the prospect came and wanted to solve an initial problem. And that problem was in the middle of the workflow of the demo. Mhmm. And what they did is they started with the same way they start every demo, which is this is how you do the integrations. This is permissions. Great. This is how you set it up. And it took them twenty minutes to get to the meat of what this person wanted to solve. And I'm like, guys, like, I know you wanna show how it all works together, but go be the heat seeking missile and go right to the first problem that they wanted to solve. And then at the end, be like, hey. Does this solve that problem? And if they say yes, then you can say, typically, when you're focused on things like this, the other types of things our customers are focused on are x, y, and z. And now that you've solved their first problem, you can start to go to other jumping points in your demo as well. And maybe that one thing is all they need. Maybe that's the ultimate thing that if you just could solve that, they don't need to see anything else, and they can grow into other things. Shay, I wanna go to this scenario that we were talking about. And this is sort of related where you've got the meeting, demo goes well, and they say, yeah. We're actually looking at a couple other competitors. Like, let's touch base in two weeks. And you succeed, and you get a meeting on the calendar in two weeks. And one thing that I recall has happened to me is, like, in that two week period, the customer will still be engaged with me, me, and they'll be sending me questions that, like they very clearly were questions seeded by my competitors. And they're almost like gotchas where the competitor was like, hey. Here's the four questions you gotta ask Nick's company. When you see that happening, what is your response? My first response that comes to mind is, like, I need to figure out if this person's a champion. Because if you're talking to someone that's below the line then it's not as risky as someone that's, like, an ATL that has a huge voice in that company internally. I wanna come from, like, a seeking to understand at that point and try to figure out why they were asking these questions and why that may be important to them. And then try to pivot it and show them if I've got the demo and that next step lined up, then provide the value of, like, why this actually matters and how we could do it better, etcetera. I mean, yeah, to that end, I think my response usually in that scenario was like, okay. Hold on. I need to not email this person a bunch of answers back because, one, that's probably gonna go right back to my competition. I actually would just say, I need to call this person and be like, yo. I got your email. It looks like you had a couple questions. Talk to me. And you get so much more context when you have that phone conversation with the person than when you just email back stock responses to their competitive landmine questions. Yeah. That should have been my first response because you're exactly right. So many times we type up these long, long, long emails, and then your competition now has have you answer and rebuttal all of those objections. And so always calling is number one. So I'm actually curious for both of you because this happened to someone that I was talking to the other day where a prospect sent a list of 20 feature checklists and requirements out of the blue. And in the original demo, it seemed like we had solved for all the outcomes they wanted to achieve. And then suddenly, after a week of thinking about it, they come back with 20 line items. And so, Nick, to your point, I was like, get on a call with them. But let's say you get on that call. What do you do? Do you just start going line by line? How do you reorient the conversation when you get a massive list of check boxes? I think you wanna understand where it came from. Did someone internally get involved and they said, hey, Nick. Here's actually the checklist in order for rev ops to sign off on it that we need to, like, get answered. Or was this an internal document that you just had never had access to previously? And so, like, really, again, seeking to understand and then figuring out what the best pathway forward would be for that. If it's this list of requirements and, like, technical, then, like, let's get a call scheduled with the person that created this document, and let's cover what is top of mind for you. And then I think it's also okay to ask them, like, hey. Like, I'm a little confused where this came from. Like, based on our demo, you said we are vendor of choice. So, like, what's going on? Has something else come up, etcetera? Because your competition probably knows how to compete against you and is probably giving them the things so that they can maybe potentially edge you out and win the deal. I mean, to that end. Yeah. Understanding where it comes from. Because if it was some random IT person who was like, oh, these are the things I think we need. You're gonna handle that totally differently than if someone was like, oh, wait. I used a different solution, and I think we should do this. And then they engaged a competitor. Like, you've gotta know where it comes from. Because if it comes from somewhere internally, they probably wanna meet with that person, and then you can address all of their questions. And, again, being like, okay. Let's again reorient around the goal that they originally had. And so, Shay, one of the things that I wanna ask you is one of the ways that I think we can ensure our deal and often beat out the competition isn't necessarily, like, perfectly handling the landmine questions or or even showing a better demo sometimes. Oftentimes, it's a it's a function of how fast the customer progresses through the evaluation cycle with you, where if they're looking at Outreach and a competitor and they get seven meetings in with Outreach after ten days and they've had one meeting with the other person, you have a better chance of winning that deal because they're like, alright. We're actually progressing towards solving the problem. And what I'm curious to learn from you are, what are some of the things that you and your team do intentionally to speed up how deep your customer gets an evaluation with you in a short amount of time? Yeah. I think time kills all deals. Like, everyone says it's the ultimate killer to everything. So I think number one is how you recommend the next step. So oftentimes, what happens at the end of a call is someone will be like, hey. So, Shay, like, when are you free to talk? Well, my calendar's packed for the next month. So I don't know. Like, maybe call me and we can talk in three weeks. But if someone says, hey. Let's let's talk at 02:00 on Tuesday. How does that work for you tomorrow? Like, oh, actually, that works perfect for me. Right? And then while I've got you, let's get this other call scheduled that we talked about. We need to get a call with your VP of sales to talk about pricing. Mhmm. What are their calendar look like for Wednesday at, say, 03:00 too? And line it up. And you should be in the driver's seat. Like, you shouldn't be in the passenger seat setting up next steps. So I think two is understanding, like, where you're at in, like, the sales cycle with the competition, and it's asking the tough questions that so many sellers avoid. I wanna know have they already gone through a sales process with someone, and I just in the box that needs to be checked. And so I'm gonna handle that different. And then if I know I'm the first person in and I'm actually the first demo, etcetera. And so I think it's really important for you to understand and ask that. Also ask who they're evaluating at the top of it because maybe you're the only person that they're evaluating. Great. Lucky you. Right? But in this day and age, they're gonna be looking at so many different vendors. And so ask those questions at the beginning. Also, I think on that last note would be, like, understand do they have a process, and do they know what their buying criteria is? Because buying teams and who's involved in all these different buying committees has changed a lot. I know two years ago, I could get a VP of sales to sign a contract, and I could be on my merry way. Now I've got, like, 15 people, and I've gotta have all these different approvals. And so I think it's also really important to understand what that looks like. So I'm curious, Shay. So you're working with someone who's, like, at the line or champion, and you've done a great job of hounding them for next steps and next steps and next steps over and over. And every week, they're like, we're evaluating. We're evaluating. We're evaluating. We're evaluating. We're evaluating. They're blocking you to get in front of power, and it seems like the evaluation is just dragging on seemingly forever. What do you do when these deals start to stall out? Do you confront it directly? Do you just go around them? Do you try to close loss the op? How do you know when a week touch base every single week for the last five weeks is too many? One is I like to ask the person. So, hey, Nick. I feel like I've been, like, I've been touching base with you every week now for the past five weeks. We had this idea of getting this to be able to go live in December. I think it's changed. Really take the pressure off and kinda come from, like, a human perspective. Never send that via email. Reps do that all the time, and it just never lands. Like, pick up the phone, send a text, ask for a quick call, and just try to level set and sit on the same side of the table. You know? Right now, like, companies are going through so many different things that maybe it's layoffs, maybe it's reorgs, etcetera. Like, understand what's going on. You know, sometimes people have personal stuff that comes up and gets in the way of the deal, and so try to seek to understand there before. And then I do like to go if if I'm at the line and I know I have nothing to lose, then I'm like, okay. Let's just shoot our shot here. Right? And can make the decision, then I will have my executive send a note to them and ask for an update, see what's going on, etcetera. Because oftentimes, you get an answer from an executive that you wouldn't get from the person that is, like, at the line because they don't wanna look like they couldn't get the deal done. It's like a shot to the ego. You know? And so or if I'm at the finish line, I have so many times too at the end of a quarter, I'm stuck in legal and I can't get a deal done. I'll have my VP email the VP of that company or CRO, and I get it back, like, almost immediately because they can go past everything. What do you have your VP say in that scenario? So it'll depend. If it's, like, stuck in legal, I'll have them say that. Like, hey, Nick. I know our teams have been working hard to get this done. I know we've been stuck in legal for a couple weeks. It'd mean a lot if we could get this deal done by the thirty first. It's our end of fiscal. Is there any chance we can make that happen? And if they can't or if there's, like, a hidden objection that we haven't been able to find out about, so oftentimes, that's how we find out about it. So I used to run this play at Pave with a lot of my reps where if there was a VP that especially if they had been involved in the sales cycle before, I could be the parallel VP of sales to their VP of HR while my AE was working with their director of people operations. There was one time I did it, though, and it totally blew up the deal. So the champion was sort of going ghost. It was supposed to be in red lines. It was going, going, going, and then just silence. One week, two weeks, three weeks went by. And I was like, what is going on? And we said, like, this discount expires, etcetera, etcetera. And so I sent an email, and I sent it all the way up the chain, and I was like, hey. Like, I wanna make sure that everything's okay. And everything seemed to be going well, and we haven't heard from the champion's name here. Right? Is there anything that I can do to help? Champion got back and was like, we're not moving forward with you anymore. This was my decision to make and totally blew up the deal. And so is that just, like, a one off case and I should look at that like an isolated scenario, or are there certain situations where I should tread more carefully and not blow up my deal by going above someone's head? I do think those are more one off cases than, like, actually, like, what happens typically across the board. I think too if you've done, like, what we talked about earlier of getting your VP to VP aligned and, like, having it be, like, a give, and they have a relationship and then things get stuck, all of a sudden, it's, like, even more normal for Mark to reach out and say, like, hey. I just wanted to check-in. I know we've had this convo. And so now you've got, like, a warm intro where maybe, I would say, like I mean, were they really gonna do it if that's what blows up the deal? Like, my opinion is no, but, like, I mean, it's easy for me to say in that regard. Yeah. The the way that I look at this one is there was previous contact. We gave the person a heads up. There was an existing relationship, and the person freaked out. That is a one off scenario. And oftentimes, what I find sellers will do is they'll take the one person who freaked out, who frankly wasn't gonna buy anyway, and they take that uncomfortable reaction, and they let it color all the other ways that they manage their opportunities on the real buyers. And the reality is if I didn't do that or if you didn't do that on your 10 other opportunities, five of those ones wouldn't have closed. And this happens on cold calling too where you use an opener and you land four, but the one where someone cusses you out is the one that makes you think about those first four and whether or not you should ever use that opener in the first place. So don't build your buying cycle around the no's. Build your buying cycle around the yeses and know that sometimes you're gonna get a visceral reaction in return. Yeah. I mean, you never had that deal, Armond. I think you sent a nice email and they send you, like, the deal wasn't coming in. But I wanna talk about something that we were talking about on the the pre call, Shay, which was this idea of inoculating against deal risks. Armand, I hate to tell you, I don't think there was anything you were gonna do on that deal, man, to inoculate against that deal risk. But, Shay, I know that you and your team are doing things in deal cycle and then also towards the end of the deal to inoculate against those risks. And I'm wondering if you can give me some of those best practices. Yeah. So I think my motto and kind of, like, what I think is super important is to be proactive and not reactive. As a sales leader, I'm thinking about how am I proactive to, you know, close and hit my forecast to build pipeline, etcetera, versus, like, being reactive. I think it's important to, like, involve other people into your deals. So especially larger deals, we get really emotionally attached to them, and they oftentimes become, like, the center of our whole world. And so that's really important to have different groups and committees involved in that to get feedback and to figure out if, like, your pulse is correct. Like, I just got off a meeting prior to this of a thirty minute sync I have weekly of one of our top deals in our pipeline, and we go through strategies, figure out risk or mitigation that we may need on that. And then we'll bring exact send if we need, and we'll bring in different stakeholders to figure that out. Two, I think it's really important to zoom out in line reviews from a leader and have a very crystal clear process and formula that you run so that you're not taken over by emotion. And what I mean by that is if you're behind and you jump into a pipe line review with a rep that's not pacing, you're just gonna tear up their deals. And you're gonna be like, why isn't this happening? What's this going on? Right? So if you think about it from a proactive standpoint I mean, number one, you set next steps. Right? Like, that's the no brainer. Two, get different stakeholders to provide opinion. And then three, like, look at it from, like, it's not your deal and that you're not emotionally attached to it. And, like, if this was someone else's, would you think this was healthy? And, like, what would you do if it wasn't? And so those are some of the things that I do from a leader. And then take the time at the end if you lose it the deals to, like, actually figure out why you lost them. Like, to Armand's point earlier, like, you can set trends by how you win deals. We also learn so much about why you lost a deal, and it helps you be proactive in the future and not constantly on your feet, etcetera. Shay, one thing that was really helpful for me as a rep was I would try to reverse engineer my manager's pipeline review questions to understand and unblock my deals even if they weren't actively hounding me on and off. And so is there anything, any framework, or any five point inspection that you use in your pipeline reviews that a rep can use themselves if their manager is really bad at doing pipeline reviews themselves? Yeah. So I learned my five points and how I run my blind reviews from Mark Casaglow. And it's like, I did the same thing every single time because it takes the emotion out of it. And so I think if you're a rep and you're looking at your pipeline, you wanna know, like, what's the persona that you're involved with? Is this someone that can make the decision? Do you understand how that decision gets made? Do you understand paper process, etcetera? What is your next step? If you don't have a next step, then what are you gonna do between now and next week to get a next step, and, like, what does that look like? And then what's your goal of that next step? So oftentimes, we think about, I've got a demo scheduled with Nick tomorrow, and great. I've got all the stakeholders. I know everyone I know on that call, but I don't know what I'm gonna do next as an AE. And it's super important to be constantly thinking about what are your next steps. And as a leader, you need to be guiding your reps to think and to start to teach them how to think forward so that I'm just coming in and it's kind of like admin check-in at the end of ramping a rep because they know exactly how I want pipeline reviews. And it's not for me, but it's for them so that we're constantly moving the deal forward. One of my old mentors, Darcy, talked about the difference between what do you wanna do and what do you wanna get out of a meeting. And a lot of reps say, my next step is to do a demo with this person. But the right behavior is actually to say, yes. I'm gonna do a demo, and that demo is going to allow me to get this thing at the end of the meeting. And that is gonna tell me if it's even worth my time to set another next step because otherwise, you end up on these demo trains that just go meeting and meeting and meeting when you're focusing on what you're doing in your next step instead of focusing on the goal of the next step to your point. To the point that you both just made about the inspection checklist and Arman doing it backwards, like, we even do it here at thirty minutes to presidents club because I run our sponsor sales, and Arman gets to play the guy inspecting my pipeline. And what we realized was if he and I aligned on, okay, what actually makes a healthy deal, we can remove the emotion of it where it's not me being like, oh, this one's definitely coming in, and Armand being like, no. It's not. No. It's not. We know what we need to look for, and so our pipe reviews are so much cleaner and far less stressful because we have aligned on what I should be reporting, and then we understand, okay. How do we move any of those individual things to healthy? And so what you're doing for your reps is you make it so much less stressful because they know you're gonna ask about the persona, are they at power, how they're making the decision, the paper process, the next step, and then what should be happening in the next week to move that deal forward. And if I'm your rep, Shay, I know, cool. When I meet with Shay, I'm just gonna report on those things, and it's gonna be a way better meeting. Hi, Shay. Well, this has been a phenomenal interview, but the clock is ticking. We are running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I am going to ask you about a shouldn't. So the last question, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of sales reps exhibiting you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Sales rep need to be more proactive versus reactive. So often, reps have a full pipeline, and they've got enough to absolutely crush their number for the quarter, and then they stop prospecting. Because they're like, why would I prospect? And then all of a sudden, you lose your biggest deal in your pipeline, and now you don't have anything to replace it. You know, same thing when it goes to listening to calls, etcetera. Boom. I love it. Shay, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon.

So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Shay Keeler include, number one, the Monday morning opportunity hit list. Every Monday morning, create a list of opportunities that don't have a next step or told you to call them back around this time, and call them, email them. Or even if you have a next step, see if there's a way that you can derisk a deal proactively. Number two, if someone is shopping, competitors plant landmines for them to ask for specific pitfalls during the competitive demo. Number three, when you're waiting for them to finish a competitive evaluation, make them love you. Send a goodwill introduction to a resource that will help that prospect while they are looking at other competitors. And then lastly, number four, the inverted pipeline review. You can review your own pipeline by asking the following questions. What's the persona that I'm going after? Do I understand the decision? Do I understand the next step? And if I don't have a next step, what am I gonna do to get one? Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? Well, Armand, while I've been touching all of our ops and moving the pipeline forward, you've been hard at work programming a robot. Yes.
