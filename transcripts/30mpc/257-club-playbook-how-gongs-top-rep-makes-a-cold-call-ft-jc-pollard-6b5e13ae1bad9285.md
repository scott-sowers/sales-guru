## Transcript

Good morning, everyone. I am JC Pollard. I'm an account executive over at Gong, and I am super excited to talk about today's club playbook, which is on how to open your cold calls. There are four main topics we're gonna cover today. First of all, why your cold call opener matters. Second of all, why the how is more important than the what. Third, we're gonna talk about using a permission based opener. And then fourth, we're gonna talk about something that's near and dear to my heart, which is I call a three why you. It is going to drastically increase your conversion rate. So here we go in three, two, one. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. The first part of opening a cold call is why is this important? I have no doubt that it back this up, but anecdotally, I would say the majority of cold calls are won and lost in that first, like, thirty to sixty seconds. That's when a lot of people aren't gonna give you a chance. That's when you're gonna get a ton of hang ups. And typically, that's what's gonna prevent you from even having the opportunity to pitch. But it's so important to dial in that first part of a cold call. The moral of the story is if you nail that, you're gonna have significantly more opportunities to actually have real conversations that can lead to real conversions and real pipeline. The second thing I wanna talk about is that the how is more important than what. And what I mean by this is there's no perfect concoction or perfect recipe for the way to open your cold calls. The most important thing is your tonality and your delivery. So you can take suggestions. You can list it on this and incorporate some of it. You can do a ton of research on your own and pick up tactics or techniques. But if you don't come up with something that you feel confident and comfortable delivering, your prosthetic is never gonna resonate with it. The how is more important than the what. Deliver these with confidence and conviction. Remember, the person you're cold calling do not ask to be cold called. They probably do not wanna talk to you. If you don't sound like you wanna be on that call, how could you expect your prospect to wanna be on that call? The how is critical. Deliver this enthusiasm. Sound like you wanna be there, and your prospect will respond well. The third thing is something I'm a big proponent of, which is called a permission based opener. I think far too often on cold calls, we come off as kind of a symptom. That person doesn't wanna talk to us, and all of a sudden, we're just assuming they're down to hear us out or listen to us pitch. I like my prospect to feel like they are in control of the conversation the entire time, even if that's not necessarily the case. And one of the ways I accomplish this is with a permission based opener. A lot of people use permission openers throughout their cold call. I like to use it really early and really often. And going back to number two, I like to deliver this with extreme conviction. So here's an example. Hey, Nick. This is JC calling with Gong. I'm sure I probably interrupted your day. Can I very, very briefly explain why I'm calling? Hey, Armon. JC here with Gong. Probably a horrible time. Can I have, like, twenty seconds to just explain why I'm interrupting your day? I'm asking permission for the opportunity to explain why I'm calling. That is very different than immediately asking permission to pitch, and I think this is a mission critical part of improving your cold call conversion. Instead of calling somebody, having to pick up and say, can I have forty five seconds to tell you everything about my product? It's, can I have fifteen, twenty seconds to actually explain why I'm specifically calling you as a human being? That is so rare. The vast majority of reps are not doing this. And in my personal anecdotal experience, it has been one of the most black and white needle moving changes I made in my cold call team. And that leads really nicely into section four, which is what I call the three y u. I have no data. I'm once again to back us up. But if I was to throw a dart in the dartboard, I would guess that, like, 90% of reps do not do this. A three y u is three distinct reasons why you are calling them. Instead of them feeling like they're on one massive call list on a 100 VPs of sales or a 100 CFOs, you're actually telling them why you're specifically reaching out to them as a human being, and it flows really nicely after your permission based opener. So it might sound something like this. Hey, Nick. This is JC with Gong. Can I add ten seconds to quickly, quickly explain why I'm specifically calling you? He'll say, sure. Go ahead. I'm going to deliver three crisp, concise, well researched reasons that I'm calling him, and then I'm gonna pause. Hey, Nick. The reason I'm calling you is I noticed you're actively hiring for three new account executives. I also saw your CEO just release a statement saying that you're really focused on enterprise growth. And third, noticed you used to play baseball. I shoved you kinda weird email based on that. Curious, has Gong ever come and crashed your desk before? And that is our call to action. That is our final question. Are you familiar with what we did? That's gonna be the launch point for our cold fall. But you don't get there, and you don't keep a prospect on the phone unless you incorporate all four of these things. So a super, super quick recap. Your cold call opener is mission critical because without a really effective opener, you're never even gonna get people to stay on the phone. The way you deliver your opener is more important than the actual content of your opener. Deliver it with conviction, bring energy and enthusiasm, sound like you wanna be there and your prospect will respond well. Use a permission based opener. Make your prospect feel like they are not obligated to stay on the phone, but that they are actually choosing to speak with you and it'll resonate much better. And then four, launch into your crisp and concise rewind you so that your prospect knows you've taken time to get to know them, and they'll be more open to stay on the phone. That's how I opened that cold calls. That's how I achieved a 48% conversion rate in my final six months as an SDR Gong, and I hope this works for you.
