## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes presence club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sugalski. And we got a back to back Gong special recommended by Sarah Brasier. We have the one and only Adam Ochart, top a e at Gong dot I o, a killer in the disco and in the demo. Nick, why should people listen? Well, Adam kicks us off with some really killer objection handling techniques, but my favorite part about this episode was how DP goes into demo skills. Everything from how to structure your demos, to what content to show, to actually recapping a demo, to figuring out, did you hit your mark with the demo? Three, two, one. Did we hit the mark with the episode? Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Adam, welcome to the show. You know we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. First and foremost, it's expediting your experience. It's gaining more tribal knowledge as a cold caller, and you do that by virtual role play. So getting yourself set up before each call. The second is something that that we coined as the Anaconda Squeeze at Gong. If anyone that's seen Nacho Libre, they'll get that reference. But, essentially, it's objection handling the tactics. It's a way that we've systematized it so that when you get an objection on a call, you're prepared to answer and you're confident. What's the last one? Round us out. The last one is specific to SDRs. It's tracking deals from initial contact to close. So once you hand that meeting off, that's not the end of the tunnel. You gotta follow that all the way through. So when you become an a, you're ready to rock. Alright. So this Anaconda Squeeze thing, I really gotta talk about mostly because I was a college wrestler and Arbonne was my college wrestling training partner, and so I like the Nacho Libre thing. Talk to me about what that framework looks like. You get an objection from a customer. How do you use the framework, and, actually, what comes out of your mouth to the customer? I'm gonna start with, like, a a one minute story to give a little bit of a context here. When I came to Gong, I'd never sold before. I was super excited. I thought I was gonna crush it. I booked three meetings in my first month. You can understand everyone's been there and had a bad month and knows what it feels like. Reviewed some game film with my my manager at the time, a guy named Tanner, and it was pretty evident that I just couldn't handle objections. I think that the playbook told me to continue the pitch feature functionality, and that just dug me deeper into the hole. I'd happen to be reading Chris Voss's book, Never Split the Difference. Anyone that's been in sales has at least heard it, if not read it before. And in line with that, the huge part there is about a lot of mirroring. Right? The psychological effects of mirroring when you're having a conversation. So that in line with a couple of things that I picked up on my calls, I realized that I needed to be more patient. I needed to start to psychologically overcome objections with the tactic like mirroring, and I needed to learn more from a prospect to truly understand the root of that objection so then I could come back and actually come with a a pointed call to action. So what we put together essentially is my way to rebound from that tough month was, what we coined as the anaconda squeeze, but it's three steps. It's pause, mirror, and then ask a loaded question. Talk to me about a loaded question. What does that mean? So the whole point of a loaded question is to, number one, understand well, there's two parts. Understand really what's going on with that objection. Right? Where did that come from? And the secondary part of that is to understand maybe a different angle that you can take. I think that at a fundamental level, typically, objections stem from the fact that that person doesn't believe that you add value to what they're focused in. So the idea is how do we find a different path to value? So mirroring back essentially is your way of saying, I'm listening to you, and I heard what you said. So if you tell me budgets are tied up got it, Nick. It sounds like budgets are tied up. Psychologically, now we've diffused that. Right? They know that they're heard. They know that you're listening. Something that you might wanna come back with from a loaded question perspective is, do you mind telling me a little bit about some of the areas where you've allocated your budget in the past few quarters? Now from Gong's perspective, we're gonna get some insight and from our perspective into what they're focused on. We've added body count. In addition to that, we bought a couple tools to help with pipeline generation. Oh, tell me more about that. Right now we have a string we can pull on and ideally circle back around and come in and and hit them with that specific, call to action on the back end relative to well, given your focus here, I actually think we can help over here. Do you ever get people who are frustrated where it's like, I'm giving you two, three objections, and every time I give you an objection, you don't freaking answer it for me, man. You just, like, mirror me, and then you ask me more questions. And I'm like, dude, I wanna get my question answered. How do you soften it up for your prospects to a certain extent? You know what's funny, Armand, is my assumption when I read Chris Voss's book was that people are gonna tell me to shut up. Right? And to be candid, I actually use the mirroring tactic, like, among my circle of friends with my my beloved girlfriend. She didn't wanna go get food. I would mirror on her hard. And he talks about this in his book. There's a psychological effect of someone mirroring you that it literally breaks down your cognitive focus, and then you all of a sudden wanna, like, from a reciprocity standpoint, get back and contribute to that conversation. As humans, we're psychologically predisposed to wanna be heard and to wanna talk about ourselves. So when I get objections, I tap into that. The level of information that people give you I mean, I've literally I'm not kidding. I've made thousands of calls at Gong. Never had anyone tell me stop asking me questions. So you're mirroring. Are you just repeating back what they just said to you? Or I've read the book also, and I remember him saying something about you repeat the last three words. What's it look like to mirror effectively without parroting? Because I think there's a difference between mirroring and parroting. Right? Yeah. Absolutely. I think inflection is one of the most important parts there. I will say there's a distinction between how I mirror as an AE and and as as an AE that makes cold calls, how I mirror on a cold call. In Chris Voss's book, it's repeating their last few words in an upward inflicting tone. We don't have budget. So you don't have budget? On a cold call, if someone did that to me, Armand, in your point, I would tell them to shut up. Like, yeah. I don't have budget. I just told you I don't have budget. The idea here, it's a closed ended statement, and the sole purpose is to tell them that they're heard. Right? So I'll use a different example. We're not evaluating tools right now. Got it. Okay. So you're definitely you're not evaluating tools right now. And then we move on, and then you go into some sort of open ended question. So, again, it's literally just mirroring what they're saying. And and taking that a step further, if you can mirror their tonality and the way that they deliver that, that takes it a layer further, and it allows you to start to get into their head a little bit and then start being able to pull back more. One thing that I find that Gong does some really good content on is talk to listener ratios and the types of questions you're asking and things like that. But I think oftentimes, one of the things that reps will get caught into is when you talk about handling objections more specifically, you'll get into these q and a battles, right, where you're losing control of the call or things like that. And so after you're handling some objections, how do you start to redirect the call back to your original discovery flow so you maintain control of your call? I think, Armand, that's a good distinction. Right? And and that's why that third part of that Anaconda squeeze is the call to action. Right? It's now let's take all this information you gathered. Let's summarize it in, like, fifteen to twenty seconds and say, given that this is top of mind, I'm truly convinced that we should at least have exploratory conversation. I'm not asking you to enter a buying cycle. I'm just asking for twenty minutes, me and you to sync up. And if it doesn't make sense, then we can part ways as friends. So let's take a step back and let's look at your general discovery flow. And so typically, discovery calls fall into a couple of big buckets within the call. Right? And so first, how do you structure your calls on the high level? Starting with kinda like the obvious basics. Right? There's gonna be that small talk on the front end. I'm a firm believer in building rapport. I also think that the best people nail small talk in two to three minutes and get to the point. Moving forward, there's the obvious agenda. A couple things to state that that we do as a collective at Gong that I've seen be successful is is put the ball in their court as many times as possible, but also maintain control of the conversation. So asking them, hey. Before I propose an agenda, was there anything you needed to get out of our time today? From a discovery perspective, I think you'll start to understand specific things. Like, yeah. I actually really need to get pricing, or I really needed to understand what implementation sounds like. And these things are leading indicators towards how do we start to structure this conversation and actually the discovery I run. Someone that wants pricing or an implementation plan on a first call, like, that to me is a a a much more expedited process than someone that comes in and says, I'm just here to learn. Going into the actual, discussion, I think the most important thing that I try to do and and that we've seen be successful at scale, I mean, we're looking at I've gone with 40 plus, AEs, is zoom out from what they assume our product can help with. And in questioning along the lines of, hey. If you're sitting down with your c suite and you're talking about the next six months in 2020, what are, like, the one, two, and three things that you need to nail? And then from there, like, maybe we can help, maybe we can, but I'd love to start there. And then you continue to drill and find out what's most important to them, what's most important to their bosses. And then from there, you formulate a a more in line questioning that's gonna ideally get to the quote unquote pain funnel that we can then adhere to. Two really important points to call out. The first one is you're asking them what they're hoping to get out of the call, and that's gonna dictate where your disco goes. And then the second piece is you're also starting high level with the key business priorities. And so let's start on the business priorities for a second. How do you ask those questions or how do you get them to talk about their priorities in a way that it's not, well, look, dude. Like, my number one priority is, like, I don't know, fixing my lead routing, but I'm here to talk about conversation analysis. Right? There's a mutual understanding that every solution doesn't solve every problem. Right? So I I'm not opposed to someone telling me that their solution is they need to hire more talent, right, or they need to fill their racks. Right? We're not a recruiting service. So from there, you can say, cool. Based on these specific things, it sounds like from our perspective, we can help the most here. The biggest concern that I always have is we spend a lot of time digging into something and building a business case on a call, and you find out at the end of that call or on a later conversation that, like, yo, that's priority six. Right? Like, we're juggling way too much, and that'll never get budget cleared up. Awesome. And so from there, you're getting me to list out my main priorities. Right? And so from there, I give you a couple different priorities. Are you then going to drill into one of them and then go deep and wide there? So I think that if there's something that I know we can nail, I'll drill in. I'm personally I I use Sandler methodology. Before I dig in too deep, I'm gonna ask some specific pointed questions. I wanna know how they've tried to solve this in the past, how long has it been a priority, and who else is focused on this. Those are three ways to kinda navigate understanding is this actually something that's important as opposed to asking how important is this and coming off as a salesperson. The next point is the way that your pitch is structured should typically in line with your value prop and should actually have a few different avenues. So from there, I'll go in and pitch our elevator pitch per se or our small slide deck. And I'm I'm probably trying to lead them towards a specific area. I'm gonna tie it back to what I learned. But then again, I give them another opportunity based on these specific areas. Right? We have twenty minutes to dive into a demo. What do you need to nail? If there's a misalignment between what they told me before and there, well, then I have to start getting creative and finding out what's really important. 95% of the time, it's gonna align with what we ran in discovery, and that's kind of a a final redundancy on me making sure I'm actually moving in the right direction. I love the thing you're doing where you keeps almost ceding control to the customer. It's really nuanced what you're doing. But at the beginning of that discovery call, instead of you laying out the agenda and then saying, hey. Is there anything you wanna add to the agenda? You're actually starting and saying, is there anything in particular we have to go over today before I propose the agenda? It's just a little flip, but what it does is now your agenda is not clouding or biasing, like, the things that they say. Because if you propose the agenda yourself, someone who's, like, kind of $50.50 invested is gonna be like, yeah. That's fine. Let's just do that. But if you ask them first, now they've gotta actually think. And that's that's a challenge we deal with with customers sometimes. It's getting them to truly, truly engage when they're meeting with 18 different vendors in a week. Actually, make them think, what do I wanna learn from this guy today? So you're doing this in the demo also. Are there other times that you're you're seeding or turning over control of the customer where it's like, look, you take the reins and you tell me what we have to do here, and then I'll tell you the best way to get there. Yeah. I mean, there's two distinct times that I that I strategically roll this out. And and, I mean, I'm sure every sales rep says this at some point, but it's like, I feel almost guilty talking about this because I've learned it from my peers. Right? And I've been lucky enough to listen to them on the lines and talk through this. One of the the more strategic places that it's it's, outlined is in the actual agenda itself. So I think that there's a a concern with running discovery and specifically when you're at a really high level. So I I don't I don't ask this questioning when I'm at, like, a a, you know, manager level or director level even, but when I'm at a VP or a c level, I typically tell them, hey. Typically, on these conversations, there's two components that are gonna be helpful. There's gonna be that elevator pitch, and then there's gonna be a little bit of discovery. I'm happy to start with the elevator pitch if you'd prefer that. But if you're happy to run a little bit of mutual discovery, we can do that, and I'll tailor my pitch on the back end. Which do you prefer? And I think that as a a VP or a CRO, number one, they feel in charge. You've given them the opportunity. And here's the thing, both of those situations equal them giving you commitment that they're gonna let you run discovery on them. So they're kinda, like, backed into a corner. That I heard right when I became an e. I rolled it out, and it's just, like, so successful in terms of that disco flow. Let's say you show them the slide deck. Where do you take it from there? Like, how do you drive your next line of questioning after that? Yep. So it's similar how I told you in our slide deck. Right? We have a few different paths. Well, based on that, I talk about, hey. With these three specific value props that we highlighted here, I'm curious which one resonates the most. And from there, they're gonna drill in, and I'm gonna ask a couple more questions. Right? Because I think a lot of people will choose kind of the easy option. Got it. Well well, I'm curious what you know, why did that resonate? Did something stand out? And from there, you dig into that, and then you go into saying, hey. I mentioned that the two parts of this was gonna be a little mutual discovery. I'd love to unlearn a little bit more about that. Do you mind unpacking that elaborating? And then from there, you do if you're a challenger guy, you do your route. If you're a Sandler guy, you go down the funnel, so on and so forth. I'm kinda curious about the way that you are carrying this over to a demonstration with a customer because we haven't spent a lot of time on demo skills on this show, but I think it's an area that's really underrated in sales reps. So do you have any best practices when it comes to giving a demo to a customer? Yeah. I I I think for starters, it's kind of in line with my entire philosophy and style. One of the things that I wanna know, and you can't always ask it directly, but how do people learn? Right? And I think that I'll ask people, like, hey. I'm gonna walk you through some basics. I'm gonna talk about some of the tech side of things, you know, how we're integrating, how we're doing this and that. And then I wanna walk you through a few workflows that I know will be relevant based on what we talked about. Would it be most helpful with you if we walk through and kinda clicked around? Or are you someone that more or less just kinda wants to see the main pages, understand the dashboards? And from there, we can drill in. Again, Nick, I mean, you're starting to spot a trend. Right? I'm gonna let them kinda guide me. And then, you know what's funny? At times, people are bullish and say, Adam, I'm done. Just show me the platform, and that's fine. Like, that's cool. They asked for it. Right? I'm gonna still pepper in some discovery. I'm gonna show them a few different things. So you're talking about peppering discovery. What does that look like on a demo? Are you just pausing every ten minutes and saying, any questions? Or did that make sense? It's a death trap, and I learned that early and often. I think knowing the ins and outs of each of your platforms and whoever's listening to this, the platforms that they have, there are ways in which you should be able to solve problems that they have that they're not doing today. Right? I think, like, that that whole point of discovery is where are you today, where do you wanna go, how How long is that road? Let me show you how short it is with our product. Right? Some of the questions you can start to answer is, hey. I feel like this is in line with when you talk about decreasing your ramp. This will be really impactful. This is exactly how we've helped teams like a, b, and c. From your world, do you have anything similar to this rolled out? Or have you tried to solve something similar to this? And then again, it's kinda like rekindling that pain funnel, starting them to think, like, okay. You know what? I don't have anything like this. Or alternatively, yeah. No. We've done this, this, and that, and it hasn't been successful. So it's kind of a win win from there. Another question I have around the demo is, let's say you had a call with Arman. He's the director of sales. They're thinking about rolling out Gong, and you've gotten three use cases that you know you can solve for. Maybe he's focused on ramp time. He's focused on getting better market intelligence around competitors, and he also wants to help coach his reps better. How do you decide how you order and stack things in the demo? And when do you know when enough is enough? You've shown enough of a certain feature. The way that I would stack rank those is dependent on two things based on what they talked about being the most important and the specific feature that in lines with our ability to present the biggest wow factor. If it's a competitive deal, right, there's there's something unique in as a competitive advantage, and we're lucky at Gong to be poised in the position we are to show different things. So from that perspective, I mean, you wanna essentially have, like, jab, jab, jab, and then come with a haymaker. Right? And if you can have that kind of, effect, that's the most important thing. In a perfect world, you align that haymaker with the thing that's most important to them. I'm also not afraid to tell someone, like, hey. I know that these are the three things you're focused on. Personally, I think the best use of our time to really drill into this, and then I'm happy to set up more time on the back end if we need to to talk about these things and set up a separate meeting. That's where I go. I'd rather have one use case nailed down than three diluted use cases. How about, like, common demo pitfalls? Are there times when you've got a group, there's two or three people, and you've got the skeptic in the corner who doesn't believe that this thing is really doing what it can, or you've got the person with a million and a half questions, and they want you to see you click that button and that button and that button. How do you make sure your demos stay on track when you're giving them? I think it's funny you use the example of, like, the person that wants to click everything. There's two points to that. The approach that I have, which is, like, giving them a lot of authority to start to make decisions and choose where things are going, has its pitfall, and that is that you give people the opportunity to start to interject and disrupt your flows. I think that the reason it works for my personality type is I'm someone that that can kinda flip the switch, regain control, and start to become aggressive. Right? It's also part of setting a really good agenda. Right? If you set a succinct agenda, you can say, hey. I I know there's a lot we can unpack here. At the end of the day, as I mentioned in the agenda, right, we have a lot to cover in a short period of time. I'm happy to field questions afterwards or via email. So you wanna make sure that you do that. And then, like, the overarching pitfall and something that I I'd love to get data on, I have a theory that the more you click in a demo, the less effective that demo is. I've always said the less pages you can show and the less dashboards you can flash, the better. You should show two or three things that when they close their eyes at night, they're just like, oh, man. I I remember that. I forget what that was like. And this happened to me very recently. I got on a second call with a decision maker. Guys, like, dude, you nailed it. I haven't stopped thinking about like that. And it was something that wasn't even that crazy, but it was I knew it would resonate. Well, it's amazing. We spend all day every day in our software, and you might show four demos a day to different decision makers. And so you've seen your thing a million and a half times. But when you get on with the VP of sales who's never seen Gong, that's the first time that they're seeing it, and it's the first time they're trying to digest it. And sometimes we make the mistake as reps where we try to show everything, and it overwhelms them, and you actually make the software seem more complicated than it actually is. So when you think about keeping it simple, that oftentimes works to next point with a VP of sales. You don't wanna bring them into the depths of the software. But you guys sell an interesting solution where your reps are really the business users, and they're focused on looking at their calls, but then the managers have a different view, and then the VPs of sales have a different view. And then on top of that, you've got sales ops who also has to make purchasing decisions and do all the integrations. And so when you think about demoing those different audiences, one, are you trying to do all those in the same meeting? Or two, like, how do you cut up and change your demo for each of those audiences? Not only is it a different focus, there's different business goals, there are different personality types. Right? You have an AE that's like, you're taking my time off the floor. Right? You got a sales ops person that's, like, how does this integrate with Salesforce? What does it do for me without me doing anything? Right? There's just, like, so many different personas for navigating. I think the most important thing well, number one, in a perfect scenario, I break all of those conversations. I break them down. I just say, hey, hey, everyone. I'm happy to meet all of you at this time. In reality, Albert and sales ops are gonna have a few different questions than Armand, the sales manager. I'm happy to meet the VP and the and the managers together, but we should have this operations conversation separately. And I always say, hey. My biggest concern is there's a lot of different parties in the room right now. There's a lot of different focuses. I wanna answer all your questions, but we genuinely won't have enough time. So my ask to you is if you have questions that are more pointed, jot them down, send me an email, and I'm even happy to spend time with each of you separately. What I wanna make sure is we check all these boxes and hit everything before the end of our forty five minute presentation. And so we've gone through agenda. We've gone through at the core of the disco, we've even gone through demo. Let's say it's all done. Right? You've shown them all the stuff. You hit a couple. You hit them with the haymaker at the end of the demo, and now you stop showing software. How do you start to wrap this whole thing up with some next steps and get yourself closer to closing the deal? Yep. So there's two points. I think number one is always do a pulse check. Right? And and I use the the simple language of zero being I wouldn't use it if it was free. 10 being I wish I had this ten years ago. Right? And I think that that's, like, really easy language. So that's what I do. So pulse check at the end of it. Right? And I think that people will respect that. And I think you you give them the right to be candidly honest and tell them, like, hey. I I wanna be on the exact same page as you, so feel free to be blunt. And then the second part is, again, I always tell them, hey. I have an idea for what next steps look like, but I wanna put the ball in your court. And the reason I do that is a lot of times, they will give me a lot of intelligence around their buying process when I say that. My next step would be, hey. Let's set up a pilot. Let's get a couple stakeholders in the room, so on and so forth. And I interject steps in the buying process that they didn't have. Right? What if someone wanted to buy without a pilot? So when I say that, someone will say, cool. Let me just pick my CFO and see if we can get approved for this. And if we can, you can send an order. When I was about to just inject a bunch of steps and next steps. Right? So, again, hey. Before I propose next steps, I have a couple ideas on ways we could take this. But I'd love to hear from you. What do you think would be the best place to take this? And it's surprising. They'll guide you down that path. So I think I'm going back a couple points on this. I know Gong is not the cheapest solution on the market. Right? You guys are the premium on the market. You guys are the BMW. People are gonna pay more for Gong. And so how do you think about changing the way you do discovery, or how do you think about asking different discovery questions or holding the line when you're in a competitive price war with a rip and replace type of battle? With anything in sales, it's not won or lost in that moment. Right? It's won or lost in how do you how you built value and how you delivered from, like, the first time you made made contact all the way on. If you find yourself in a pricing war at any time, you're probably screwed. Right? You can't be better unless you're different. So you have to be a different solution. You have to be more aligned with what they're focused on. And I think before you start to go into any sort of, like, battle, you have to just make sure, like, hey. Are we agreed that we're we're better here? We're who you want, and then we'll be able to work together there. In a perfect world, do they agree? They typically don't. It's just the way that it is. And then it gets into, like, the nitty gritty boxing match or so on and so forth. Here we go. We talked about a lot of good habits. We hit discovery calls cradle to grave. Agendas, everything from disco, demo, next steps, but we haven't talked about some of the bad habits. And so if there was one bad habit to break for every rep out there, what would it be? I think knowing the people I know, talking to sales reps, living the life of an AE and and an SDR, I think it's overthinking. I think it is paralysis by overanalysis. Right? And I think that we think way too much about that email we're gonna send, way too much about how we're gonna overcome a specific objection. When if you can be present, you can be in the moment, you know your product, you know your value prop, and you just be yourself and you have a conversation, that's gonna net you better results. It's also gonna save you a ton of time and make you what much more, efficient as a person. Anything else you wanna leave with the audience before we jump? No. I mean, I think that, that's it, man. This is great. This is fun. Everybody, go buy some Gong from Adam and hang on for a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Your top four takeaways from the episode with Adam Ochart include number one, mirror the objection, then ask a loaded question for the squeeze. Number two, use slides not to pitch your product, but to give prospects control over what they wanna talk about for the rest of the call. Number three, when you're dealing with VPs of sales or CROs, that c suite, ask them upfront before the demo if they're the type that wants to see everything or if they just want the high level. That way, you don't bring them into the depths if you don't need to. And then number four, upfront, especially when you're dealing with a room of eight people, you've gotta tell them your biggest concern. And in that big of a room, your biggest concern is you don't wanna get stuck in the demo and in the tactical weeds. And so that'll help you keep tactical questions to a minimum, and then you can handle them offline. Nick, how can people help us? Well, Arman, I don't know about you, but I'm always really flattered when I get some love on LinkedIn. But this week, let's spread it to some other people. Sarah last week, Adam this week, they had some killer episodes. So go on LinkedIn, show them some love, and thank them for coming on thirty minutes to present this club. And with that, we'll see you all next week.
