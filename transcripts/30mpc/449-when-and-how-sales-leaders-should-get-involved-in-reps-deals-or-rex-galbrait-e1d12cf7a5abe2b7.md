## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to Presidents' Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my host, Marc Kosiglio. And today, we have someone who has a way that if you score a deal over a 40 momentum score, it means that your deal is likely to have a 70 plus percent win rate. And he broke down exactly how to build a momentum score framework in this episode. His name is Rex. He is the CRO over at Consensus. Mark, why should people listen? I think that Rex has kinda figured it out. He's realized that the major change in sales over the last few years as we've gone from seller centric to buyer centric environment, and I think he's tuned his sales org to what the buyers need to do rather than what the sellers need to be doing. And three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, Rex. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. K. Number one, I would say time box, Slack, and email beyond the first hour. So one of the things that I've made a huge mistake on is right when I wake up, I pick up my phone, and I let Slack and email dictate my day. Days that start that way end up not being as productive. So what I would say is exercise and show how much discipline you have by waiting and making sure that you've prioritized your day. Most people don't 90% of people will not write down or document what they're gonna do in that day. They let the email and Slack dictate it. What I've done for at least the last year, I try to wake up every morning and refrain from that and get myself in the right state of mind and make sure that I'm working on the 20% of things that are gonna move the needle 80%. You know, I'm tempted to ask about it now, but I'm gonna time block that to after your third takeaway. So what's number two? Perfect. The second is what a lot of people call Ohio, only handle it once. This is a very small thing that makes a huge impact. A lot of times when it comes to sell cycles, days can be the difference between losing a deal and winning a deal. I'll give you two examples of how you handle something once. Number one is when it comes to proposals. When you counter, you always counter with something that is executable. And when they counter offer, you tell them that they have to send something that is executable as well. That's the only thing you'll take back to leadership and finance. That removes cycles in between the negotiation phase. The second is just scheduling a little meeting. I can't tell you how many times I've gone through calls and I've looked through sales cycles and seen that it's just days before people can get something on the calendar. One thing you can do that's very easy is when you send an invite out, just send a time that you think works and tell them that you have the right to change that any way you want. Just give them your self scheduling link and tell them they can even send times at work, but remove back and forth. Make it your scheduling a one email transaction, and you'll save yourself a few days on every single deal cycle. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. What's number three? Number three is modifying your sales stages to be based on buyer actions. Seller actions are yards. Buyer actions are points on the scoreboard. Yards will never win you points. It's only getting in the end zone. So what the buyer does matter. So you have to go into your sales stages and look and make sure that no stage can be progressed to unless a buyer has taken a certain action. And that's gonna take some planning. You're gonna have to look at the actions that make the most impact. But once you find out what are the five, six, seven actions that a buyer takes that lets you know that they've moved forward, make those requirements. The seller actions are only bonuses. Seller actions do not represent points or ARR on the board. What the buyer does matters most above everything else. Did you give that vendor review example to finish it off? Vendor review It was like a deal doesn't move into this stage until an economic buyer is brought into the sales. Like, it was the same example you gave, in the prep. Yes. Another thing to think about too is that who takes the action matters. So for example, when you move into verbal, just because a champion says the deal's gonna happen, you have to decide which type of person. So if you're a Medpick organization, you have to decide what an economic buyer is, and it has to be tracked in the system. And some type of document or some type of call that can be attributed that would prove that you moved into that stage. And then at that point, it's measurable, and everything going into verbal have very similar close rates and motions because it is measurable. Rex, we've definitely moved into a new environment of sales in the last year or two. And I think one of the things that I really identified with that you just talked about was seller activity is really kinda meaningless if you don't have reciprocal buyer activity that moves the deal forward. And at the law, the point of diminishing return has lowered so far on sales activity that, you know, back in the day, seven, eight years ago, we could just do more, more, more, get more, more revenue. Now if we do more, more, more, we actually turn buyers off. We get less revenue. So you have this kind of concept called momentum, which I think is a really cool idea of how to understand if a deal is working well rather than looking back and being like, well, we sent 18 emails and had 14 phone calls, and you sent 17 texts. We must be really rocking in this deal. That activity no longer helps us that much. So help me understand what momentum is and how you track Yeah. So this is something I give a lot of credit to our rev ops team. Matt Bauer and Jacob Blandi on our team really ops. By the way, if you don't have a rev ops function and you can get one, it's life changing in terms of how you run your business. The way that I used to run sales when I was new trying to figure things out, I used to think measure how many calls it takes to get to a certain stage or how many proposals have to go out. And it was everything based on what we did. We flipped the script on this because the data showed us that what we do had a much less impact on what the deal did than what the buyer did. And so what we created was something called the momentum score. And what it did is it measured seven to 10 of the key buyer actions that we saw move the deal more than anything else. And what we did is we just created a score. It wasn't perfect at first. We kinda made it up as we went. But as we started building it, it started shaping itself, and more action started to come forward. And what we learned is that the score ranged somewhere between zero and a 100, that when our scores reached 40, the close rate was 70%. And so what we saw is we started seeing incongruency between what some reps would say the deal's stage was in. So it's a verbal, which is normally an 85, 90% close rate for us, but then their momentum was lower. Momentum won out almost every single time. And so what we were able to do is when we went on one on ones, we'd say, why does our momentum score project this and you project that? And it created coaching moments that you could say, let's go look at that. And sometimes, if it was wrong, we could tweak the model. But the main thing is when you're growing your organization when I was smaller, I knew every deal, and it's hard not to know every deal. Now it's hard to see a deal come through and be like, man, I could have been a part of that. And that's something that you have to do as a leader. So as you manage it, you have to be more data centric, and you have to be able to know what are the actions that are moving the needle. And this momentum score is a great way to do it. The fundamentals are measure it based on buyer actions. So I love this. Can you give me some examples of those seven to 10 buyer actions that are in your score? Like, if I wanted to create this, like, what would I what have you learned are the top ones that we need to have in there? Yeah. Like, how do you even calculate your momentum score? Yeah. So because of the product that we use, we send a demo. If the demo's watched, we've learned that there's a 34% likelihood that they'll show to the first meeting. Mhmm. So and if they share it, it goes to 81. So from an SDR to an AE, our SDRs are constantly trying to get them to watch the demo before the first meeting. So it's a little trailer because the show rate is higher and also the likelihood of another stakeholder joining increases because they start sharing it and people want so that's one example. Another example is who says yes when it comes to a verbal. And normally, because we have sales ears as a salesperson, if you're not disciplined, any yes, you will mark up as a verbal. And what we've learned is is we use MEDDPIC. An economic buyer is someone who has the authority to run a budget and and make a budgeting decision. And until that is proven, we will not move something into verbal. And so those are the two buyer actions that we calculate into our scoring. So this is really good. Could you give a couple of more? And then I wanna talk about if I wanted to build this on my own. But, like, number one is demo watch and share. So that's something really early in the sales cycle. Something later in the sales cycle is who says yes to a verbal. So it's not like an analyst saying yes to a verbal. It's probably someone with a VP or a c something in their title. Are there one or two other variables that you find that are pretty common in sales organizations that you should put in your momentum score? The one I would say is kind of like a that I see consistent across every organization is the frequency of communication. If there is a cadence of communication and that dips, that is almost always a bad sign. One of the things you have to watch for when it goes into our momentum score is if the cadence of communication changes at any moment. And so you have to look at how frequent. I can almost tell you the health of a deal, and I don't even have to read the emails. If I go through the activity and I just see things slowing down, companies, when they get closer to close, the activity tends to ramp up. Mhmm. Discussions keep going. More calls keep happening. If you're the one dragging your champion into calls, you should be the first one worried, and you should directly talk to your champion and say, I'm worried. Our data shows that that and our experience shows that our our cadence of communication increases. I'm seeing it slow down. Is this something we should be worried about? And a lot of times, they'll either be like, you know what? Something happened. Or they may give you a good excuse of, like, someone went on a vacation. But you should be the first one worried, if you see the communication drop at all. And that would be email flow, meeting flow, all of that kind of stuff. Right? Not just, hey. Are we having a meeting every two weeks? We're looking at, like, several factors inside there. Yes. If you're the one that's pushing the communication at the end, there's probably a problem if you're pushing it too much. When companies are excited and you've convinced them that you're a game changing product, their interest level tip and that's what we saw in our buyer actions is deals that closed, buyer activity went up in terms of calls, emails. Deals that were lost in the tail end, it's staggering. You can see the dots are there's no middle ground. It it either goes up or it goes down. And if it goes down, we call it our early warning system. Our CRM will ping you, and we're getting better at it. It will ping you and tell you a red flag has come up that would tell us that this deal is not in the shape that it was maybe a week ago. So, Rex, I'm curious. We've got three or four different signals, but they're not the traditional MEDDPIC ones that I would have expected where it's like metrics or economic it's like watch and share the demo. It's like frequency and cadence of communication. And if I'm a sales leader and I'm trying to build a momentum score for my organization, It sounds like you've got seven to 10 of these different factors. How did you figure out that these were the seven to 10 predictive factors and not other parts of MEDDPIC, for example? Or why not just use MEDDPIC as your predictive factors? MEDDPIC was the beginning, but what we learned is that not all companies are the same and not all cycles are the same and not all buyers are the same. What I would say is you just need to start. And so the first thing I'd say is pull up your LucidChart or your Miro board or whatever it is and go go get your top AEs, your top CSMs, go get your rev ops person to kinda put some data and just say, hey. Everyone, I want you to tell me what actions have you seen that are unmistakable signs towards a deal moving forward and signs that a deal is moving backwards? And so those are gonna be the red flags and the white flags. And then you create those, and then the next step is once you've determined and I keep it short. I wouldn't make it too complex. Maybe five to 10 to start out. Then you grade them. So create a 100% scoring system and have everybody vote what percent. Take the average of that. And then as the leader, if you've been there for a long time, you can be a little bit more judicious how you wanna move it. But kind of get a feel. And then run it. And then you can run it retroactively and see how accurate it was. So go look at previous deals and see when I ran the score, did high scores yield a higher close rate and did low? And if it that is, then you got something, and then you just keep building on it. So step one, brainstorm. Figure out those things. Number two, score it. Three, run it. And then let your rev ops team go to work or your operational minded person go to work, and then start putting together something that's actually measurable, someone who knows statistics and how to really do it at scale. And make sure you're getting the feeling out of it. And me, I'm a feeling CRO naturally. And if you're one of those, you gotta be very careful and have someone with you that can kick you off that feeling train and get you on the data train when you're going through this exercise. The, give me, like, what this means. You just said if it's over 40 of a 70% win rate, like, how often do people get to 40? Is that, like, something that they feel like they can control, or is it just an observation? And then, like, tell me, like, the juxtaposition. Like, if it's 10, what is the win rate? Yeah. So we have four major categories. We have a 10, an 18, a 29, and a 40 score. A 10 is a 13% close rate. An 18 is a 20% close rate. A 29 is a 40%. And you just get up to that 40 mark, and it quickly starts going in the right direction. So what it does is it helps you focus. You know, one of the tips that I shared was time boxing and making sure that you do the right things. If the buyer behavior isn't where it needs to be, get out of your normal motion of following what you do every day. You keep making actions until the behaviors that need to happen. And normally, I think we've been programmed because we've seen it in CRMs that stages look like SQL and it looks like exploration. We're programmed to think that we're making progress if it moves along traditional stages. The world has changed where the buyer is in control now. They choose the way that they want to engage. And so you need to focus on the playbooks that will move the buyer behavior. I was just gonna ask, we have this delta. Right? So you you talk about these coaching moments. Alright. I'm committing this, which means and, you know, I'm gonna close it. But then we go look at the momentum score and it's below 29, which means we know we have a, you know, less than a 30% chance to win the deal. So give me an idea of, like, what that conversation looks like. And, like, what is the direct coaching that you can give a rep to help them understand how to get that momentum score up and increase their ability to win the deal? So Dan Hickson is our VP of sales that I work with, and he does an amazing job at and a lot of this is his brainchild. We have a one on one dashboard. And right towards the top of it is the momentum score. We look at it every single week. In the one on ones, we look at where they're at in the stage and if the momentum score is moving. The one thing that you can get advanced at is, eventually, over time, you can show momentum how it's trending. So when we first did it, it was just what was the momentum at a moment in time. So a 29 momentum score at stage two is pretty good. When you're getting to the late stages and you've been in cycle for a hundred and twenty days, that's not a good score. That means it's in a bad spot. So timing is a big piece. So in the one on one, when the stage is late and and the momentum is low, we would say, we need to go do a deep dive into this account. And that's where we start breaking out the visual maps and looking and figuring out. And that's where we get involved. If everything is aligned, we kinda let that go and we guide as we so we're watching for we don't just go from deal one to deal two or biggest deal to smallest deal. We go to the deals that aren't in line with the data and the momentum score. Because, you know, you're working, let's say, a million dollar deal, but if everything's going as planned, let the rep cook. Right? If if it's a big deal, but what they're feeling and what their stage is saying is different than momentum score, that's where your coaching comes in. You have to pick your coaching moments. You can't coach every deal every time, and the rep has to show some autonomy. Your job is to help give them that advice when the data and the stage don't line up. Rex, one thing that I think would be helpful is so you're CRO over at ConsenSys. You have a VP of sales as well. I'm curious, like, at each level from, like, manager to director to VP to you, like, what deals are each level involved? Because my guess is there are probably at least a couple of deals you're still involved in, like, the really, really, really key ones. But, like, how do you make sure you're not stepping on your VP's toes? How do you make sure your VP isn't stepping on your director's toes? And, like, all of that. What does that look like at each level? So this is a very difficult one that took us time. I've been with ConsenSys for nine years. I came in as a VP. The company shrunk three times, and I became a VP with a title, but I was basically an AE. I had to rebuild it back up, and then eventually hired another rep. And and then we got a team and everything. My default position is to get involved with deals. That's where I like to be. That's where my natural state is. So there is some there is some times where there's some bumping into one another. I would say when it comes to when we get involved, it's really based on kind of our negotiation playbook. I'm a big fan of leveling. If you're gonna bring a decision maker to the table, they better be bringing a decision maker to the table. If you reveal your CEO or your CFO at the wrong time, you will shoot yourself in the foot. We actually have this concept that I integrated called the three rings. I believe that every single deal will ring the negotiation towel at least three times. Your champion will, the procurement will, and the final signer will. And you have to have enough juice in that towel for every ring, because each one has to come out a winner. And you have to have three levels. So think about the walls. The first wall breaks, the second, the third, and then you have to kind of end where you need to be. And so that is something that we talk about all the time is make sure you build your proposals to withstand three rings and make sure that you layer in the leadership at the right time. If you think that the champion's negotiation is the one that's gonna be pen to paper, it will not because everybody has to show their contribution to it. And it's typically three rings, and that's the champion, procurement, and the signer. So if I'm a rep and I'm thinking, I've gotta bring in someone in on a deal. Right? How does your rep know if they should bring in their manager, their VP, or possibly bring you in? Because they're probably not bringing in the whole chain of command. It sounds like matching power with power is the main way that you're doing that, where, like, if they're bringing in a c level at an enterprise account, we're bringing in Rex. Is that how you're doing it, or are there other things that I should think about? Yeah. It's the same thing with referrals. Like, don't bring in your referral when someone's just kind of evaluate. They have to be literally ready to sign on the line pending some type of bad referral or reference. So, yes, what I would say is, it's only fair that if you wanna move up into, you know, the director manager level is that that's kind of how we'll return it in kind. And then one of the things that we always try to do that if you're gonna bring a decision maker on from our side that actually has budget control, they should be doing the same. And so it's kind of nuanced in that way. But what I've learned is if you bring somebody in too early, the three rings have to happen. And if you get to your three rings before they get to theirs, then you're in a bad spot. Yeah. We would often take I gotta line those up. Our CEO would, I was early stage selling at a company called Pave. And sometimes we would make the mistake of bringing our CEO into a negotiation with, like, a champion. And you can't let your CEO be at the first ring because, one, they're gonna give everything away for free. And then, two, you can't build up the big boss. Right? You need to be able to build up the big boss and be like, that's to your point of only doing something once. When you say, like, hey, I'm gonna bring in my CEO or my CRO to, like, finalize this agreement. There is some, like, epic finality of bringing in the big boss. But if that person's been there the entire time, it's like, oh, you're gonna go see Rex for the seventeenth time in the sales cycle. But this time, he really means business. I promise. It doesn't have the same weight to it if they've been there the whole time. Yeah. It's a because you can do this backwards too. You bring on too early, you bring on too late. I have reps whose personalities is like, I wanna go out, hunt it, kill it, bring it back, and cook it myself, and that can be a huge mistake. I also have people who, like, I wanna get any executive at any moment into the meeting. And I would say, if you're an early deal cycle and they say, hey. I can get you the CRO right now, You shouldn't jump on that right away. If things are not in play if if a top leader comes in and doesn't feel like this is mature enough, you may shoot yourself in the foot. So you have to do things in their proper order. I remember when we were first starting at consensus and we didn't have great secure you know, we weren't SOC two compliant. And I used to say, man, I hope they don't ask. I hope that I'm not gonna bring the call up. I'm not gonna bring it up. I'm just gonna hope they sign it. They never did. And so what I learned is that you be bold enough and you bring it up first. If you start going to your champions and you're bringing up objections before they do, they will trust you. If you try to hide objections, they will always think twice. And so when it comes to objections and deal cycles, that's a big deal. And the same thing with bringing people in. Timing matters. Just because you can get a high level executive on a call on either side does not mean that you should. You need to know and document what is the role I play. I always tell the team, you're the quarterback. I'm not running this deal. You are running it. You tell me the play that I'm gonna run. And because they think higher title means quarterback, and I'm like, no. No. No. You tell me the role I play. Am I a bad cop? Am I a good cop? Am I supposed to just kinda show that we're gonna drive support? Am I negotiating? I can't tell me how many times I've been on calls where they're just like, k. Rex is here. He's gonna just figure this out, and then I look like an idiot. And and so me as a leader, you should have prep calls where you have a game plan and you've mapped out where this is gonna go and you know whose role is gonna be what. And write those down. Write down what are those roles? What is the role that each person's gonna play? And if you put the prep in, the call will go much better. So I've got one last question for you, which is we've talked about everything from you were in the earlier days, you're basically acting as an AE. You've got this, like, higher level management deal to deal where you've got your momentum score. You don't check Slack or email on the first day. Sometimes you get involved in key deals. There are a million different things that you could be doing as a CRO on any given day. And I know it's obviously going to vary whether it's end of quarter, board meeting, not, etcetera. But, like, do you have some framework for how a senior revenue leader should be spending their day, whether it's deep work in the morning or something like that? What would, like, an example day of projects, deals, and all of that stuff look like in your world? So if there's one thing that you could learn from what we talked about today, there's a book called Procrastinate on Purpose. It's written by Rory Vaden. I've never met him. If he listens to this podcast, I'd love to meet you. He has some really good information. But what the main takeaway is is that there's no such thing as time management. Time will move the way it moves no matter what you do. What you do is insignificant in terms of how time moves. There is self management that will make it feel like you're multiplying your time. There's a concept in the book called the focus funnel. And at the top of the focus funnel, there is eliminate. So you take all your major tasks. I do this at least once a year. And I say, what can I eliminate? Do I still need to do that? Do I still need to put napkins in the break room for my startup? Probably not. If you can eliminate it, the next phase is can you automate it? And we live in a day of automation. There's a lot you can automate. We live in the day of AI, which can automate a ton. And then the next is can you delegate it? Can you actually and should you delegate it? If it makes it through all three, there's two choices. You can procrastinate it. Should I actually do this right now? And if not, then schedule it for another time. If you have to do it, what you'll realize is most of the stuff you're working on will not make it to your list of what you need to do right now. So at our business, we do something called an impact tracker. All the leadership does it. It's the three to five outcomes that you need to have that week that will change the company's trajectory. We hold each other accountable that every single week. And I'd run some of those activities through eliminate, automate, delegate. If if you get a chance, you can Google it. Just put focus funnel. It will show you what it looks like. Go through the exit. I've done this in my own personal life, and I started automating bill pay. I started delegating these things. I started eliminating things I shouldn't be doing. I started unsubscribing to things. I have to delete them every time, And it applies to every part of your life from business to just your day to day to your kids' schedules to your spouse's schedules to your significant other's schedules. The focus funnel is huge. We live in a very fast paced world, and if you don't manage it, the things that don't matter tend to take over. Dude, amazing show. We have to move to the final question. And we talked about one great habit there, a ton of other really good habits. But what is one bad habit that every sales leader should break so that all sales teams can get a little bit better? Bad habit that you need to break is to get over yourself that you think that you can affect the deal. The buyer's actions affect the deal more than anything. The t shirt that says I close deals doesn't apply today. You don't close anything. The buyer does. If you can just make that shift to say, I am the tour guide to the purchase. My job is to help them. So just like a coach isn't the one that's putting the ball into the basket, that's the role that you play as the seller. Your buyers are the ones that are going through all the actions. The data shows that over 83% of what happens in a purchase happens without you present. So you need to coach up your champions. You need to be there for them because what you do at the end of the day will have little significance if a deal closes or not. It has everything to do with what they do. Rex, amazing show. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Mark. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Rex from Consensus. What do you have for your two? Great reminder. Don't check Slack and email right when you wake up, and definitely don't check it right before you go to bed. I got a Slack, like, three nights ago, and I didn't sleep because I shouldn't have read it. It didn't need me to read it at that time. It screwed up my whole night. So, like, listen, good reminder. Don't get on Slack and stuff before you kinda get through your morning routine of what you need to do that day. And then secondly, buyer action is greater than seller action. And our job as sellers is to get buyers to act, not to just do activity for activity's sake so that we can say we sent 17 emails in the last two weeks. And so I think that, you know, that part of his talk track of how he really thinks that buyers actions are touchdowns and seller actions are yards, I thought was really good. Number three, the momentum score. So you wanna come up with the seven to 10 variables that impact your deal the most. For example, in Rex's case, if someone watched the demo before the first discovery call, that's some points. If a specific e b said yes to a verbal, that's more points than just champion. Add it up and just start iterating and figuring out what are the most predictive elements of what gets your deals over the line. So that's number three. And then number four is your deal has to survive the three rings of the towel. Ring number one is the champion's gonna want a piece. Ring number two is the procurement is gonna want a piece. And then ring number three is the final signer is gonna want a piece. So you gotta make sure that you have enough rings on your side. So don't bring your CEO on the first call if that's the first negotiation cut. Alrighty, Mark. One thing that people can do is ConsentCentrix actually put out a really, really good report that showed you, like, six things that you can do in your demo to massively increase your win rates, and it's a really good follow-up resource to this. I'm gonna put that down in the show notes. And, folks, we will see you on the next one. Later.
