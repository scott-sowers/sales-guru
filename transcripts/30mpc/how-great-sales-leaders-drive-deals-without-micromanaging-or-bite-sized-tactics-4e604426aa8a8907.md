## Transcript

No surprises and good vibes. I wanna make sure that my team knows exactly how I feel, what's going on in the in the company, what to expect, good, bad, ugly, or otherwise. It goes both ways. I'll give an example. One of my reps, just last week had forecasted a deal that I ended up taking out of my forecast, and I shared that back with the entire team and explained why. You know, we didn't have an executive alignment. We weren't getting visibility onto when the contract would be signed, when implementation would start. And I think that that was, a tough moment, but it's important that everyone understands how I'm thinking through these different opportunities and what is needed to really get a deal into a place to be forecasted. So it was about the teaching opportunity and also that connection with my team that we are we are one team, but in order to meet the forecast, we have to we have to do more. And then good vibes, like, sales is hard. It's really tough. And, you know, being with someone who's upbeat and keeps energy high, like, that is, I think, a really important piece of a leader is to make sure that the team stays in good spirits, especially when it's tough. When I hear how you describe what you do, I think about when I was a rep. Mhmm. And I think I would love to have a leader like you that's willing to, like, come sell with me, not try to sell me on how to be a better seller. Right? And one of the things that I think that it begs the question of is there's a concept of, alright, there's, a super rep, a a manager that's a super rep, Alito's a super rep that comes in and does the deals for the reps. And then there's one that creates self sufficient reps that can do that on their own, and we come in and work together on things. How do you make sure you're not straying into super rep land when you're activated in this way? It's a really good question. I think let's take that a step back and kind of divide the question into a couple of of parts. So, what is a leader? Right? I think, you know, whether you're a manager, you're a director, you're a VP, the goal is revenue. Right? And so you wanna make sure that you're gaining revenue as sustainably as possible, and it comes down to empowering your reps to do their best work. I do think that respecting your leader as someone that can do your job better than you is important. Like, you wanna be learning from the best. And so staying as a leader, staying involved in the deals is an important thing from garnering respect and having that go both ways. Right? Actually understanding what your reps are going through and not just sitting from some ivory tower and, like, spewing, you know, knowledge that is no longer relevant. So getting in the deals, I think, is very, very important. How do you make sure that you don't go into super rep territory is it's not your deal to win. It's the rep's deal to win. And making sure that the rep stays in the driver's seat and you're there to support them, sometimes that is, you know, interjecting when a conversation's going sideways. Sometimes that is, you know, asking the hard question that the rep needs to save face on. So it's knowing your role, but it's to support the rep in winning. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes.
