## Transcript

So we have made a ton of mistakes selling hundreds and hundreds of deals, and somehow we are still alive. So the number one biggest place that sellers make mistakes is on the first discovery call. So we're gonna draw on my horror lessons as VP of sales and your horror stories as a number one enterprise seller. And so we're gonna break down eight brutal discovery lessons that we learned the hard way so that you do not have to learn them face to face. Number one. This first one you wrote, the playbook of the old enterprise sales guard is dead. I won't show you the product until I rip you with 300 discovery questions. I'm not gonna tell you the price until you intro me to your boss. I won't tell you if I can help you until you quantify the business losses. I won't answer your questions until you're qualified to buy. This is why prospects hate talking to salespeople. I'll see a seller at the fifteen minute mark of a discovery call, and they've done a good job asking questions to uncover pain, get to business impact, what have you. And they actually, like, have enough. Mhmm. And you'll start to smell it in the air where the prospect is like, like, they sorta wanna see something. They're like, I'm getting tired of answering these questions. Like, I I sorta wanna see a demo. I click the request demo button, and there's this internal battle that these reps are oftentimes fighting between traditional sales advice that says never demo on the first call, never give price before you establish value, and what they're actually seeing in the prospect's eyes when they can see the impatience that's happening there. Yeah. And there's a lot of old world sales advice that has sellers almost create this adversarial relationships with their prospects. Yep. And I think it's well intentioned because to sell a 7 figure deal, if you're selling Oracle, you're probably not gonna, like, demo Mhmm. Oracle for a $5,000,000 sale Yeah. On the first call to a financial analyst. Right. But the reality is, like, the game has changed. Like, people can look up product tour videos. People get free trials all the time. People can test drive a car. And if you're good at discovery, the moment you have found a problem that they admit is a problem, and the moment that they say that it's a problem that's worth solving, that usually gives you enough material so that you can do a five minute teaser demo that will actually give them more ideas about the problems they had versus trying to talk about your solution in the abstract. So instead of, like, feeling like you need to follow these binary rules of never show demo on the first call, you should instead be asking yourself, did I get enough and was I efficient in my discovery? And if I was, how can I actually take a piece of what I would normally prospect wants to do? Where a lot of salespeople screw this up is they don't balance give and take on a discovery call with their prospect. And I see, like, the evolution of a novice salesperson to someone who is more seasoned. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Novice salesperson level one, they show up, and they're like, I'm here to sell, and they pitch for all thirty minutes of the discovery call. And then eventually, they get to level two where they they search to learn, oh, I gotta do discovery, but they actually over rotate in the direction where they spend the entire thirty minutes asking questions. And by the end, the buyer's like, well, you just peppered me with questions. I have no idea if you can can even help. Like, is it worth me taking another call with you? Like, I'm not really sure. When you get to level three, this is where you get good. You learn to balance the give and take. And so what you might do is you show that four or five minute demo, and you use the demo as a mechanism to ask more questions. You show them the feature and you're like, hey. Like, how would you see your team using this? And you buy yourself more questions and more back and forth, and it starts to feel like a conversation. And so you're you're in sales because hopefully you have pretty good EQ. Use that muscle. If you sense something is off the way you're running your call, you might need to adapt things. If you've ever been to a great doctor or a therapist or if you've just had a friend, like, give you advice on a problem Mhmm. The best advisors are usually asking questions, asking questions, asking questions, and then saying like, oh, here's, like, a story of when I've seen something similar. Mhmm. Or, like, have you considered this? As they get information once they get enough information to understand, like, this is the problem that you're dealing with Yeah. They pattern match it to make you realize, like, oh, you've seen this before. And then they start to, like, tease solutions because eventually, they're gonna be like, I'm tired of being therapized. Mhmm. Like, can you just tell me what to do? Yeah. And so stop interrogating your prospects and start having a conversation. Alright. Number two is you wrote this one. This is one of my favorites. It's most reps try to build rapport by schmoozing. The top reps build respect in the first ninety seconds by showing you prepped, showing you know their business, showing you respect their time. We call it the ninety second rule. Start your call by proving you did your homework first. The this one was one of the hardest lessons I ever had to learn where I just got dude, I got freaking put in my place by this partner of a really big law firm. So as you know, I used to sell to to law firms, and I'll never forget. I've got this big demo with, like, a group of eight or nine, like, top partners at this big law firm in Century City. And I get on the Zoom meeting with these guys, and I'm feeling a little anxious because, like, these are some, like, legit law firm partners. And I'm like, alright. Like, let me loosen everybody up. Let me let me build some rapport. And I I get on. I'm like, so, like, is everyone based in Century City? I know it's a really nice area. Like, where are y'all calling in from? And I get cut off by, by the managing partner, and he goes, he was, like, super stern. He's like, Nick, we've had a long day of meetings. Can we just get to the demo, please? And I felt like an ant, and I could sense that the the way that these people viewed me, I was down here. They were up here. I was just this little nat who was here to show them a demo because I showed how junior and salesy I was trying to make small talk about where they were calling in from as opposed to, like, starting from a place of credibility and respect. And I got off that demo, and I was like, I'm I am never gonna let that happen to me again. And so I vowed I was never gonna make lame sales y small talk again. If I make small talk about something that shows I prepped for this call, I know their business and is, like, somewhat related to the problems that they're there to solve by looking at my product, I keep us focused on business. I show that, like, I'm a professional, and it gives them a chance to talk about the thing that we were there to talk about anyway. So what I did is I I jotted down. Alright. I sold, it was like this ERP system to to law firms. And I was like, what are all the things that, like, could be happening in their world that I could mention in the beginning to get their respect. And it was things like, had they just won a case? A lot of lots of law firms publicized when they win big cases or had they opened a new office or had the managing partner put out a piece of thought leadership and could I comment on something that I saw there? And I started showing up on my calls, and I'm like, Arman, it's really great to meet you. I I actually just read about the big case win over Acme, and I'm excited to, like, get to to know you a little bit more and get into today's demo. Alright. To get on with the CFO of the law firm, I'm like, hey. Great to meet you. I I saw the news about the big office opening in Tacoma, and I I know there's a lot that comes with the new office opening, especially, like, tax complexities. So I'm sure we'll end up talking about some of that stuff in today's demo. And when I started with, hey. I saw this thing when I did my prep, and I'm not every other salesperson that's talking about the weather or sports or asking where are you calling in from, people started to be like, alright. Like, they started to treat me differently. I was no longer this inferior salesperson trying to butter them up. Instead, I was like, alright. That they saw my game, and it it just changed the way my calls went from there on out. You gotta remember that you're battling the reputation of every other seller who has sold to your prospect and piss them off. And when you show up to a sales call, nine times out of 10, people view salespeople in lower status. If you go to a bar and you tell people you work in sales, everyone's like, oh god. Let me let me let me let me grab another drink. See you later. And that's why it's really important to establish respect, not schmoozy rapport in the first ninety seconds. The example I like to give people is imagine you had been training as a chef for the longest time, and you go eat an amazing duck breast at a restaurant, and the chef comes out. And you're like, oh my god. The duck breast was so good. You're so good at making food, and you give all these lightweight people pleasing compliments. Well, they're gonna be like, this person's a consumer. Mhmm. I'm the chef. I'm the expert in the room. Versus if I look at the chef's cuisine and I'm like, oh my god. The crosshatching you did on the duck was perfect. It made the sear come off just the right way. You must have done the reverse sear, not this type of sear. They're gonna be like, this person gets my business. Mhmm. And they're gonna be like, you must cook. Mhmm. And so the key is you still want your report to be something about them Yep. But you want to be something about them that shows you get their business Mhmm. Unlike most salespeople. And if you do that in the first ninety seconds, you'll notice they'll, like, sit up, and they're like, ah, I look at you a little bit differently. Alright. So this one's also yours, and it's what happens after you build rapport Mhmm. Which is if your prospect says, are you gonna show me the product? Why are you asking so many questions? Can you just tell me the price? You botch the agenda. Set a one minute PPO agenda Mhmm. And get on with it. Purpose, why are we here? Plan, how will we spend the time? Outcome, what decision will we make at the end? Selling to attorneys, they can be pretty, like, domineering, commanding people. And I remember I had a first call with a managing partner of this insurance defense law firm that was on Long Island. And I get on with this guy, and he jumps right in. Like, we didn't have any small talk. He's like, alright. So how does this product compare to what we're using today? Does it integrate with our document management system? Talk Talk to me about what the data migration is like. He's throwing questions at me. And I'm like, I answer one. I answer another. I answer another. And we get, like, twenty minutes in the call, and I've answered, dude, probably, like, 30 questions. And finally, at the end, I was able to, like, be like, okay. But, like, talk to me about what's going on in your world. It it it sounds like you use this product, but, like, what what are some of your pain points? But by then, I had already lost the call because, like, this guy was just throwing questions at me, and I was answering them totally blind. I didn't know much about their situation. I didn't really understand the real problems he wanted to solve. I was literally just like they call it stump the chump. He was just throwing things at me. And it was actually kind of funny. At the time, my company was, doing a POC with Gong, and I recorded that call on Gong. And the rep who was trying to sell my CRO Gong was actually Sarah Brasier, believe it or not. And she did a really good job selling the POC where she checked in with every single rep who was using Gong. And so she got on a call with me, and she's like, yeah. Let's let's look at one of your calls and see some of the Gong insights. And I'm like, Well, let's pull up this stinker of a call. And I pull it up and we didn't even watch the call. At the bottom of the screen you can see, like, the talk to listen of, like, who's talking when. And she goes, Nick, I know why this call didn't go your way. I don't even have to listen to it. I'm like, what? And she's like, I can see there's no long, like, minute long riff that you have in the beginning, which tells me you didn't set an agenda. You didn't tell him, hey. I've got to ask you some questions before I start telling you all about our product. And I was like, oh. So what I started to do then, anytime I got on with an attorney, we would still have folks try to, like, take control of the conversation and just throw questions at me. And what I would do is I would say, cool. We're definitely like, I can answer that question. I can tell you how we compare. I guess the way that I saw this call going today was really purpose was just to see, like, can we even help you solve some of your problems as you're a growing law firm? In terms of how we actually accomplish that, I'm wondering if I can ask you a couple questions first about, like, how you're getting things done today, some of the the challenges you're running into specifically around stuff like billing, and then I can share a little bit about, like, how we might might fit in with that. And then we're probably not gonna have enough today to, like, figure out should you buy this or not, but maybe we can spend the last five minutes talking about if we get this in front of your CFO for, like, a more formal demo. And I would set that purpose plan outcome agenda. And now I had control of the call where I would get my outcome agenda, and now I had control of the call where I would get my questions. But this guy wasn't anxious anymore about am I gonna get my questions answered because I told him you will get them answered in this order. So in the agenda, I set here's what we're gonna cover. Here's the sequence of things, and we're gonna carve out intentional time for next steps. All my calls were easier because there was no longer this, like, friction or tug of war over where the call was gonna go. A lot of times there's this internal tension that reps have when they start building rapport, and it will reps have when they start building rapport, and it will, all of a sudden, start to steer into the discovery call. You bring up the new office launch, and they talk about all their billing problems. And you don't wanna, like, interrupt the momentum of the call and you wanna jump right into discovery. Yep. Do not be afraid to break rapport and just say, like, hey. I totally screwed up here. Just in terms of an agenda, in terms of how we're gonna run this call, we're gonna talk about this stuff first, then we'll talk about how we can help later on. Sorry. Keep going. What were we just talking about? Yeah. Do not be afraid to reinterject the agenda if you find yourself accidentally jumping into discovery motion when you're building a report. Today's show is brought to you by Insight. The CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. I mean, one other place is you talk about on that first call. You show, like, that harbor tour demo that's, like, five to maybe nine minutes long. I set a second agenda before that where I'm like, hey. We're at the midway point. I would love to give you a look at, like, how we can solve some of the things that you shared with me. Like, just agenda wise, like, this isn't gonna be an exhaustive demo, but I think I can show you, like, one or two ways that this might be able to help. And if you like what you're seeing, maybe we can talk about a way to, like, set a more formal demo after that. So I love setting that midpoint agenda as well to, like, keep the call on the rails. Alright. So on the note of questions, here's one that you wrote, which says, most reps ask a bunch of disconnected questions, which feels like an interrogation and rarely leads to real business pain. Instead, go vertical. Use each answer to guide your next question and dig deeper. Example flow. One. Situation. How do you run comp reviews? Answer, spreadsheets. Two, operational problem. That usually causes x or y. Which is it for you? Three, exec problem. When did you realize this was a real problem? Alright. So I'm gonna show this one, and I'm gonna pretend that you and I are on a first date. Woah. Yeah. Very cute. K? I'm cringing already. I'm gonna ask you a question, and I just want you to answer it however you would actually answer it. Okay. Alright. Cool. What'd you do last weekend? You know, I hung out with some friends, played with the dog a little bit. Actually, there's a really cool bar that opened up down the street, so I went there for a little bit, hung out. Awesome. What do you like to do for fun? I'm in a volleyball league. Just joined a new soccer group, really trying to build some community here in in New York City. And so, you know, just trying to get active and hang out with people. Nice. What do you do for work? Oh, I work in, I work in sales. I'm literally interviewing you with, like, a checklist of questions. Yes. There's a certain point where you're gonna be like, why are you asking me all of these questions if you're not doing anything with the answers? You're like, where are you going with this? A good first date and a good discovery call uses what you give me Yeah. To build the next question. So in that first answer you're like, oh, I played with my dog. Mhmm. I might be like, oh, you have a puppy. Mhmm. How old's the little guy? When did you get the little guy? When did you decide you wanted to get the puppy? And you're gonna tell me the story around when you got the puppy. And then I might trade a story of my own. Mhmm. And then I might start to go into problems or stuff like that where it's like, oh my god. What was the crate training experience like? Yeah. Yeah. And now I'm gonna get some emotions in there. And that's how a conversation goes vertically is you go deeper where every question, every answer builds on the next, and then you move to the next topic once the first topic is exhausted. So when I was selling deals at Carta, not on first dates, but actually selling software, I would ask people questions like, how do you manage your option plan? Carta was a solution that would help people issue out stock options Sure. Not using paper certificates, but using electronic stock certificates. Right? Pretty simple. And a lot of times with an easy prospect, I'd be like, how do you manage your cap table? And they'd be like, oh my god. We do it on spreadsheets, and it's, like, super painful. And I gotta deal with these lawyers, and they would answer a checklist question with a problem. Mhmm. And I'd be like, I'm so good at discovery. I'm the man. Yeah. I must be great at this. And the problem is easy prospects. You can ask them a checklist question, and they'll give you a problem. So I go to this next prospect. And I'm like, alright, John. How do you manage your cap table? He looks at me. He says, spreadsheets. I'm like, k. What accounting system are you on? He goes, QuickBooks. Nice. And this goes on for four or five minutes straight where I'm getting one word answers out of him. Mhmm. And most prospects would have been like, I'm on QuickBooks, and it doesn't talk to my cap table, and it's a complete mess. But when someone was a little bit tougher of a prospect, five minutes in, he's like, can you stop asking me questions and just show me the software? Cool. Because I was in the way Yeah. Of him just getting the answers that we need. And so I remember my manager clicked the mute button in the middle of the call, and he just looks at me and he's like, stop asking closed ended questions. And he clicks unmute, and then he jumps in with a question. And he goes, John, my guess is you don't take demos with every single product that you see in the world. I'm curious. Like, you're doing this stuff on spreadsheets. You're a pretty financially savvy guy. Like, what do you want this thing to look like? Like, why are you even here? And he goes on a five minute monologue around all the problems he has with issuing stock options, the investor updates, and all that stuff because he asked a real question instead of a checklist question. So the three layers of questions you can think of are situational questions, and that just, like, tells you about their situation. For example, how do you manage your cap table? From there, turn the situation into a problem. So if you manage your cap table on spreadsheets, I can now say, hey. Typically, when people are managing their cap table on spreadsheets, it's either taking them a lot of time or they're spending a ton on legal fees because they're outsourcing it to lawyers. Yeah. And then I can go into impact. If they say they're doing it on lawyers, I'm gonna be like, hey. Like, it looks like you're around 30 employees or something like that. That probably means you're issuing, like, ten or so years. So you must be paying, like, would it be ridiculous to say you're paying, like, three, four, five grand in legal fees per year just for the options? Or, like, give me a sense of, like, how we can size this up because I wanna make sure we're solving the right problem. Now I'm building one discovery question on the next. Yeah. And I can get to one or two deep problems in ten minutes, and then I can actually move on to the demo instead of asking them qualification questions. Yeah. I mean, you're pulling on the thread. If I go back to that bizarre dating example that felt very uncomfortable for me, one, because it was you and me, but then also, like, your questions were just terrible. I felt like, one, like, I mentioned I have a dog, and then your next question was about, like, what I like to do for fun. And I was just like, oh, I guess what I said before wasn't interesting to you. So I already felt like sort of like you didn't really care about me. But what you're doing is you're pulling on the thread and taking the conversation deeper on the thing that matters. In the dating example you gave, you might ask about the dog because you might be an animal lover also, and you wanna have a deeper conversation about that as opposed to the bar that I went to. In a sales conversation, prospects typically are gonna give you a couple leads to pull on. You're just going deeper on the thing that has the problem you know you solve. For a dog, it might be, oh, okay. What was the crate training like? You can pull on that nightmare. For Carta it's, oh, okay. You're paying for the attorneys. You might have a screwed up cap table or something. And so all you need to know is what's the problem that you solve, get the highest level, and then pull that thread deeper. And that's how you steer the conversation in the right direction. Alright. So this next one's from you. It's your number one discovery question. Yeah. In 2024, I closed $1,600,000 in sponsorship deals. Here's the number one discovery question I used on every call. I imagine this has to be a busy time of year for you. What prompted you to take this call with me? I asked that question every month of the year because it's always a busy time of year for the prospects. But what I'm really trying to understand is, like, what is their motivation for even showing up today? It's the best way to get them talking in the beginning of the call. And the way that I learned this was when I was a new AE, I remember I booked my very first discovery discovery call, and I'm preparing for it. I hadn't gotten, like, real training on how to run a discovery call. And I'm like, what am I gonna say to start the conversation? And I'm, like, sitting there, and I'm, like, writing all of these questions about, like, okay. I'm gonna ask them what system they use. I'm gonna ask them how long he's been looking for a system, and maybe I should ask about, like, what their decision making process is. So, like, I literally had this whole checklist of questions I was gonna ask, but I was really stressed because I, like, I think I had heard from you about, like, the one word answer story, and I was like, I don't want that happening to me. And so I was really, really anxious. So I messaged my boss on on Slack, and I'm like, like, how do how do I, like, kick this thing off? Like, how do I really get this guy to open up? Like, I was emailing him. He was, like, ahead of IT and sort of seemed, like, a little bit closed off, and my boss messages me back, and she's like, what why don't you just ask him, like, why he agreed to meet with you? And I'm like, but he kind of told me that in the email. He said he's thinking about switching systems and would love to learn more. So like, I know why he wants to meet with me. And she's like, no no no no. Ask it live. You're gonna get so much more information. And so I get on this guy. I'm like so, you know Dave, I I I guess this is a busy time of year for you, and, what made you want to meet with me today? And I'm like he's gonna just steamroll. I'm like he's gonna tell me. I told you that via email. The guy goes on a twelve minute monologue, and he is just gushing and gushing. He tells me what system he's using. He tells me how long they've been looking. He tells me what their decision making process is. He tells me what their budget was. He told me about the partners involved in this decision. Literally, every discovery question that I had pre planned, he answered off of that one question. And I realized that when, like, you don't start with business problems, you don't start with their situation, you don't start by asking about their decision making process. You start with, like, why did you even agree to this meeting? And most folks are like, great. You gave me the mic. I'm gonna share a lot. They share what they're looking to get out of the call. They share the background context. It's my number one discovery question. I use it every time. The other day, we were hiring a new outsourced finance and accounting firm. Mhmm. And I jumped on eight different discovery calls with sales reps. And one of the first ones, I get on the call, and the guy is like, alright. What's your growth goal? Mhmm. What's the revenue target you're trying to get to? What's the biggest thing in the way of that? Like, how's your profitability looking? And, eventually, I had to interrupt him Yeah. Because I'm like, hey, dude. I'm not here to get your advice Yeah. On how to hit our revenue goal. I'm here to get your advice because we got reamed on taxes last year Mhmm. And I need your help saving on taxes. And I'm happy to talk about my revenue goals, but I've got a really good plan for that, and I don't need help there. I need you to help me with my p and l and my tax burden. And he's like, oh, I spent the first five minutes talking about the wrong problem because other customers come to me with that problem. The reality is, like, if you're listening to this, most products solve more than one problem. Yes. And there are two ways to do discovery. You can say this is the first problem, the second problem, the third problem, the fourth problem, the fifth problem I solve. Which of them is the one for you? Or you can just be like, hey. Why are you here? And the prospect will be a heat seeking missile for you to get directly to the problem as quickly as possible. Yeah. And then usually, in their explanation, they will give you a thread that hints at another problem, and then you can be like, hey. Based on this, if you have this problem, you probably also have this problem. Could you tell me more about that? Versus just throwing stuff at a wall. Alright. So this next one is your number one discovery question. And so you wrote, my most used sales question by far is when did you realize that was a problem? It's called a magic moment question, and it prompts the prospect to recall a specific moment, turning abstract pain into a real emotional story that sells. Yeah. So a lot of conventional sales advice says that stories sell. If you can tell a story or if you can get your prospect to tell a story, that usually involves emotional pain or emotional problems, and that is the key to closing a deal. But it's actually really, really hard to get your prospect to tell you a story. And so when I was selling compensation software at Pave, a lot of compensation software was an emotional sale. The HR department typically is the first budget to get slashed. Like, if they're going to the CFO and they're like, yeah. I really want this workflow tool that's gonna save me a lot of time. They're gonna be like, you're HR. You're a cost center. I'm not gonna give you any budget for this. I'm gonna spend this money on my sales team so they can go generate more deals. And so we always had to find a way to come up with these, like, painful emotional stories that they could bring up to a CFO, and they would even keep a CFO up at night. Mhmm. And so the way we would do that is we would start with our situational questions. Be like, hey. Tell me about how you're running your merit cycles today, your compensation reviews today. They'd be like, oh, it's on spreadsheets. Classic problem. And then I'd be like, okay. Typically, when you're running these merit cycles on spreadsheets, that usually means that it's taking a ton of time or you're worried about, like, compensation mistakes Mhmm. Or you're worried about, like, you can't oversee all these manager decisions when you're managing comp in a million different spreadsheets. And And then they'll be like, yeah. I'm, like, honestly really freaking out about overseeing all these manager comp decisions. Now that's a problem. Mhmm. But if I can find a story behind that problem Mhmm. There's something really terrifying behind that door. And so the moment you find a problem, all you have to ask is, when was the moment that you realized that this was a problem? And you always get a story. So I would ask that question, and nine times out of 10, they would drop into this horror story where it's like, oh my god. I've got this one sales manager who had someone who had, like, a performance rating of a two, and they give him, like, a 10% comp increase when this other engineering manager had a top performer, and they got a 7% increase. And then they talked, and now the top engineer's leaving the company. Boom. Stories are the linkage between problem and business impact. Yeah. And if I can add up enough of those stories where I can be like, hey. This, like, general gut feeling of a problem you have is what's leading to consistent attrition or bad employee experiences, that's something that I can bring up to a CFO. One of the best follow ups that you taught me to that question is once they tell you that story, you're like, oh my gosh. That's brutal. I'm really sorry to hear that. I guess I'm curious. Was that, like, a one time thing, or is that something that's, like, kept a couple times? And if you can get them to go from this was an isolated incident to this is a trend or this is a recurring thing, it just magnifies that pain so much more. So love that follow-up question that you also taught me there. Alright. So this next one is another one from you, and it says, the five minute drill, three simple questions to qualify real deals fast. One, do you wanna buy? Two, when do you wanna buy? Three, how do you buy? What's going on with this one here? We had this problem when I was the VP of sales at Pave where our SMB, our small medium business segment had, like, a 10% win rate, which was, like, abysmal low. Yeah. And I was like, what the hell is going on here? I was like, the deals are getting from the first call to the second call and from the second call to the third call. And then at the third call, when it's finally time to make a decision, every single deal is saying no. Mhmm. And I'm like, something is going on inside of these calls that's like they get to that third stage and something's not working. And so I started looking at all the calls, and, eventually, what I realized is I would see these reps going into a second demo call. And they would get on a call, they would start showing software, and the prospect would be like, mhmm. Mhmm. Mhmm. And I would ask the rep. I was like, hey. Go on on this demo. Like, what is the problem this prospect said that they wanted to solve? And they would say something like, they love Pave. And to me, that isn't a problem. That's like a sentiment of happiness, and that is the definition of what you oftentimes call happy years in sales, where you look at a prospect's enthusiasm, and you're like, oh, I'm gonna say, like, because they look happy, I think they're gonna buy my software. And a lot of times in sales, you're taught to set next steps at the end of every single discovery call, and I actually think that's a horrible mistake. What I found is that reps were so obsessed with setting next steps after a first discovery call that a prospect would be like, sure. I'll take another call with you, when they never had any intentions of buying in the first place. And so all we did is we literally had our reps ask one question at the end of every discovery call before they set a next step, and that was, do you wanna buy? You don't literally ask that. You say, hey. Before we set a next step, before we go new demo, going through demo is gonna require resources from your team. Eventually, we're gonna wanna, like, propose this up to your leadership team. You're gonna have to burn some political capital doing that, and that's okay if you really see this as, like, a problem we're solving. But based on everything we've discussed so far, is this something you could actually see yourself moving forward with, or is it a nice to have? And nine times out of 10 on those SMB deals, the answer was no. Mhmm. But here's the problem. We were still having that issue. That improved things a little bit. But then what would happen is these deals would get kicked out further and further and further and further, and that's when we added the second question. It would say, like, awesome. Based on this being a problem that's worth solving, your next compensation cycle is coming up in, like, five months here. Right? Is this something that you could realistically see yourself implementing for that comp cycle, or does it still feel too early? And maybe we should, like, punt this out to the next one. Mhmm. And so when you ask, do you wanna buy, you validate whether or not there's a problem really worth solving. When you ask, when do you wanna buy? You validate that they're gonna solve the problem today. And then you can ask, how do you buy? And that's when you set your next steps. But if they're not having a problem and they're not having a problem that they wanna solve right now, you shouldn't even set a next step with them. Alright. So this last one's from you. The way you send a recap email is probably killing your discovery call. Mhmm. You need to take what you normally send and flip it in reverse order. You put the next steps first, then the problems that you solve, how you solve them, and the resources all the way at the bottom. Yeah. So this one, another hard lesson selling to a law firm. I had this it was a sixty minute intro meeting on site with a law firm in Downtown LA. And so I go on-site, I got my suit and tie, and we had a really awesome conversation. They asked me a bunch of questions. We had a bunch of really great back and forth, and I was a voracious note taker. I took eight pages in a notebook like this of handwritten notes. And I get back home, and I'm like, okay. I know I need to send a recap email. And I totally botched this. We're like, dude, it took me almost a week to turn those eight pages of handwritten notes into, like, something that I could actually send to a prospect in an email where I literally recapped, you asked this question, here's how we answered it. You shared this, this, and this, and I literally just, like, regurgitated all of the stuff that they told me and that was my email. And then at the very end, I was like, by the way, we talked about scheduling a demo. You know, do any of these times work for you? Problem was, this was like dude, I I swear it was probably like a four page email. It was like the declaration of independence. And, of course, they didn't respond. And I followed, I followed, I followed, and, like, nothing back. I killed the deal because I was, like, I vomited in the email. And I was, like, there's gotta be a better way to do this. And I think you and I had a conversation. You were, like, bottom line up front. Put the thing they need to do up front. And so now the way I send recap emails, I keep them short and I keep them action oriented. And if I need to send longer form stuff, I'll link out to it in, like, a Google Doc or a mutual action plan or something. But there's three pieces. The action items go first. The things that they need to do. My number one way to move a deal forward is action, not recap. So action items first. Then I go maxed three bullets on here with the biggest problems you said that you had. One sentence corresponding of, like, how we can make it go away. And then at the end, if there's other resources I need to link to, IT docs, integrations, full notes, I'll link out to those. Because my number one thing I need to do to drive the deal forward is get them to respond and say, this time works for our next meeting. So, folks, those are your eight lessons. If you want to actually see what Nick is talking about, we have the ultimate thirty minutes to president's club recap email template that has the next steps, the problems and solutions, and the resources at the bottom. You can go check out a link to that. And then, also, we'll include a link to our ultimate discovery framework that you can use to run your call step by step, and it will prevent you from making a lot of these brutal mistakes that Nick and I made. We'll catch you on the next one.
