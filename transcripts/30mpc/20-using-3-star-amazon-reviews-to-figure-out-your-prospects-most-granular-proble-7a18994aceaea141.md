## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the man with the bad energy. We got Marcus Chan. He is the president of Venly Consulting, the creator of the Six Figure Sales Academy. And, man, he's telling us some stuff about LinkedIn. Nick, why should people listen? If you are wondering how to use three star Amazon reviews to have better conversations with your customers, you gotta stick around. Three, two, one. Leave us a review. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive goes to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Let's dive right into it. So first off, tip number one, how to slide into the LinkedIn DM that actually makes you money. So after you get that prospect that accepts your request, you're gonna wanna immediately send a video DM that's at max forty five seconds. And the way you wanna structure that video DM is immediately go into a quick intro, massive gratitude, then you wanna go into exactly why you reached out. And then third, a very, very low commitment but very high value call to action for them. You'll have that video of that. And then below that, you have some text, which is very similar to what she says. Well, it's very short and easy to read. Do that, and you'll convert at a much faster rate. Awesome. What's number two? Number two. Alright. So number two is how to frame up value before you present pricing so the prospect sells themself before he gets the pricing. And all you need to do, whether it's a first call, second call, or third call, whatever number call you're on, but you're about to present pricing. Before you do that, all you gotta do is say this. You say, mister and missus prospect, pricing aside, what did you like most about what I've shown you so far? And then shut up. Stop talking. Let them tell you all the great things. And after they stop, say, great. What else? Until you've exhausted all the great things, and then you go into pricing because now they sold themselves and how awesome you are. What's the last one? Round us out. Alright. And the third one, it's a phone tip. So it's how to use a very simplified feel, felt, found on the phones that's overcome any objection, whether it's COVID, the pandemic, or anything. So all you say is, hey. Listen. I totally get that. That's exactly what Bobby, Bobby's manufacturer said as well. He was also struggling because of COVID. We sat down. They switched on the spot immediately. We have to meet. How's Thursday at eight? Why don't we go to pricing? Because we haven't talked about that in a minute. And so could you walk us through if we take a step back? Mhmm. At what point during the call are you starting to talk about price? And then we'll talk about the delivery of it afterwards. You can't talk price until you've earned the opportunity to talk about price, and that's so important. Now sometimes I you see it, maybe it's early in the discovery call. They're pushing you for price. You also don't wanna be that sales guy who's like, well, well, well, we're gonna get there. We're gonna get there. We're gonna get there. Right? Because as the buyer, you hate that. Mhmm. You want to have an idea. Right? So and, honestly, they're probably smart and savvy. So if they are pushing you early on in discovery, give them a wide range. Alright? So if you are selling a monthly service or whatever you are selling, give them a range. Hey. Listen, missus mister and missus prospect, depending on all the needs we still need to uncover still, pricing usually ranges from $50 a month to 100 k a month. And, obviously, you could be anywhere in between there, but that's why I'm asking these questions to ensure I give you the best solution to exceed your expectations. So can we continue? Boom. One of the things I have a hard time with when I'm giving a range is people always get anchored to the bottom of the range. They're like, so $50, right, for the whole shebang. Right? And so how do you deal with that when it comes up? Here's reality. You may work with a decision maker who's gonna be they're just gonna be a really stingy person. Like, well, hold on. You said $50. Like, what's that package all about? And maybe you didn't present that pricing. You say, hey. Listen. I'm glad you brought that up. Based on what you told me earlier, you said a, b, and c, and d are important to you. Is that right? Yeah. It is. Okay. Cool. And you literally just told me before I told venture pricing, you just told me all these things you liked. Isn't that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is. So if you want all those things, I cannot give it to you at $50. That price is $90 or whatever it's gonna be. And then now you have an opportunity to negotiate. Right? I kinda wanna talk about this this LinkedIn DM thing if you're okay with that because that's how you ended up even getting on the show. You sent me this LinkedIn DM. Right. And one of the things that you talked about was so you're talking about massive gratitude and finding common ground between you and the person that you're reaching out to. What are those common ground triggers that you're looking for to be able to reach out? You could say it's hopefully a common connection you're seeing them interacting with, but it it shouldn't be just because you have a common mutual connection. Because we we all have connections that we don't talk to. But if you see them maybe commenting on someone's post that you know them really well, that's a great thing to bring up. But, let's sometimes they're not that active. Right? So what you can also do as well is take a look at their profile. What's something on there that you know potentially they could be proud of? Whether maybe it's a recent post, an article they put up. It could be maybe some awards they've won or recognition or anything that's really clearly, it took some time to really point out. It can't be something superficial like, oh, hey. I saw you went to University of Oregon. That's really cool. No. Nobody cares about that. Right? But if, for example, if they're perusing my profile and they're like, you know, like, if someone sent me a DM, say, hey, Marcus. You know, John here with ABC whatever. Hey. I I saw that you you hit presence book every single year. Wow. That's freaking impressive. Notice there they're doing a little brown nosing, but now my ego's boosted. Right? I feel good. So now I'm more open to the rest of the conversation. So within ten seconds of them going to video DM, you want to make them feel really good and open to hear everything else. So I'm curious. You you talked about having this weaved in with a sequence to make it not feel like it's just spam. So how are you weaving in the LinkedIn video so it doesn't totally throw off your workflow? What step does it typically fall into in a cadence? I like to keep it all within the the LinkedIn as much as possible versus going right to the email because they can you can, like it's so much more versatile. Right? Once you get the email, you can obviously use b b mail and some other tools, stuff like that, but it's not the same as having be a native. Right? And having this conversation like a friend. Like, when you're talking with a friend, you usually stick on one platform. You're not like, let me email you now. Let me DM you here. Right? I wanna engage that real personality. Also on LinkedIn because the platform, because with the content, you can really warm them up. So you talked about having a a profile that's attractive, and I'm already behind the curve there. And so if I think about setting up my LinkedIn profile, how do I set it up? Where do people tend to screw this thing up? I want you to picture your LinkedIn profile is essentially bait for your target audience. Right? Like, what are the needs, the heartburns, and desires of your target market? Right? And do not be fooled. Like, do not make it a resume. If your goal is to sell on LinkedIn, my goal is to sell on LinkedIn, then you need to optimize it to sell on LinkedIn. Right? So that means understanding what's important for your prospects. So that goes into first off your picture. Right? Does your picture stand out a little bit? Right? So mine, like, I'm wearing a suit, but I'm not wearing a tie. I wore intentionally a different colored suit. I pop the filters of the blue pops. I'm at a slight angle on black. I look approachable. Right? So it's all bright. And now it's different than everybody else. Everyone else has a headshot. So mine's a little bit of a body shot, slight angle, different. Right? On top of that, I went add a blue ring on Canva. It's completely free, easy add blue ring. Now it stands out more. That's just little gimmicks. That's not a big deal. So when you're engaging on LinkedIn, they see your picture, they see your tagline. Your tagline is gonna tell them should they even interact with you. It just doesn't make sense. Right? So I like mine's a pattern interrupt. Okay? Mine says from Speedos to set you know, selling 7 figure contracts. People like, Speedos? That's weird. Who is this guy? No problem. Now I got your attention. It works. The banner. The banner is a call to action. It has resources in there to give value to my target market from my free group to DM me for help, whatever. So it's it's very clear. Let's just say they're they're still skeptical. They keep scrolling. No problem. Next thing you see is the about section if they wanna actually read that. In there, I've intentionally written it in a way that tells a story that aligns with everything that I know my target audience wants to do. I know they wanna hit presidents club. I know they wanna make money. I know they wanna get promoted. I know they wanna make an impact. And then when you go down further, right, then it's your content. What type of content are you putting out there? Is it of value to your target market? Right? I write about sales stuff and life stuff because my target market likes that. If you're selling to doctors, IT directors, lawyers, your content needs to be a value to them. Then you get to recommendations. In there, I have 60 plus recommendations from sales team and sales leaders. So if they were unsure at any point, still at this point, they can go through and see, okay. You know what? This random Marco Sky, right, is someone okay? So picture it's all real estate to be the right bait to get your target market to be open to a conversation engaging with you. The piece about the optimization is really interesting, particularly from the about me and the headline section. And you sell into sort of a sexy space where it's sales, and it's easy to write about being entrepreneurial and making more money. But what if you sell into something like the IT space? Or I'm selling to accountants at law firms. So if I'm new to a space, how do I figure out how to actually make that about me section something that's appealing to my buyer without just regurgitating we're the leading provider of x? The first thing I'll do is get crystal clear on exactly what's the vocabulary and needs and heartburns that they have. And here's a really, really simple way. Right? So you can either do with the social media way, which is you go into hashtags, look at popular hashtags of your target market, and take a look at what people are posting about in there. Or you look for the macro, micro influencers in that same space and what are they posting about. And then look in the comments and see what people are talking about. That could tell you quite a bit right there. Right? You could also join either Facebook groups or LinkedIn groups that are of your target market as well. So you can take a look and basically you're researching to uncover it. Right? Now here's a super ninja hack. Amazon amazing. Go on Amazon and you literally just type in there most popular say lawyer books, whatever it's gonna be. Right? And look for most popular books. Look at the reviews. Okay? And you don't care about the one star or the five star. Look at the two through four. Those are people gonna post some complaints about things that, you know, they wanna know about. Those are heartburns and pains and desires written in plain language in the language they speak. You take those common things, and that's what you can throw into your profile. I'm literally gonna do that with sales leaders and entrepreneurs right now after this episode. Are you using that anywhere else, like in your cold emails? Because that's gold. I've never thought about that before. Yes. Yes. So picture any type of communication you will do with your target market, you apply the exact same thing. Right? And that applies from cold emails. If you are any DMs, if you are creating marketing materials, it's no different. If you are creating a webinar, it's no different. Like, because what you have to understand is, like, the simpler the message, the more effective the message is. When someone says, hey, Marcus. What do you do? Like, I don't go with some lengthy thing. I help B2B sell more and sell better. That's it. This is where I've been insecure as a rep before where when I first started selling in the space that I'm in, I'm selling an ERP accounting tool. And I was a public relations major in college, so I was so insecure about selling, like, this financial management tool to CFOs. And so I would overcompensate by speaking, like, these really complex terms and and making it as complicated as possible to hide the fact that I didn't really know what I was talking about. And I thought that made me seem smarter as opposed to what you're doing, which is simplifying the message using what you're reading on two star Amazon reviews to speak the language of your customer. Awesome. The takeaway here is make it super simple. Arman, this is what you do. Like, you if you can say it in two words, you say it in two words. You don't say it in two paragraphs. You have a solution that's relatively straightforward enough or you've broken it down so it's straightforward enough. Can you walk us through when you're hitting the phones, how do you describe what you sell, and how do you slide that in? So it's not like, yo, I wanna make your b to b reps better. Oh, it's it's super simple. Right? It's, hey. Mark's with Bentley Consulting Group. I I work with a b and c client. I help their reps sell more and sell better through my programs. I wanna show how can you do the same for you. How's Thursday at eight? I'm that simple. I'm that direct. And you go in for the kill right away? Oh, yeah. 100%. Because here's the thing. My goal is not to engage into a discovery right there. Right? My goal is once I get them on the on the appointment, then I can really have the full time. Like, how often does someone when someone random calls you up, do you have the time to actually engage in a ten minute conversation? You don't. You're, like, busy doing something else. Right? Like, Nick's, like, doing a midday workout or something. Right? Who knows? The way that cold call is gonna go is you're gonna say that you're gonna say how's Thursday at three? And I'm gonna say, okay. Wait a minute. You said you're gonna help my reps sell better. How are you gonna do that? Well, boom. They've just given you permission to now explain how. You got it. 100%, baby. And then like, well, how are you gonna hey. You know what? I'm so glad you asked. That's exactly why we need to meet. So, again, how is Thursday at eight? Oh, COVID. You know what? I totally get that. Guess what? We're all dealing with COVID. So did Arman over at Arman manufacturing who is also dealing with COVID as well. We literally sat down. He loved what I showed him. His revenues are exploding right now. We have to meet. Again, how's Thursday at eight? And lastly, we gotta end with one question. Mister Marcus, we talked about a lot of good habits. There are some bad habits out there. And so my guess is I got a couple in mind. But if you were gonna pick one bad habit to break for every rep out there, what would it be? Stop complaining. Stop complaining. That's a bad habit right there. Right? Stop complaining. Right? Here's the thing. Your complaint may be valid. It can be totally valid. I get that. Right? But stop complaining. Because remember this, when you complain, does it actually change your circumstances? It doesn't. Right? So stop complaining about whether it's your territory, whether it's COVID, the pandemic, the economy, etcetera. And just so you know, and this is gonna shock some people, every single problem you are personally dealing with right now, someone in the history of our time has already dealt with this successfully. You are not the only person. There were times where I was on a sales floor selling deals, and reps would tap me on the shoulder knowing that it closed before I even knew the contract was signed because there are Slack notifications in the channel. And I was like, what the are you guys doing? What are you doing with your time? You're staring and watching other people close deals. I didn't even know that channel existed until I was three months into the job. So you got it, man. Is there anything you wanna leave with the audience before we jump off? I do have a free webinar training right now that's going on for right now. Send to Marcus Chan dot I o forward slash webinar. That's marcus chan at I o forward slash webinar, and it's completely free. That's it. Thanks for having me on, guys. Guys, free webinar. Go attend it. Stop complaining and a recap email in three, two, one. Roll it. Your top four takeaways from the episode with Marcus Chan include, number one, make your value prop simple. Stop overcomplicating things. We help people sell better. Number two, use three star Amazon reviews to figure out what granular problems your buyers have and how they talk about them. Number three, take that and use it to optimize your LinkedIn page and frame your LinkedIn language in terms of how buyers talk about their problems. And then number four, don't pitch right away on the LinkedIn DM. Show some gratitude, chat them up, engage in a conversation. Marcus did this to Nick. And then a week and a half later, you can say, hey. You know, I was looking at that podcast you have, and, you know, maybe it would be cool if we did an interview. Alrighty, Nick. That's all I got. How can people help us out here? I've been thinking about these three star Amazon reviews for pretty much the entire day, and it's making me think about reviews for our show, which don't give us a three star. Give us a five star, but write something nice about us. That's it. Talk to you guys next week. Thanks for listening.
