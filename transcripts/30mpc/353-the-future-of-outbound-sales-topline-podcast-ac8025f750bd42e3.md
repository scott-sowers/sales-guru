The way that you typically do that is through cold email, cold outreach, cold door knocking, cold LinkedIn outreach, cold calling, etcetera. So with that definition so, essentially, us being proactive in market, everything other than people coming to us and saying, you know, I wanna buy your stuff is outbound. Now when we think about AI plus outbound, it feels like the future is spray and pray tech on steroids. If you look back a few years ago, the introduction of technologies like Outreach and SalesLoft, great great technology to build and release to the market, but salespeople used it with their worst tendencies in mind, which is praying and praying. And now this tech seems to just exasperate that. Is that the future as you see it, or do you see a brighter, more exciting future with the combination of these two things? It's bizarre when you look at what an outbound organization actually is today. I wanna paint what it looks like today just to show how ridiculous it is. So when people are sending cold emails, you don't just send a 100 cold emails anymore. You have to set up like 10 subdomains and 10 email handles under each of those domains where I can send no more than 40 emails per day. But in total, I will be able to send 400 emails across all 10 of my subdomains. There's gonna be a point where, like, what happens when everyone is sending 10 emails from 10 subdomain domains every single minute? Like your, your inbox is just going to be cluttered with nonsense perpetually. And so I'll be honest, like once everyone gets good at using these tactics, I don't know what's gonna happen to the email channel because that is the worst and most flooded channel. When you say these reps have to send so many emails, Why? If they were looking at one account at a time and writing an email at a time, you actually personalize it and you target the person. That should potentially also be able to be a productive strategy. Like, why not lean into that? Why this, like, belief that it has to be hundreds of emails? Yeah. The the tricky thing is if you look at SDR quotas over the last number of years, they haven't gone up much. If you look at most SDR teams, you'll see 12 to 16 qualified opportunities in mid market environment. A month. Exactly. It it didn't look that different five years ago. It doesn't look that different today. But the volume has gone up so much. Even if you have a good personalized email, it's buried under so much more stuff than it was before that other people are figuring out how to send personalized emails at scale using email automation tools and more advanced ones. Volume goes up and the top 10% of performers still get replies. The baseline for good is just going to go up. What's the answer? You wrote a book about outbound. What's the right way to do outbound in 2024? How big should the team be? What what sequences or cadence should they be employing? How should we be thinking about it? What's your answer, Ammon? So the first is let's start with the email chain. If I'm working with an earlier stage founder who has a ton of white space, honestly, I'm gonna say there's not a ton of grading, use, and cold calling. And it doesn't make sense to do a ton of one to one personalization because you have all of this white space. I would work with Clay, and I would essentially be like, okay. This is my TAM. I would get really good at targeting. I would say these are my different segments of accounts. And then I would do mass scale email campaigns, and I would send several 100 emails per week when I know I have that much white space where even if I'm burning half of the accounts that I'm reaching out to, it doesn't really matter because I have space. The problem is once you start to get saturated in your very rarely does does a company just indefinitely have the ability to just keep frolicking in all of the white space. And so for companies that I've seen that have some sales reps and they have territories, they have books, essentially what more of like overlay model. And overlay model would say, okay, I'm gonna put in some sort of activity rule where it's like for the last thirty days, if no one has reached out to this account, we're allowed to send AI emails to it. Based on when people engage with emails, we can assign dial tasks to have at both call on the people who are actually engaging with those mass scale emails. Tasks to have at both call on the people who are actually engaging with those mass scale emails. And then do more personalized outreach on key accounts that are really worth having the human touch on. And so it's, it's really just allowing you to fill the white space in your TAM and fill a lot of the gaps of the accounts that you're not necessarily working. And then have the SDRs focus on the things that only a human can do, which would be super personalized emails and cold calls. I still wonder that at the end of the day, I get ten, twenty cold emails a day. I open it, and I haven't even read it. I'm just, like, glancing at it, but in a in a hazy way to look at structure. And I can tell that this is one of these automated emails, and I don't even care what it says. I just, like, kill it right there. And so I feel like everybody is using these tools to kind of look the same and say the same bland things. It's bad and boring, and then I worry that you've got salespeople who are joining these teams in their first role in a role like this. What foundation is this building? We talk about quota attainment of AEs, and we say, well, it's so bad. Part of it is because they have bad foundational training. When we were trained, you had very different things to get their attention compared to what people have to do right now. I feel sad about the state of sales the way it is. I would actually argue that for the last couple years, the SDR job has not looked like a sales job. It's looked ridiculous. The job is 90% scrubbing date. It's like, okay. I need to pull a list of 50 accounts, and I need to scrub the 25 that are crappy ones that are dead, that aren't good, that don't have the triggers that I'm looking for, all that stuff. And then I need to go and scrape one by one above the line, below the line, around the line, etcetera, the right different contacts, and they need to, like, pull different phone numbers. And if the first provider doesn't have it, I need pull it from the second one. And oftentimes what happens is I've seen amazing sellers who would have the ability to hold a call with customers, not make it because they don't know the CRM jockey game. You have a 50% IT degree to do prospecting today. If you have a centralized growth marketing or emailing function where a lot of the mass scale emailing is being done, and you're not worried about these horrendous, like, horribly written SDR emails going out, then what can happen is you can be like, alright, SDR. Here are your 25 accounts this that you need to go super deep and wide. Find out what to break into these accounts. You're gonna look for referrals, go super target, send them something in the mail, call them on the phone. And that looks more like selling today than I think the SDR job has looked like in the last couple years. I mean, it's basically data entry at this point. The data entry aspect is not real sales and actually would ask what's changed in 2024. The the number one thing that we tend to cover whenever we're teaching people how to do outbound is how do you lead with conduct gets you at home office Right? So for example, when we're teaching our cold call openers, the number one thing that we teach is not to lead with a permission based opener, or how's your day going, or did I catch you at a bad time? But if I was cold calling Sam, I would say, like, hey, Sam. We work with the guys over at thirty minutes of presence. It's Arman from pay have you heard her name tossed around? And And so those are the types of things only a human can do. You can scale that in cold email. The bar has just gotten much higher. The bar is no longer, hey. Noticed you fundraised last year. Typically, when you fundraise last year, you have this problem. Do you wanna buy evaluation from Carta? Now the bar is, hey. I was listening to the episode that you had on top line about this, and you had a great riff on this. It made me think about that. And if anything, I can help you automate that research and the context and get it for you much more quickly. Normally you'd have to scour the web and then you, as the human can stitch together that message on your own. A lot of the time messaging is not there yet. It is Very bad. Average SDR, but the average SDR is not that good. And so now what's happened is, again, like, the trigger based email template of notice this thing, we do this thing. That's the baseline. But the best SDRs are doing on top of that. And the floor has just gone up. Pun's right. Anytime I think about my messaging out is always been in this like very clear, critical research. Like that's the things that are making this interesting. That's where we, as CEOs, we, as sales leaders have an opportunity to empower our teams and just be really passionate about the problems that we're solving. Not the features, not the, not the like underlying pieces of it. That's how you have to develop in today's world. You have to be really passionate about what is your, your selling. And that's the challenge is that I don't think a lot of sellers or SDRs are really passionate because they're spending 90% of their time doing data entry. That's the problem. You know, it's funny. I'm a little biased, but you're seeing a slight return of the call center model where a lot of times, because the bar for email is just like so mediocre at this point is these teams are sending these automated emails and I'm gonna assign dial tasks and have my SDRs just rip cold calls all day using a parallel dialer. And some of these SDR teams are doing, like, 400, 500 cold calls a week, which you didn't see that when see That's this is for That's It's cool, actually, in a way. I can tell you this much. Back in the day, if somebody offered me a job where most of my time, I'd be scraping less, I wouldn't take it. Like, I I can't live my life that way. But if somebody said you're cold calling all day trying to get to people and you're using yourself self to try to convince them to take them away. That's fun and exciting. I'm down to do that. So I think, actually, what the role was a disincentive for a lot of people that have all the right characteristics to be a future great salesperson to say, no. Thank you. And now maybe that future great salesperson is like, okay. I'm down to talk to people. Yeah. That's what sales seems like. I don't have to do this lead gen bad email thing. Somebody else does it in marketing. That's not so bad. Where I'm coming out on this, I don't know if this is a hot take. There is no inbound versus outbound. It is the combination of blasting a message into the universe through channels where your buyers congregate. For us, you know, it's LinkedIn, but it could be whatever channel where people are hanging out and giving their attention and putting unique ideas and insights out into the world so that you soften them up. Cold calling in the absence of any air cover from our marketing, maybe it works once in a while, but it's a false dichotomy. It's a false distinction. You need the air cover for marketing. You need people to know who the brand is. They need to know who top line is. They need to know who Armand is. They need to listen to thirty MPC. And then when you cold call them and they see that and they recognize the URL, they recognize the email, then they might be open to having a human conversation. I think either one of those things in isolation is not the key. I think the key is get really focused on your ICP, figure out where they hang out, Last message is through traditional marketing channels, which we would call inbound and layer on outbound on top of it once you know that they're getting the message. Once you're retargeting with ads, once you're re showing different kinds of messages, then you hit them with the outbound. And those things in combination work really well. Correct. And that's to that point. That's when the human selling actually begins. Right. Exactly. Already gotten some of these semi automated emails. Now the human can step in and do the superhuman stuff. And that's truly selling the actual cold calls, the actual DMing on LinkedIn, the trying to catch them at the events. And so, again, it goes back to, eventually, this should look more like selling in the future. That's a really exciting future. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a scale forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks.
