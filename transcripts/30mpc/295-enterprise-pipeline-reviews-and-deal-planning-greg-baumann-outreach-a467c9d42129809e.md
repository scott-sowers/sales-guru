## Transcript

Morning, everybody. Welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my co host, Marc Cosgrove. And today, another member of the Mark Kosko hall of fame, it's Greg Baumann. He is the director of enterprise sales over at Outreach. Oh, man. An enterprise sales leadership episode we have. Mark, why should people listen? Well, listen. I learned a ton from Greg when he was working with me, and this is a GBE. This is a Greg Baumann episode. And when you get into this, you're gonna get the acronyms out the wazoo, so you listen in. I think it's great frameworks. He has a real nice methodology for several things that he does that's easily transferable and actionable. Three, two, one, g b e. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Alrighty, Greg. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Armaud, really a big fan of weekly coaching. So for me, my sellers need to learn and earn while they're working for me. I do that through three key areas. Number one is activity. I'm looking to make sure that they are doing the right things. They're getting in the deals so they can win the deals. Number two, I'm looking to provide strategic guidance. The best sellers are leaning into this and are actually making me support them in this. Ones who are a little bit greener are not leaning in for it. Either way, we need to make it happen. We're doing account plan reviews. We're doing deal reviews and making sure that they have strategic guidance for how to support their customer in the buying cycle. Number three is call reviews. This probably could be its own whole podcast, Armand, but thinking about what needs to accomplish in those call reviews to see, are they starting this correctly? Are they hosting the meeting? Are they asking the right questions, and are they leading with next steps? Number two, we've gotta hire well. So go right now. If you've not done it yet, sit with your recruiting team and your partners in recruitment and make sure that you're doing a full rebuild and evaluation of what your job description and hiring profiles are for your team. The first thing I did coming into leadership role was make sure that we were matching what we're calling for in the market with what our top performers are doing. And guess what? It's not them being a rock star. It's them taking the next level to be creative in their deals, to show that they're customer obsessed by meeting with them on-site and by understanding the value that your tool provides and by seeing your product as a competitive differentiator. Number three, internal selling. Don't just advocate for your team. Equip them with goal, context, outcome, AKA GCO. I love an acronym. So in order to be the best quartile of sellers, you have to get really good at external selling. However, if you wanna be in the best decile of sellers, you have to be really good at internal selling. So one of the best things that I believe the best sales leaders do is to support their sales teams internally, share their wins, escalate and articulate what those great things are that we're doing well that are leading indicators for success. Don't wait for the boom email to happen. See when the boom moment happens and support it. The other thing that I'm doing is equipping them through a framework that I've rolled out to my team to make sure that our exec to exec communications are better than they've ever been. That's with this GCO framework. It's a quick Slack message framework that they're sending over to the EAs of our executives two days before meeting to say, hey. Here's the goal of the call that's coming up. Here's the key context for what's going on in this conversation. Here's the outcome that we really desire. And since you have thirty minutes with them, this is a great opportunity for you to learn these one or two things that you can walk away from. And I would love for you to impress these one or two things upon them that they can walk away from. Customer intimacy dashboard. I wanna know what's on it besides a smooth jazz playlist from Spotify. So for me, it's really important. We know that as a company, we are winning deals more present in our customers. And being present in our customer means understanding the value that we can bring for them. And what is the thing that they hired us to do. It's a simple question that every account executive needs to understand about the accounts they're supporting. For an existing customer, you need to know what was the problem that they hired you to solve. And if you can do that, it's going to allow you to have more meetings to support that problem. So the customer intimacy dashboard that I run is I go I've gone into Outreach, and I filtered against all of the accounts in my team's territory that have open opportunities, and then I reverse filter it in terms of when were they last in touch with us. So anytime it goes beyond two weeks, my team knows to expect to get an urgent task from me in terms of understanding what we need to do to get closer to this customer again to make sure that the deal is going forward, obviously, but more importantly, to make sure that we are continuing the lines of communication that make us a good partner and not just a vendor. So I'm thinking like there's an email, there's a meeting, there's an on-site, there's a phone call, there's these different things. Last activity feels like it bunches it all together, but those have very different connotations to them. How do you break apart, like, oh, they sent an email a week ago. Who gives a crap? But, actually, they were on-site a week ago much different. Like, how how do you determine the level of intimacy? Like, are you just dating? Are you getting married here? So for me, I'm using this customer intimacy dashboard as a sort of, like, let's go over here, gun dog approach. Right? Like, let's go inspect what's going on. So you're right, Mark. For in order for it to be a customer on-site with multiple executives, that's gonna be a really valuable moment in terms of how we're considering the relationship. If it is an email, that's following up with an email that's following up with an email that's not been replied to since, you know, whatever, the last Olympics, that's that's going to be less valuable for me. But what we're doing is using as a point in time to understand because, Mark, if we were to come out of a really impressive meeting that had awesome outcomes in person out in San Francisco two weeks ago, but nothing's happened since. Maybe it was not that effective of a meeting, or we've lost sight of the value that we can bring them or the value that they've they've come to us for. So I'm just thinking, like, gaming, because we we know a big part of leadership is, like, getting through the game of the the stuff that we always do when we are AEs too. But, like, I just hit my Outreach automated sequence to follow-up every ten days. I never get on the customer intimacy dashboard. Baumann's never, like, that breathing down my neck. Like, seems super simple to game. How you how are you how are you helping reps understand they shouldn't game it? The next thing that I look for within this is obviously the gaming because you're right. The easiest way to handle that is through conversation. I think that sellers are the best sellers, especially, are really proficient at being able to turn an ear on somebody. Anybody can spend I can be like, hey, Mark. What's been going on this opportunity that you just keep hitting bumping this up again bumping this up again, hope this email finds you willing to death, and being able to understand, okay. There's there's not value there. What is the value that we can create, and what's like, don't tell me the story. Tell me the plan. Right? So what can we do to fully understand what you're trying to do if we connect with this person? And if so, if you were to snap your fingers and say, Armand is suddenly responsive to Mark, what does that conversation look like? And if we can plan backwards from this, like, genie in the bottle moment, it gives the AE the clarity and direction that they need to put their experience to use. So we'll often sort of frame backwards from, hey. It looks like you're stuck in the mud here. If you were to just snap your fingers and have a meeting with them, what's what does that meeting look like, and what are you solving on that? And let's write for that meeting, or let's pick up the phone and speak to that meeting. So that's a big part of what we're looking at. The other thing, and not to to make another outreach plug here, but this makes it so much easier for us, is I'm able to hover over within the opportunity when the next meeting set date is. So there's a huge difference for again, you mentioned the you know, two weeks ago, everyone was on-site. That's a high value touch point for us. If there's another one of those coming up, we're in a great position where there can be a two week law lull or a three week lull without, you know, captured activity there. But more importantly, if we're able to drive that meeting forward of there's nothing happening after this. Like, there's been no communication. Nothing's happening afterwards. This was a t and e waste. What can we do to really be strategic here and make sure we're capturing and establishing next steps? I never met Find You Wellington. He sounds like a boring but well meaning person. Find You Wellington, I think, has been doing a lot of sales coaching. He's very busy. He's he's hard to book. Greg, you mentioned two things that I think resonate quite a bit. The first is because a manager as a leader, you need a way to quickly comb through twenty, thirty, 40 opportunities without sitting there and talking to your reps about every single one of them. I would always have my reps have the next meeting date at the beginning of their next steps field. So, for example, it would be, like, 04/16, 04/22, 04/28. Right? And then I would just sort by that. And you can see how many opportunities have a date number next to them and how many opportunities have just words, which means you don't have a date on the books. And my rule of thumb was 75% of your ops need to have another meeting on on the books. Otherwise, there's probably not an opportunity in that remaining 25%. The other thing that you res that you mentioned that was really interesting was the other way you can use activity or last activity and prevent people from gaming it is if you use last prospect activity because you can game your own activities. But oftentimes, if a prospect hasn't come inbound or hasn't said anything to you in the last thirty days, that usually just means that the opportunity is dead. So on that note, Greg, like, someone's following up. They're following up one, two, three, four weeks. What's your guidance for your reps in terms of, like, how long they're allowed to keep something in pipeline? One of the things that I really coach my team back to is let's let's go back to sort of a first principles approach. Why did this person engage with us in the first place? And if we can answer that question, we're halfway there. Right? If they came to us and said, hey. Listen. We've got a revenue problem. We need to understand what we can do to increase our top top of funnel so we're building pipeline across our team. Those don't tend to go away over the course of six or eight weeks. Right? Maybe they do. And if if so, I really look forward to hearing that podcast, Armand, if you you wanna have them on. But more often than not, we need to understand why did they come to us in the first place, and what can we do to get back to that conversation. We're selling to and we're supporting very busy executives. We're supporting very busy people, and it's makes perfect sense that we might not be number one on their list all the time. Maybe we're number three. And if you're number three on somebody's list, you're not going to get that first response, and you can still get a deal done from that. And they might have you really respectfully slot it as a number three for them. But, for us, it's really helpful to make sure that my reps are aware of, are they slow to reply because it's travel baseball season and they're slow to reply to everybody right now because their kid's on a team, or are they slow to reply because they've lost vision for the values that we can provide them, or they feel like they can provide that somewhere else? Each of those would give us different walking waypoints for, let's go ahead and kill it, or let's find a new creative way so we can become an obvious point of connection to them. I'm kinda tight on this, and I do wanna preface it by saying, like, this is mostly my guidelines for SMB and mid market. Enterprise is a very different beast, but, like, SMB and mid market, I want them to I want the rep each week to say this is my next step. It needs to be binary and action based. I will book a meeting with this person. There's no ambiguity there. You're that's the next step. Right? First week that a rep doesn't do it, I say, listen. Sometimes it takes more than a week. But did you put in the effort? And if they show me they made an email, did a call, alright. Great. You put an effort. Alright. Let keep doing that. Second week that they haven't completed the next step, I say, listen. We need to come up with a more creative strategy. What we're doing isn't cutting through the noise. It's taking us two weeks to help this person. When somebody needs insulin, they don't wait two weeks for it. Right? So we need to sell and get some urgency here. Third week, what I do is I say, listen. We're either not in a deal, we have the wrong person, or we have the completely wrong message. And we have to dial those three things in and figure out almost not almost always, but a lot of the time is that we just don't have a deal. We've started with the wrong person or whatever, and it's time to clean that out and concentrate on the deals you have. So and I'd also argue, Greg, like, I love to look back, like, what have you done next? But the look forward to me is, like, so valuable. When is that next meeting? If your rep comes into a deal review and says, I don't have a meeting for two weeks, and they don't have a plan and what to do in that two weeks to make that deal even hotter, then guess what? Like, they're not really a great seller, and you're not doing your job as a manager. Get those people prepped and ready and selling and excited about those meetings coming up. And the thing that I would add to that too, because, Mark, that's a great point. And what I would say, specifically, my team, we look after our largest customers at at the company. And, you know, my background is in is in strategic and enterprise accounts. The best thing is again, we've got this awesome meeting coming up in two weeks. Down market, you're gonna wanna make sure that that the rep is keeping that meeting on the calendar. That's that's gonna be step one. Step two is gonna be, like, can we make sure that that meeting is an outsized outcome for us and for the customer? Maybe that's sending over, like, a preread video or a preread document to say, here's what we're discussing. Let us know the questions you have, or here's what we're planning on discussing. Like, we welcome feedback on this. But then, really, like, as we move to the enterprise, we know and, like, this has completely validated this. And if you spend four and a half seconds on LinkedIn or on Gartner or Forrester website or anything of that sort, you will know that the buying committees are exploding in size. So if that if you're resting on your laurels waiting for that meeting in two weeks with one person and not doing the work to understand who else should be part of that meeting, you're going to have a much smaller sort of outsized outcome in terms of what happens even on a highly successful meeting. Someone's gonna get mad at me for using this analogy, but you can't it it never goes anywhere if you're going on a date with someone every four weeks. It just it's moving too slowly. Like, you forget half of the things that happen. Other things have gone on in your life. And oftentimes, deals are moving on a steady forward efficient cadence if they're actually going to close. So, Mark and Greg, you guys see today, it's April 16, and you see a next step and that next meeting, we'll call it as a it's after Cinco de Mayo. Right? They wanted to make some time for some margaritas. They wanted to take some time off, or maybe they got ahead with you and they need some time to evaluate other competitors, and they wanna meet again on May 15. What should your rep be doing between April 16 and May 15 to be keeping the deal active? So the first thing that I'm coaching people to is, number one, you wanna understand why that is. Right? Especially if you've built that early rapport and you've built that early connection with them. Why is this? And, Arman, it could be, hey. We've we've taken three steps ahead of what we're doing for you. There's a couple of other vendors or solutions we need to validate here. Part of the process doesn't mean you're losing, doesn't mean you're winning. It it just means that we need to get back to you after, you know, after Cinco de Mayo, which is a big moment in the fiscal calendar. I think everyone knows that. One of the things that you need to do is sort of validate what that timing is, especially, again, for our friends in EMEA. They'll take a two or three week vacation as well, and so that could just be the next business day that they have available is mid May, right, coming from mid mid April. So for us to really understand what that is can be really big and can set those next steps. The other thing that like, I I firmly believe this is that the b two b sales process should be way more informed by the b two c sales process than it is and that it often is. And so for me, if I'm making a considered purchase, even if I'm not ready to hit send on that brand new m three MacBook Pro yet and I'm still sitting here with my m two, I'll want to understand and educate myself. I will be spending five or ten minutes at a time on apple.com's website looking at the specs. Right? Is this really what I need? I'll be looking at reviews. And so doing what you can to support that, not just by sending them a dead link, and saying serve yourself, but really showing them sort of a boutique level of, listen. Ignore these emails. Feel free to not reply to them. But I know as you're thinking through these items, these are moments that buyers care about, and they may be of interest to you. So I think making sure that you can educate them on not only your product and and why they're in it for the first place, but making sure that they're successful in sort of the the nonproduct element of this. What is it gonna take for them to adapt? What's it gonna take for them to adopt? What's it gonna take them to excel once you all move forward together? Good account plans is basically zero. They do it because their manager says to do it. It's on some stupid spreadsheet. It's some stupid template. It's got limited value. Of course, every time a rep actually takes time to do it, they're like, wow. This is super valuable. I should do this more. Like, how are you getting your good reps to do this and to show other reps that is super valuable to them? Great question. So, you know, Mark, I'm on to make sure you don't lose your entire audience from this by saying that reps are bad at account plans, I'll say that most reps are bad at account plans because most sales leaders are bad at account plans. I've seen so many failed expectations and and where sales leaders are setting up a wild goose chase in terms of what needs to accomplish on an account plan. The bar is frequently, like, pull together your best McKinsey consulting PowerPoint on what is going on at global company. Right? What are they what do they sell? What are they up against? Who are their competitors? And there's so there's so much goodness in there, but only if you let it be good. What I've done for my team is I've actually rolled out something earlier this year called an MVAP. It's a minimum viable account plan, and it's focused on the action oriented nature that needs to happen in the account. It really just comprises of three questions. So high level is the hypothesis. This is something that they're supporting on their own. They're using a chat GPT prompt to understand what is going on with the account. We can capture that in ideally two or three sentences. Maybe it's a paragraph. The second is, what is our win now? Right? So what is our first land? Here at Outreach, we do a land and expand model. We like to think, especially in the account planning motion, that we're going to take down the entire company in a single bite. It's not happened yet. Right? And so being able to understand what is that first win that we can get the attention, that we can get the budget, that we can provide them to be a successful customer. And then the third is I have them call out specific people that we need to be reaching out to given the hypothesis that they've created and given the opportunity for us to have a first win. That is broken up into a couple of different components. Number one is, who at the account are we already attached to as a key above the line or on the line contact. So this ends up looking like they will hyperlink this out to LinkedIn or they will hyperlink this out to Outreach and say John Smith and Mary Jones are both people that we wanna reach out to because we have a relationship here. The second category is alumni and champions. So they're able to use LinkedIn sales navigator filters to understand, at this new account, have they come from a customer account before? And the concept and differentiation between alumni and champions that we've rolled out are number one is alumni. Right? So if I worked at Oracle a decade ago, I don't know a ton of people at Oracle still because it's been nearly a decade, but there's a sense of home or pride that people have around the places they've worked in the past. And so if I can help my team understand, hey. Listen. You were with a, you know, a customer of ours a decade ago, and they've had a lot of success with it. How do you feel about, you know, being an ambassador for us in terms of as we get to your new company or what we would do to support you? Additionally, we have champion messaging where we say, listen. You were just at an Outreach customer nine months ago. You rolled it out. Looks like you were the global head of rev ops. You probably saw a lot of success with us. Are you interested in running it back at your new company? And then finally, account plans really need to not only be actionable, but stretch the imagination of the account team. And And so I have them do a a, like, a genie in the bottle, essentially. If you were to have snap your fingers and be able to meet with any anyone at the account, who would that be, and what can we do to work backwards from there? We'll take those people through the first and second degree connections of our board members and our c suite executives and work for a direct actionable plan to get in front of our most high value targets. I love this idea of a first win. Like, that that's that's that's that kind of, toe hold or finger hold that a rep needs to climb the mountain of that account. Right? Like, give me can you give me, like, two or three examples of really good stories of first wins and how they worked or, like, what peep what people came up with? So a first win that I was reviewing recently with somebody on my team is she found that there was an opportunity for us to serve, I think, maybe 1,500 go to market folks at a net new account. Right? They had bought a they had bought a subsidiary of ours, and now we were sort of in their ecosystem, and this is a new account for the seller. So there are 1,500 people for them to reach out to, but they're not gonna sign up for 1,500 people immediately. What's a quick win that we can have? And what we'd found was, the company that they had acquired had been using Outreach for their digital sales division. So these were people who are, sales development reps or inside sales folks, and they were seeing a ton of success with the platform. And it was becoming a model for them that was going to be instrumental not only into the subsidiary company, but also potentially to the parent company. So when you look at those quick wins, what my seller was able to do is she put a plan forth to the contacts that she was able to get in front of at this new parent company to say, listen. We wanna go for this broader business, but there is a win now for you to be able to replicate the success of you founding the company you just acquired. Let's go ahead and make this win now. Instead of 1,600, let's go ahead and start with these 70 people, get them onboard on the platform, and then we're able to be really tactical and specific of what does that win now mean. And it's not the signature on April 1. It is a signature on April 1. It is a training by May 1. It is a successful launch by June 1. It is this much meeting or revenue attribution by July 1, and we'll be able to look backwards. And we're able to have those conversations for what is that first win. You can bring everyone on the same side of the table and plan that out together. That's enterprise selling right there. Greg, how do you help your reps decide if they should go for the initial land or if they should try to eat the entire buffalo in one big bite? Such a good question. I I think that this is where we can kind of move from, like, a clean-cut science to a little bit more of an art form. Right? So we're constantly yo yoing, and I know at Outreach and on my team sort of back and forth between that. Hey. We've got 25 people right now who are willing to get on board. Do we need to roll this up to a 100 people to get them started, or, you know, do we try to aim for a thousand? Like, where do we aim for this? One of the things that I've really focused on with my team is is, again, just creating a culture of discovery, not only internally, but also with the customer to say, what is a reasonable amount? Like, 25 feels like an 25 people feels like an easy deal for us. It feels like it's in front of us from our side and from your side. Have a conversation about just getting that win now and that we can prove success together. Maybe it would be foolish of us to go for something bigger than that if they have already come if the customer's already come to the conclusion that this is a viable group for them to start and to see the ones they need. Otherwise, we know that 25 could is a very, you know, quote, unquote, even odd number that people could just say, well, I think we get budget for 25 people, and there's about 25 people in EMEA that that would be great office for it. Can we do a little bit more discovery with the customer to say, okay. Is this a sizable enough group that you'll be able to prove the success that you want? And if not, let's find a 100 people, or let's find 50 people. Let's find people that we can really prove the value of not just our tool, but of your project and your revenue goals. And so for us, it's really it can be different every single time of do we need to take down the 25 and and be a good partner? Or in order to be a good partner, do we need to take down a 100 or 500 from that first deal? So I think it's about being customer oriented, aligned to their goals, and not being afraid to ask those discovery questions. The other thing that comes to mind is we have managers, leaders, directors, what have you, from companies of all sizes and of all deal cycles. And I imagine there are some people who are doing more of a transactional sale who are like, yeah. I can't really do an account plan where it's like, first, I wanna reach out to employee number one and then reach out to employee number two, and then that's it. At what deal size or at what deal complexity does it make sense to start using account plans? Why I released the minimum viable account plan for my team? Is it because it's because it's something that they can do, like, within an hour. They will do this for really every account. Okay? So my team is the enterprise focus team, so they've got about a couple dozen accounts in in their portfolio. Right? So it's something that's easy enough for them to knock out of the course of, call it, the first month of the fiscal year. For the people that are sort of you know, maybe we have a multimillion dollar deal. They're the MVAP is not going to support the amount of multithreading that we're gonna do on our side and the amount of additional research that we're gonna do for the customer. And so we actually will pivot from that MVP to an account overview plan that we have developed internally. And that's, like, your classic probably seven to 10 page PowerPoint where they're going through, okay. So who's using it? What are the workflows? What are the outcomes? Who's not using it? Who's using it well? What are our plans there? So, Armand, to answer your question, I think you can start it as low as you want in terms of deal size because having a plan is critical. I think making sure that as leaders are thinking about capturing that level of planning for their team, make sure you've got a bar that's low enough to add value to your sales team even if they're only doing $10,000 deals into a 100 person companies all the way up to if they're doing $17,000,000 deals at 20,000 person companies or a 100,000 person companies. Well, Greg, amazing show. Unfortunately, it's thirty minutes to president's club, not forty five minutes to president's club, and so we have to wrap for our final question. We talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit. But if you were to say, what is one bad habit that every sales leader should break today so that all teams out there get a little bit better? I love this question. It's my favorite part of the show, and that is lack of specificity. I think it's the biggest bad habit that sales leaders have. There's a big push to be like Marc Casaglow. How am I gonna be like Marc Casaglow? Do I have to look handsome? Do I have to show up on LinkedIn all the time? What's that mean? And instead, what we wanna do is say, I want you to be like Marc Casaglow. He communicates in this way. He follows up at this time. So having a level of specific precision with each person on your team is not only gonna help coach them up, but it's gonna help you form a mental model for what it means to be successful on your team and in your organization. So be specific. Folks, if you wanna be like Greg Baumann, you wanna be like Marc Kosiglov, click this one on repeat because this was a heck of a show.

I love this idea of what's the first win we can get an account. Like, talking about it, visualizing it, strategizing it. It's like I said, the the toe hold or the foothold that allows you to, like, climb that mountain deal. I just I just love getting started is the most hard this is the most difficult part. Like, get started, and that first one does that. And then number two, I've never thought about the difference between alumni and champion. Alumni is somebody that hasn't been there for a while, but there's still some nostalgic pool. Maybe they know a couple people, but, like, there's some kind of innate desire to for them to help a company they used to work for. They're known as a champion. You just left. You got connections. You know people. I need you to help me out like you're still working there. I thought that that was a really useful designation to talk about breaking into accounts. Number three, last activities, next meetings. Those are the two ways that you can very quickly skim through twenty, thirty, 40 opportunities and figure out what's real in your pipeline. And number four is if you find that there's not a meeting on the books, you might use Mark's three steps to finding BS pipeline. Number one is did you even follow-up with the opportunity? If you did, maybe in your second week, you might need to find a creative way to get a response. And then number three is if you're still not getting a response, at that point in week three, you might realize that you don't have a real deal, and you might need to go contact someone else. Alrighty, folks. So if you like this one, go connect with Greg Baumann on LinkedIn. And recently, we've been writing more leadership stuff on our newsletter.
