## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with Nick Sigelski, who is my cohost. And we today, we have the one and only Kayla Citron Thaler, and she lifts some serious freaking weights. I think her one rep max beats mine, and it definitely beats Nick's. So, Nick, why should people listen? She blows us out of the water when it comes to the weight room, and she also blows us out of the water with the number of meetings that she's booking with enterprise level technical buyers using video on LinkedIn. Three, two, one. Pump you up. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright. Kayla, welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. So the first is video. Make sure that you're using video because it's a scalable way to get above the noise. Make sure that you are changing the title of the video so it doesn't just say, hey, thrift video. It's actually their name. Look at their profile during the video. Have your head in a bubble, and make sure it's no longer than sixty seconds unless what you're saying is the most engaging thing they've ever heard. Nice. What's number two? Do your research before you do your video. So take the time to look at their LinkedIn, see what they care about, look on a Google search of talks that they've done, articles they've written, books they've written, even look at their Instagram and see if they care about ice cream, if you could tie that into your value prop. Very cool. What's number three, Kayla? So make sure that your LinkedIn is engaging, that when prospects come onto your profile, you're someone that they wanna engage with. So start posting once a week about what your prospects care about and really start engaging with their content, liking their content, commenting on their content, and really become relatable to your prospects. What's inside of a 15 video? Because, like, I I can barely say hello and introduce myself in that time. So I would keep it more than fifteen seconds, but less than sixty. Usually, if they've connected with you on LinkedIn, I'd say, hey, Arman. Thanks so much for connecting. The reason for my video is blank. So the reason could be because you're in sales, and I could say, hey, Armand. The reason for my video is I noticed you're in sales, and I noticed that and I'm just making this up, that you played on soccer teams. And something that's really important for soccer teams is to work together well, which is exactly what's important for data science teams is to collaborate well together. So, essentially, we've helped the teams at Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly to centralize their data science work, get models into production quicker. Would this be worthwhile to have a conversation? There you go. And so you're leading with the problem. Right? You're not leading with all the features and nonsense and logos and all that good stuff. Yeah. I would say another tip is don't lead with features. No one cares about features. They want their pain to be solved. So understand what your prospect cares about. Understand on a day to day, what does their day to day look like? Do a Google search. Interview people. Ask if you can talk to people. If they say no, I won't take a meeting. Say, hey. Can I get fifteen minutes on your calendar to understand what your day to day looks like so I can personally grow? And through my experience, people are always open. I actually had a CIO at Caterpillar, and I said, hey. Can I have some time on your calendar? He said, I'm actually in a different position now. And I said, can I have fifteen minutes on your calendar? I'm not gonna talk about Domino. What I'm gonna ask is how I can better myself, how I can understand what your persona cares about, and how I can really understand what's going on in your company. And so you're immersing yourself in the space. You're leading with the problems. Way too many people lead with their features, and you're not doing any of that stuff. When you first start the video, you you talked about looking at their profile. What are you doing there? Are you, like, zooming in their LinkedIn? Like, what happens at the beginning? So make sure that when you're recording, it's on their LinkedIn profile. So I would not recommend using a whiteboard. I would not recommend making it of you. What I would say is be looking at their profile. So on Drift, and I'm sure Vidyard has an option for this also, your head's in a little bubble at the bottom of the page. You are showing them that you can only send this video to them. You also are subconsciously creating familiarity because they know what their LinkedIn profile looks like. So that's a feature on and I've used this both on Vidyard and Drift where when you're about to record a video, you have three options for how you can record. It can either just be your face, it can be either just be your screen, or it can be your face in a bubble in the lower left and your look and it actually shares the screen you're looking at. So you're going through their LinkedIn profile while you record one of these videos. My question for you is, are you scrolling through their profile? Are you clicking on anything? What does that part look like? So I'm actually keeping it static, and I used to scroll. But because I'm moving in my little bubble, it can be very distracting to the person watching the video. And so really where the engagement should be coming is from you what you're saying. And so I would say don't scroll because it's just too distracting. Don't move your hands in the video. I used to do that. Make sure you're not moving your hands. That's especially distracting. Make sure that just what you're saying is engaging. And also remember to be human. So if you mess up, that's okay. It's that human aspect, and they know that you're not a robot. So I'll mess up and I'll say, I'm so sorry it's Monday. Or some piece of creating that authenticity and that really showing that I'm just another human, and so you relate to them on a human level. And that's why I think a lot of times email doesn't land for me because I'm just another email in their inbox. But when I send them a video, they feel like they kind of owe me something because I've put in the effort and they can say, you know what? I'll meet you halfway. And for those of you who are reaching out to a really technical audience or a persona that you think is the most challenging persona to get into, At the end of the day, we're all people. And so it's how can we relate to other people. And I'm reaching out to IT leaders, CIOs, data science leaders. So there's no excuse to say my persona won't do well with this outreach. And just make sure that you're creating that human aspect and that human connect. So, Kayla, one of the things that I know you're a big proponent of is personalization in the videos, and I'm curious if you're doing anything beyond just looking at their profile. Are there common ways to personalize, like, you mentioned the sport? I know people will often use the university that somebody went to. So when you're skimming someone's profile, you're looking them up for the first time, what are things that you're commonly hooking on to to personalize that video? So I would say I'm looking for pieces that aren't necessarily work related. I'm looking for a Google search and maybe I find their Instagram and there's something there's actually a video I sent to someone and I saw his Twitter. I love Twitter, by the way, for looking at people. And I saw his Twitter. I saw he liked to ride motorcycles. I saw he had some kittens and birds. Obviously, play it to how you think the prospect will react, but I love non work related pieces and being able to creatively tie that in. But also, I would say if you see that someone says, hey. I manage a team of 25 data scientists. I'm latching on to that. In general, I'll have the same ish pitch for the same persona, but I'll tweak it to either some research I've done, a talk they've done, some article on YouTube. You can even open the transcript on a video, and you can search for specific words. So you don't have to actually listen to a whole hour long talk. You can just skim or you can search, for example, data science and find anytime they mentioned data science. So I would say being able to skim and easily do pieces, but also making sure that you set time blocks on your calendar to say, I'm only gonna spend three minutes on this person. If all else fails, I can search for a company. I can search for an annual report. And if all else fails, I'll just send them a video, call their name out, say I assume or generally, when I talk to other data science leaders, this is what I hear. If you're struggling with problem a or problem b, would it make sense to have a conversation? So, Kayla, one other thing I've heard you do in your videos is you rap to your prospects. So I'm curious. Can can you give me a sense of what the heck that's all about? A live rap would be great. I don't even know. Not. Sounded like I think that's the piece of creativity. If you find something that's a nugget so this prospect had done a presentation that was called 99 problems, but spark and Databricks ain't one. I had no other option. It was a wrap. That's all I could do for him, and that was the only way that I could get above the noise. And so his reply, I think, was, Kayla, I don't usually reply to emails, but at least this deserves fifteen minutes of my time because you put in the effort. So it's how do we put in the effort? And so often in sales, we're trying for that easy fix or that silver bullet, and it just does not exist. So on the piece of wrap, I saw this guy did a wrap, or there was a the SVP of AI at Royal Caribbean reports directly to the CEO. He was quoted in an article that said the head of a data scientist, part of a poet, and I wrote him a poem, and it booked the meeting. So it's how do we find these pieces and look out for these pieces. Obviously, they are few and far between, but if we find those pieces, leverage that. And you can embarrass yourself. You can be the I'm the worst rapper alive. So but the effort that was put in is what mattered. So you talked about time blocking this and making it efficient, and I find that very few people have been able to make video scale. So I wanna get into some numbers here. So could you give us a a sense of on a daily basis or on a weekly basis, how many videos are you trying to send out so you can connect with prospects? So I'm sending about 10 to 15 videos a day. Since I've been at Domino, which has been two quarters, I've sent around 800 videos. So it does take time, but the importance is setting those calendar blocks and not mixing up your activity. So you'll set an hour of research. You'll set an hour of creating videos. You'll set an hour of whatever activity. And I say, this runs throughout sales. Set time blocks on your calendar to do your activities. So whether it's cold calling, set an hour aside. Make sure that you set those time blocks. And maybe if you only can do a task for twenty minutes, set that and come back to it later. But make sure that you're organized, and the most successful reps and SDRs that I've seen really are good about organization. And if you you look at all the meetings you're getting from those 800 videos or those 10 to 15 per day, How many of your meetings are coming from video versus the standard channels, like your emails of the world and your phones of the world? So I would say upwards of 85% are coming from video. And I think I've booked two meetings from video over email, and the rest are through video over LinkedIn with someone I'm connected with. Really? So that's that's a really interesting distinction. So you're finding more success using your video not embedded through Vidyard or Drift on email, but through LinkedIn native videos? Yeah. So I think that's the piece of what I mentioned in the beginning is make sure that your LinkedIn profile is engaging. I have a engaging LinkedIn profile. I intentionally on my profile, right, that I like to lift. If someone comes to my profile and they like to lift, we have something in common. Or if they see one of my lifting videos and it's inspirational, no matter what industry they're in, it's still inspirational to them and they see the content. And there was actually someone who I booked a meeting with from Stanley Black and Decker, and he said something along the lines of the way you combine sending video and getting on my news feed is genius. And so it's really about just posting on LinkedIn about what you're passionate about. And no matter what industry someone is in, they will still be inspired if you actually are inspiring. But what if you're not inspiring? What if you're like, well, I really like playing Grand Theft Auto and eating chicken wings. Am I supposed to film a video of that and put it on the feed? Like, I guess You could. Bit bit bigger question here is what sort of things would you encourage folks who don't really have any sort of professional social media presence to start putting out there. Because it's really tough to go from zero to 100, and I think there's often hesitation from individual contributors about, like, what's my boss gonna say when he sees this stuff on LinkedIn or she's gonna see this stuff on LinkedIn? So I think let's say you play Grand Theft Auto and you're passionate about chicken wings, post about that. Right? So see if you can tie some I don't know much about Grand Theft Auto, but maybe some car journey that you went on and how that relates to sales or get creative with it. Or you can just I know Morgan Ingram post about his gaming stuff. Right? So it's more important to post than to be afraid of what people are gonna think. And I think that's something that you should always keep top of mind is just post on LinkedIn and start once a week. You don't have to post five days a week. You don't have to get a ton of engagement. But, also, if you are in whatever market you're in, or let's say you're searching for a job, what I always say is post about what you know so that when that that job interviewer comes around and says, hey. Well, do you actually know how to do this, or what's your thought process around this? You can just say, hey. Here's this LinkedIn post I wrote. Or they'll probably look at your LinkedIn anyways, and you'll build that trust before they even have to ask. So I would say if you have nothing to write or you think you have nothing to write, start doing research on your industry. Start researching interesting articles in your space or start when you're doing your research on prospects, create bookmarks of your articles that you're finding and tag your prospects in them and talk about what you found interesting in that article. Well, I think what a lot of people screw up here is you're not talking about like, how much stuff can you post about IT that's, like, really eye catching? You're posting stuff about lifting weights, and it caught my eye. And I didn't even know if you were in sales or not. I post all this stuff about angry ranting sales tactics and that's sort of my shtick on LinkedIn. And I'll get people who are chief legal officers at other companies reaching out to our general counsel at Carta saying, oh, I heard, like, you guys have the sales team. And so legal was not my target audience at all. But if I'm connected with my target target buyers and they see me posting stuff, then they naturally have a perception of, hey, this person isn't isn't a complete rando. Now you don't wanna put post a bunch of stupid stuff, but you you do wanna do some stuff that stands out and makes you fundamentally different from everybody else. And I think a piece of that also is about building your network. So some people I've heard are afraid to connect with people for some reason, or they're very protective over their connections or who they're connecting with. And I would say just connect with people in your industry, whether you're trying to sell into them or not. Obviously, don't get locked out of LinkedIn jail, which happens to me on a weekly basis, but make sure that you are sending requests to people who are in the industry. And you can look at their content and reshare it or whatever you wanna do, but also, rule of thumb, send blank connection requests. People know that they are gonna be pitched if you are sending a message in your original connection request that is not hyper hyper personalized. And those hyper hyper personalized messages are not scalable. So you are doing a lot of research upfront, and who knows if they'll ever even accept your LinkedIn request. So can we talk about the I wanna get get a sense of what your workflow looks like because it sounds like 85% of your meetings are coming from video. So are you just literally, like, putting together a massive list and clicking connect, connect, connect, connect, connect, and then the next day it's like video, video, video, video, or, like, are you mixing in other stuff, or is that literally, like, your workflow entirely? So I'm working through tasks. Obviously, I have to move through stuff. But because I'm in the enterprise space, my AEs create lists of people who they want meetings with. They'll use LeadIQ, put those people directly on the cadences that I have, reassign those people to me, and I just work with people. So I'll connect with them. If they connect within the first seven days, I'll throw them on a separate cadence, which is mainly LinkedIn heavy, which has a video first. Both of my cadences have a video first, but my LinkedIn is more video and GIF heavy. But, basically, I'll move people through. I like to do walks, though, especially for my research. So I'll sit down and I'll see who's coming up, and I even have a step in my cadence that says do research. And so I'll do research. I'll put whatever links I find in the notes. I won't actually create the message then and there, but I'll be finding whatever information is important. And then I'll be completing the task, and in a few days, I'll call them. And then if they don't pick up or I don't connect with them, then I will send them a video. On LinkedIn, once they accept my connection request, I'm sending them the video right away. I think that you shouldn't send a message that says thanks for connecting or anything that's not gonna really hit them with a bang. And so I think it's okay to connect and pitch only if you're doing something different and something personalized. In any other case, saying, hey. Thanks for connecting. I do this. I do this. My company does this. No one cares. Let's be real. But if you put in the effort, someone will care. So, Kayla, one of the best practices I've heard related to engaging with a buyer on LinkedIn is to engage with the content that they're putting out there, whether you're commenting, liking, tagging, or sharing. And so I'm curious. How do you build that social engagement into your prospecting workflow? Because you can't predict when Arman is gonna make a angry post about whether or not to leave a voice mail. So I admit that I am not the best at it, and I should get better at it. But I think it's the importance of creating some connection, and I do think there's a lot of value in liking people's content, engaging with people's content. But don't just like once and then go in for the pitch without being personalized. If you like it and you actually are engaged with that content, call it out. That's money for your video. So I need to do work there, and that's a piece that I know I need to do. But you're finding content, and so when you see that article that pops up in your feed, great. Put that into your notes in SalesLoft or Outreach and reference it later. And, also, you can I mean, it's really about just engaging with them and reminding them you that you exist, and it's the same with cold calling? I don't look at cold calling as a way that people are gonna actually have conversations. I look at cold calling as a way that people are gonna say, okay. I remember that I looked at my phone and there's this voice message, and I see the transcript, Kayla. Oh, she popped up on my LinkedIn message. Oh, okay. So I have booked a few meetings with the phone, but I think it's about just reminding people that you exist and then hitting them with something really impactful like a video. So you talked about using Outreach and SalesLoft notes, and you're you're doing a great job of time blocking your research. I've heard a lot of SDRs and AEs get lost in they have this massive spreadsheet account of accounts. And whenever they're making a cold call, they're control effing it and trying to figure out, like, oh, shoot. Where's where's this account in my research? And, like, what's my opener supposed to be? So do you have any best practices on where you keep your research and how you keep it all organized? So I keep my research in the notes section in SalesLoft. When I'm making a cold call, I am doing a script that's along the lines of, hey. I'm wondering who's in charge of blank. So it's data science. Or if I know on their profile, I'll be super hyper specific of who's in charge of commercial data science strategy for bioinformatics or actually, that doesn't make sense, but I would say something very specific to what they do. So it's probably they're gonna say that's me. But in terms of really the research, I won't call it out in a lot of other messaging. It's really that first video and then all tie in pieces. I think you need to really if you have a list of a million accounts and you aren't really organized, I would say, let's change your strategy a bit to say, okay, who's our top person at each account who we wanna get in with? Let's focus on that and tier out your people. So maybe you have your top people who your messaging is hyper personalized to. Then you have your second tier, which is still you're speaking to their persona, but it's not really that personalized. But if they have the pain points that your product solved, then most likely they will connect with you and they will take a meeting. Kayla, you mentioned cold calls a second ago. Can you kinda give us a sense? Because I haven't heard people start the call with who's responsible for x. We've heard a lot of, like, the permission based openers and then, leading in context. And so I'm curious, like, what is it what does your cold call look like? Can you give me a sense of the framework? Yeah. So, usually, I'll say, hey. Actually, I had a conversation with someone yesterday at T Mobile, and I said, hey, Mark. Kayla here from yesterday at T Mobile, and I said, hey, Mark. Kayla here from Domino. Wondering who's in charge of data science strategy? And he said, oh, well, that's a really broad question. And then I'll be more specific about what our product does. And so I'm just curious who's in charge of getting models into production, and what does that process look like? And so I'll try to open it with a conversation. At some point, usually, people will feel comfortable enough that they'll give me those names. So he gave me this prospect I talked to gave me two names. You'll ask if you can call out those names and say, hey. Would it be okay if person a if I told person a that you said it was okay for me to reach out? He said no. But then I just got two names of people who are know are the right people, and so I'll set up those meetings. So this is, like, the Justin Michael approach, and I think it works really well. It's less overwhelming for reps because you're not saying, hey. Do you do this? Or you're not directly asking them, and so it takes off the pressure, I think, for reps who are afraid to cold call. So I would say, of all strategies, this is the best strategy I've heard for reps who are afraid of getting on the phone because it doesn't feel like you have that pressure, which is the same pressure that you feel when you're just trying to go in kind of blindsided even with other scripts. So the strategy you just described, you're calling the business and you're trying to get a sense of who the right person is to talk about the thing that you help with. And so the scenario you just described, you were referred to a different contact, but the person who referred you said, no. You can't say that. I said to talk to them. So what does it look like then when you're reaching out to the right person? What do you say? Because you gotta call, email, or video them somehow. So rarely will I I actually just re picked up cold calling. So it's been, like, three or four weeks since I re picked it up because I've been seeing such great results on LinkedIn. But I knew that I needed to practice cold calling again, so I just started picking up the phone. I haven't talked to anyone that says I'm the right person, but when they do say the right person, you say, great. How are you doing blank? So that's really your intro, and it's a very general question. Usually, they're they'll open up. I did have a conversation last week with someone from Aetna, and I said, hey. Who's in charge of data science strategy? Just general. And he said, well, that's a general question. Right? And I said, well, who's in charge of this specific thing? And he said, hey. Reach out to this guy. I'll tell him you're reaching out. And I said, great. Is it okay if I also reach out? I connected with this guy on LinkedIn, sent him a video, booked the meeting, and had the meeting this week. So I think that referral strategy is great, or you go into how are you doing that. Right? You ask them, be curious. I think the problem we see on the phone too often is that people are so robotic, which is when I started out as an SDR, I was the most robotic, horrible person on the phones. And it's just having a conversation, keeping in the back of your mind what your product does, how you can help them in the front of your mind, keeping in, I'm just another human, having a conversation with a human. So when you when you're asking for that referral, there are probably three different outcomes in that. The first is they'll send the email to the right person, which is ideal. The second is you send an email and you say, like, hey. This person's on CC, or I told you to or they told me to reach out. And then the third is, like, hey. Like, I I'm not I'll tell you who it is, but, you know, I'm not gonna actually gonna go and gonna go and refer you. So between the first one and the second one, right, having them send the email or having you send the email, do you think it's worth the time trying to get them to send it for you, or do you prefer just for speed to send it yourself and put them on CC? I prefer to send it myself. I would prefer to connect with someone and send them a quick video. That's just preference. I think people are hesitant to actually send those intros. So I think someone would say, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll send that intro. We'll never send it. So that's why I just usually take it into my own hands. I may say, hey. Would you mind telling me what their email is or asking for more information? But I'll obviously, if they say yes, you can tell them that you I was referred, then I'll call out their name in the title of the email. In general, people will accept my connection request on LinkedIn, so I don't even have to do a title. It just says, hey. I talked to whoever, and I created a one minute video for you. Send them the video and book the meeting. Kayla, we've gotten to the point of the show where we ask the final question, and we've actually changed the final question. So you're on the spot here. The final question is this. We've talked about a lot of things that sales reps can do to be more successful at their jobs related to sales. And so my final question for you is, what is one thing that you do outside of sales that you feel has a tremendous impact on your sales performance? Lifting. So making sure that I get out of my headspace, I can reset, go lift, and making time to go lift or do whatever that activity is. Whether it's a walk, whether it's yoga, whatever fits into your lifestyle, do something and set it on your calendar and say, hey. I'm gonna do this however many days a week and go do it. So you need that time to reset, and that's the most important piece is stepping away from your work. It will always be there coming back refreshed. Boom. I love it. Anything you wanna plug with the audience before we hop off? If you're a sales leader, I'm doing sales enablement for teams around video messaging research, so send me a message. Alrighty. Everybody, send Kayla a message, and everybody, hang on for a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Go lift some weights. Goodbye. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Kayla, Citroen, Thaler include, number one, look at their LinkedIn profile when you're starting that LinkedIn video. Don't just wave your arms around like one of those crazy car dealership floaty thingies. Number two, don't put any notes inside of the connection request. The only way it's gonna increase your chance of connecting is if you are hyper hyper personalized and that is very difficult to scale. Number three, time block everything and that includes the amount of research you do, where you put your notes, and it certainly includes not spending twenty minutes on a LinkedIn video. Three minute rule, max. Number four, use native LinkedIn videos with people that you've connected to who can see your face, they can see your profile. Kayla books 85% of her meetings through video, and the vast majority of those are through LinkedIn, not through cold email. Nick, how can people help us out? So if you're new to the show and you haven't listened to some of our older episodes, we've got some killer content. My recommendation is go back and listen to the very first Playbook episode around how Nick and Armand teach you to cold call. It's one of our most popular episodes. And once you've listened to that, I don't know, stick around for next week's show. Thanks for listening.
