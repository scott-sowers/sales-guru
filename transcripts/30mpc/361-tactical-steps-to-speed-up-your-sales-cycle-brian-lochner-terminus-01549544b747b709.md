## Transcript

Good morning everybody and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my co host Nick Sigelski. Today, we have one of the top account executives at Terminus, Brian Lochner. He's an enterprise account executive closing 6 figure deals, and he's going to walk you step by step through his sales process today. Nick, why should people listen? Brian gets into his company has a SDR qualification call with prospects before he gets to a discovery call. Brian talks through how he makes sure those SDR call calls go well, how he transitions that to discovery, asking them to define specific terms, recommending next steps, using mix tapes as a way to prove value and the rest of the sales process. So this was a great listen, especially if you sell to marketing, sales, or rev ops. And three, two, one. Let's roll. Alright, Brian. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Hey, guys. First tip, as you move through a sales cycle, it's the concept of plotting every stakeholder that you come in contact with on a graph with an x and y axis of competence versus confidence, really creating four quadrants. On your y axis is competence, meaning the buyer's industry know how and their ability. On your x axis, it's gonna be confidence. Confidence can be defined by a buyer's belief in their current situation. How confident are they that their current situation is the best that it can be? Why should you do this? As you multithread through a deal, understanding where all of your stakeholders fall on that graph, champions, influencers, decision makers, that will dictate your approach to the sale. As you look to bring in support from your own team, sales engineer, sales leadership, product or industry experts, it's a great concept to lean on and share with those folks as you prep for certain personas and how to game plan different tactics with your team to tell the right story to the right person in that deal. So example b, you run into a buyer who has high confidence in the space, subject matter that aiming to solve for, but a low confidence level in their team's ability to address the problem today. That's a prospect who's likely open minded and one we wanna talk to all day. We don't have to tailor that pitch too too much. However, buyer with a low confidence but a high sense of confidence for whatever reason, that's more of an uphill battle. Right? It's one that's going to require some major reeducating and challenging of the status quo, very much a different kind of sale. Example of the high confidence, somebody that has high confidence, right, love to bring in our industry experts to talk and be a sounding board for them. I recently brought on a customer where their CEO was heavily involved from the very beginning. The CEO had a strong level of knowledge in account based marketing, the advertising data space, but he knew they didn't have the tools to get them where they needed to go. He was the epitome of high confidence, low confidence. So I brought on our head of digital media strategy, sat back, let them riff. She walked them through a personalized media plan. Later on, as he signed with us, he told us that call was critical in his decision making process. So for each of these quadrants, there's signs you can pick up to be able to place a buyer on the graph, and then there's tactics we can deploy and questions we can ask for each. I keep wanting to make a joke about Arman's competence, but I won't do that. What's number two? Second tip. As soon as you get the feeling that someone is yessing you along, not fully engaged on a call or meeting, call that out. And what I mean by that, a yes man. Right? We've all been there. You're on a call with the buyer, and they're not engaging. Maybe they're yesing you along through the content. There's another strong back and forth dialogue. We have to take a pause, call it out. Oftentimes, when this starts to happen, they're yes ing you, your colleague, like, presenting something, and you've landed on something that is just not resonating. Right? And you see their eyes glaze over. When this happens, I hear this little voice. You're losing them. Right? You have to get in there and and say quick pause, validate. Armand, Nick told me you were doing all of this manually. This is why we pivoted the demo or the conversation in this direction. How does this feel compared to your process today? Or if they're yes ing you, you know, now seeing this feature, curious to hear your take on how you would use this. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Very nice, Brian. What's number three? Yeah. Number three, take advantage of your BDR to AE handoff. Your BDR sets up a meeting. They introduce you to the buyer over email, and they send over a calendar invite. Right? Let's take advantage of that first impression and begin establishing credibility on that first touch. So taking the following steps, LinkedIn invite, connect with them. In that connect invite, include a personal message. Obviously, we're responding to that intro email. In that email, we will include the Zoom link at the top at the top of the message. Call out the LinkedIn connect, and then outline a proposed call agenda. And then ask, what else can we include to make best use of our time together? Maybe call out a couple customers in their space, a case study, something you saw interesting in your pre call research. One thing I often do is check recent job postings. If I see, oh, hey. You guys are hiring for an ABM manager. Looking forward to hearing a little bit more about, that. So, Brian, SDR books a fresh meeting on your calendar. What is the context that you want from your SDRs before you head into that meeting? I wanna know their overall goals and priorities. I wanna know who's going to be joining that meeting. I wanna know their overall timeline. Are we looking at an immediate rollout? Are we looking at three months, six months, a year out? Do they have a incumbent already in place, or is this a brand new kind of rollout for them? And, of course, do they have budget in place? And not just for software, but other components, how much are they spending on media? Does that mean that you guys are running SDR qualification calls in your sales cycle? That is usually the first step before they ever get passed over to the account executives. What are some of the keys, if I'm an SDR, to running a qualification call without burning the lead? Yeah. Absolutely. In account based marketing, we always want to ask the philosophical question. ABM means a lot of things to a lot of different people. How are you thinking about it? Where is this initiative coming from within your organization? If it is a sales led initiative versus a marketing led initiative, that conversation is gonna look very different. And if I know that as an accounting executive going into that conversation, that's gonna be very helpful. What have we tried? What has worked? What hasn't worked? How does the ABM strategy look today? Is it manual? Do we have a platform? Those are the things that I'm gonna want to know heading into that call. So I think it's really important that you're asking the prospect to define that high level term of ABM and saying, hey. This means different things to different people. This is an area that I think a lot of sellers get wrong is they hear these terms and they assume that their understanding of ABM is the same thing as what the customer is thinking. But you can actually do a ton of discovery simply by asking for definition of terms. I I love that. I also think in as we're looking to outline any sort of proposed call agenda, we need to ask, what else can we include to make the best use of our time together? That way, we're setting that expectation. Before we jump into your discovery call, I just wanna understand a little bit more about what the prospect has gone through before they step into your discovery call. Mhmm. How long is a typical SDR qualification call? Are we talking, like, a quick five minute, tell us these basic things? Is it a full thirty minutes? And then it basically feels like another thirty minute discovery call. What does a call actually look like? Yeah. It's certainly the balancing act that we've done a lot of experimentation with at Terminus. It used to be that it was just over email, And then we found that we needed to have some of that face to face. We wouldn't gather all the information that we need to make sure that first call with the AE is gonna be a home run. So right now, as it stands today, fifteen minutes. They're running them through the band, running through through the typical discovery questions. And in that call, how much quote unquote selling is done? Because I imagine a lot of this might feel like taking to a prospect. Right? You're asking me about my timeline. You're asking me about my budget and all of that stuff. But I probably click the request a demo button, and I wanna get a little bit out of this thing. So how do you oftentimes have your SDRs balance that without taking over the AE job? Yeah. I think it's all about setting that up front contract with them. This is what our ADRs do really well, explaining right off the bat, what is the goal of this call? We've also experimented with flashing up a couple slides. We wanna give them a taste, but really we want to sell that discovery call. We certainly don't wanna sell them on Terminus on that on that ADR. Can you voice over what that upfront contract sounds like? And then maybe also what the selling of the discovery call sounds. We haven't had many people talk about this process, and I think this would be really good for the listeners to hear. One thing that I lean into is, you know, I say, well, what we'll do today, we'd love to hear a little bit more about what brought you to Terminus, then diving deeper, better understand some of those goals, how you are thinking about an account based deployment. We'll give you some context as to where Terminus, as an ABM leader, where we play in the space. Now I know we just have a few minutes blocked off here today, so we'll see how far we get. Eventually, we'll wanna give you a peek at the platform, show you a demo. I can show you some screenshots today. But if things resonate, we can put together more of a custom platform demonstration. How does that sound for a game plan? Great. So let's talk about what happens on the next call. Oftentimes, where I've seen qualification calls go wrong is they get a sense of this is what ABM means to me. This is what timeline looks like to you. This is what budget looks like for us. And then they get on to the next call, and they ask the exact same questions that were asked on the qualification call. So how do you take the information that the SDR gives you and hit the ground running in your discovery call? One of the slides that I like to share, is what we call a revenue flywheel. What it shows is ABM can impact and influence five different stages of the fall as we think about impacting how prospects look to build awareness or build pipeline, accelerating pipeline in your sales team cycles, and then helping post sell, helping with retention efforts and expansion opportunities. Based on what you had told my BBR, it sounded like top of funnel, building awareness and pipeline, increasing SQLs and new opportunities. That's kind of the focus. Does that sound right to you? And that's where I start leaning in and asking more of those metrics questions? In terms of metrics, always like to know where you're coming from. Let's say you bought Terminus tomorrow. You're immediately more efficient. You have some intent data. You're running super strong ads. And a year later, you're like, wow. That was the best decision we made this year in marketing. What metrics do you think would make that a home run for you? What is the goal? Right? Leads, new opportunities created, any other metric that you might be thinking about? And then once we understand kind of those metrics that is kind of our North Star, well, then we can get into the process, how we integrate the two technologies, and how they can start activating through the platform. That's an approach that I've taken a lot, which is basically asking the customer, what does success look like? Let's say we partner together, we do this, we get six, seven, eight months down the road. Talk to me about the outcomes that you're looking to accomplish because I wanna make sure that we're both pointed in the right direction. And what I found when I asked that question, especially one of the things that I'll do with that technique, Brian, is I'll actually pull up a PowerPoint slide with a blank slide, and I found that's an awesome way to get the customer talking to you about where they are looking to end up, which is their desired future state. And so if you understand what's going on today and where they're looking to go, now the way that you're selling whatever you sell, you're simply explaining, hey. Here's how we get from point a where you are now to that desired future state. What a lot of salespeople do is they ask the customer, you're looking for a law firm practice management platform. Talk to me about what you need in that platform. Talk to me about what features you want. Do you wanna have paperless billing? Do you wanna have profitability analysis? What do you need in the thing? Versus saying, what are you looking to accomplish? And then when you sell, you're just explaining how your thing takes them to the promised land they're looking to get to. So it's a really great technique. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. So, Brian, I imagine one challenge with this approach is you're talking about big metrics and outcomes. And let's say you're meeting with a director of marketing or rev ops, and they're like, this is all great, but I I I wanna talk about the use cases. Like can you identify these types of prospects who are showing these types of intense signals? It's hard for them to talk about the big picture metrics when they don't really feel like the problems they wanna solve are real yet. What do you do when a prospect is trying to pull you down into the weeds of the solution as opposed to talking about the outcomes first? I always like to start by saying, from a metric standpoint, ABM can take some time to rev up rather than instant gratification, like a traditional lead gen. So we wanna set the right expectations. As we continue the evaluation, hopefully, what you begin to feel is that we're building out a lot of the strategy with you along the way. That way you aren't buying software and hoping that's your strategy. Right? Because that's what we see customers do and frankly, not always great on retention rates. What we wanna help be prescriptive along the way, That way we can say, okay. We stood this up tomorrow. What are we gonna do first? What campaigns, tactics, accounts are we gonna go after and attack? We can hit the ground running. So we had the legendary KD Kevin Dorsey on the other day, and he talks about turning wants into whys. So in other words, when a prospect says that they want something, you need to figure out why that even matters. And this will oftentimes happen when I'm doing consulting for early stage founders. They'll say, I want to get a better outbound drip. But the why behind that is because they oftentimes don't have enough pipeline or they're not closing enough deals. But I don't know if their diagnosis is right. Because oftentimes, once I start to work my way up in their pipeline, and and I'm like, okay. Why is outbound important? How many meetings are you getting a day? How many meetings are you getting a month? How much pipeline is that leading to? I look at it. I'm like, you're actually generating a lot of pipeline. You're just not closing anything. And so in order for you to actually properly prescribe a solution, you can't take their prescription. You have to go all the way to the why, which is usually a higher business driver first. So, Brian, let's say that they're like, we really wanna have top of funnel pipeline generation. That's the biggest reason that we want ABM. How do you transition from that over to the solution that you're helping them solve? There's many tactics that we will use in order to impact those revenue goals a quarter out, two quarters out. But what we wanna know is what is that North Star? What kind of pipe coverage are we looking for? And it waterfalls from there. How many opportunities is that? How many sales meetings will that take? How many people do we need to engage to get to that amount of meetings? And the way that we're engaging with them is through, at Terminus, our activation channels, engagement channels like ads, account based chatbot, our web personalization tool, email signature, banners, and also activating the sales team. How do you expand your prospects definition of where Terminus can help? Because I'm looking on the site and there's a bunch of different things. You do create awareness, build pipeline, accelerate pipeline, retain customers, expand customers. My guess is when you meet with somebody, they don't say, I want to do all five of those things. To what extent do you say you want to build awareness and build pipeline, but we can also help over here or is that a we'd rather land and expand? Yeah. Absolutely. Every vendor in this space provides a similar service when it comes to serving up the data, showing you intent, who's hitting your website. Mhmm. The question very quickly becomes, what are we doing with this data? How are we activating sales and marketing? We can show you the sales activation piece. But when we start thinking about the activation channels for marketing that will provide sales air cover actionability, I think that's where you'll find Terminus begins to separate itself through different channels, like programmatic ads and other activation channels. When you think about advertising, maximizing your media spend, and other channel activation, if that's top priority, I think that's where you're gonna find Terminus to be a compelling solution. You were telling me on the preshow that you've got, like, a four month sales cycle. And my guess is the steps in that sales cycle are not just SDR qualification call, Brian does some discovery, show a demo, deal closed. My guess is there's more some more complexity to things. And at some point, you have to explain to your customer, hey. Here's all the things that need to happen for you to do a proper evaluation. How do you actually explain all of those steps to your customer? How do you give them a sense of what the journey is gonna look like? I do actually think this is a pitfall and kind of a bad habit that some sellers should look to break is every decently run sales organization has an ingrained training and enablement that sales knows, okay, this is our sales process where it's, okay, we've done step two, three, or say step seven, and now we head to step eight. Rarely am I working a deal that perfectly aligns with my prospect's process. You have to understand the components of your own sales process, but then flex them to meet the prospect in their journey. You're still covering everything, but breaking the habit of forcing clients into your own deal cycle. But not every deal is gonna be linear. When we have multiple stakeholders, when we're selling larger deals with more products, you're hopping around the process a bit to make it easy for your customer to buy. So when I'm looking to end calls, you know, always start by saying, hey, Nick. Appreciate the time today. Appreciate the engagement. Hope you all have a great rest of your week. Was that the right level of detail you wanted to get out of today, understanding timeline, and then being prescriptive as we start thinking about next steps? I like to say my recommendation is that we look to loop in x y z individual from your team. Maybe we can check out CRM integration. We can start speaking about onboarding, expectations, timelines, and then, of course, start getting into the financials, setting a a strong proposal. How does that align with your current process? So you have call 0, which is qualification call. Budget, timeline, what ABM use case are we even talking about? You have call one, which is the discovery call, which is understanding the problem, the impact of the problem, probably a couple of high level ways that you can solve for that. What is the next call after that look like? Usually, right after that is going to be more of a custom platform demo where we would look to use maybe some of the client's own data. Maybe they'll send us some of their target account list. We can run a match test to actually see how effective our advertising efforts can be our reach. We can also look to run an intent exercise out of your target accounts. Which of them are already leaning in, showing buying signals? We wanna give them a little taste as we walk through that demo using their real live data. That's generally what that next call looks like. From there, we would then look to maybe build out a media proposal plan. Now that we have their target account data, we know our exact reach, we know how strong our capabilities are gonna be for them. We can give them a solid idea of how much you guys should probably be spending to accomplish some of those goals you told me. The account match thing is a really great thing if you sell any sort of advertising. It's something we do at thirty minutes to presidents club. When I'm talking to a prospective sponsor, I will frequently ask them to send me their target account list, and we will match it against our audience database to validate whether or not the people they want to be getting in front of are indeed the people they would be getting in front of. And what this does is for competitors who don't have the capability to do an account match, we basically ice them out because now the advertisers wait. What? You can't do that? And 30 MPC can. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Brian, could you share a little bit more color for the audience, especially for folks who might not be as familiar with what Terminus exactly does? How do you construct a match test, and maybe how would sellers do something similar in their own sales cycle? Absolutely. So what a match test is, that is gonna be one component of an overall, what we call, engagement assessment. It's something we regularly conduct to just better understand how the the Terminus solution can be for our customers before moving forward with a paid partnership. So that includes match test intent exercise, sometimes a web engagement analysis. Great way to prove out the kind of value Terminus can bring a, b, c company prior to moving forward. Yeah. Something we do very often. So with a match test, if you have a list of target accounts, we would love to be able to take that list, run it through a test. This helps us gauge our advertising reach. Specifically, we test cookie data that we have associated with specific department, seniority levels that you wanna target. We run an IP test to understand what our reach might be within accounts based side of North America. And all that's needed to run a match test from a client is the accounts and the URLs. And then you just tell us what kind of stakeholders you want to target. Got it. And so what it's doing is it's basically saying, let's make this real. We're not just saying, these are the types of intent signals that Terminus can show you. We're saying for your 10 accounts, these are the literal intent signals that we are going to show you on this CFO that you're trying to get in front of today, for instance. And that is something that a lot of sellers fall short of in their demo process is there are different scales to a demo. There's a standard demo, and a standard demo is just dummy data. There's a custom demo, which I find is the most underutilized form of demo. I have another customer named Covey. And basically, what they do is they have an AI robot that will screen thousands of job resumes in seconds. So they'll show you the five applicants worth talking to. For their custom demo, they plug into one of your job applications and screen a thousand resumes. It doesn't take much more work. You're not setting up an entire proof of concept multi week trial with exit criteria. You're showing the solution in their reality instead of a hypothetical reality. So there's an in between demo between standard demo and proof of concept, and that is the custom demo. I think that's the most underutilized type of demo. Yeah. I mean, Arman, if I go back to how I sell thirty minutes to presidents club sponsorships, it's one thing for me to say, we're gonna run a lot of ads on the show. It's another for me to voice over what I think I'm gonna say in the ads. And what you do is you go from, we're gonna do this thing, to showing the customer what they're going to get. You connect the dots between your offering and what it means for them. You're giving them context, and that's really powerful in the eyes of a prospect. And not to mention, it's a great way to mutually start building the business case as they're looking to sell this internally. Right? As we have an actual score, we can compare that to industry standard, and we can confidently say, based on these results, we have confidence in a partnership when it comes to having the targeting capabilities, coverage for your target accounts to proactively get in front of the right audiences, drive more business for you. What does the Brian Lochner business case formula look like? And I hope it is not the $7,000,000 ROI stack of bullshit that most business cases look like. Usually pairing case studies with the engagement assessment, telling that story with that custom demo, having that all recorded, boxing that up and and shipping that to my client. So your business case you're saying is case study, some of that demo data where it's really like the custom demo, you're recording it, boxing it up. What goes into the boxing it up? Are you editing a video? Or what does that look like? Absolutely. So I feel the most valuable license I have as a as a salesperson is my Goggle license. Right? And I am chopping up snippets to align that as I am outlining key takeaways, objectives, goals. This is exactly where we are going to be able to have some immediate impact. And then leaning into third party analysts through Forrester. Right? Leaning in on those power users that are using Terminus that you can see those reviews on g two. I always look to include those as well. Those snippets are so powerful. To the When I sold to law firms, we would go through eight hour demos with an entire law firm's accounting department. We'd do an hour for the AP department, an hour for the analysis department, an hour for the AR department. And so I'll tell you who was not in that eight hour meeting was the managing partner of the law firm, the person who would ultimately make the decision and sign the check. But that person needed some way to understand the value of what we did, and usually needed to see some degree of the product. And so in those eight hours of demoing, there would usually be a couple highlight moments where the AP person goes, oh my gosh, this is gonna save me literally two hours a day. I was taking that thirty second snippet and stitching them all together for a demo highlight reel. So the managing partner in three minutes could see all of the highs of the demo. Most salespeople do is they send, hey, here's the call recording, and they send the whole thing over, which I promise you your buyer is not forwarding around, and the people who actually make decisions are not watching your ninety minute recording. So you're doing mostly it sounds like business drivers and things like that. I would think that of anyone like Terminus ABM, it would be like, okay. This much more account penetration, this many more meetings, things like that. It always sounds a lot simpler than it is. So what I've seen done from some other folks in the space is having these ROI calculators. And for myself, that gives me the Right? I don't know what formula is going into those calculators. Right? So what our focus is, what we prioritize is that engagement assessment using their real data, their accounts. There's no BS ing these numbers. We know what our exact reach is into these accounts. And then we can also put a tracking pixel on their site so we can monitor real time site engagement and say, hey. These are the accounts visiting your site. We're not personalizing the site to help convert that traffic, drive more form fills, and and downloads. And we're also not retargeting those folks because we don't know who those folks are. Well, Brian, the clock is ticking. We gotta move to the final question, which is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? You know, every decently run sales organization has an ingrained training, enablement, sales know how. Right? This is our sales process. We've done step seven and now step eight, but so rarely am I working a deal that perfectly aligns with my prospect's process. You have to greatly understand the components of your own sales process, but then flex them to meet the prospect in their journey. You're still covering everything, but break in the habit of forcing clients into your kill cycle. Not every deal is linear. When you have multiple stakeholders selling larger deals with products, you're hopping around the process a bit to make it easy for your customer to buy. And that's the name of the game. Brian, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, make it's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Brian Lochner. What do you have for your two? Number one is the mix tape. Do not just send the full sixty minute demo recording to your prospect. Instead, take the snippets of the highlights of the demo and send the snippets in very short form to your prospect to help them more easily share it with people. Because I promise folks are not watching the sixty minute recording, but they will watch a sixty second recording. Number two is ask your prospect to define vague terms. If they say things like ABM, well, that means different things to different people. Help me understand what that means to you specifically.
