## Transcript

You can't expect to run-in person meetings at conferences and trade shows the same way that you run virtual meetings via Zoom. If you do that, you'll have a bunch of really great conversations with prospects, but then you will spend weeks and weeks and weeks playing chase with prospects that don't ever end up turning into opportunities or deals. Today, I'm gonna talk about how you should be running in person meetings at events and trade shows. I'm gonna talk about how to make sure that you don't let logistics structuring those meetings, and then I'll talk about how you should be wrapping those meetings so that you actually get an opportunity created, not just a great conversation. So with that said, let's roll the tape. Let's get into this thing. So the first piece and the worst piece is when you let meeting logistics spoil the fun of your in person meetings. In general, you should expect there to be a decent amount of friction getting to your in person meeting and running the in person meeting. Number one, expect that transit is going to take longer than you expected. You're gonna call an Uber and think, oh, it'll just take five minutes for it to show up, and it'll turn out there are no Ubers available for twenty minutes. Know that that's gonna happen and plan ahead. Ahead. You should also expect that your prospect won't be able to find you. So the day of what I like to do is I will email them and I'll say, Hey, in case we can't find each other, here's my cell phone. Call me. Great. Now they have your number and you can make sure there's not a missed connection because they didn't see you sitting in the corner somewhere. Speaking of where you're sitting, where you schedule the meeting actually matters. You don't want to plan to meet prospects at noisy, like, bar, happy hour networking events. It's so easy at those to get interrupted by other people. You can't really have a business conversation at the big happy hour like networking events. So plan, I like to go to a coffee shop or I like to meet in an exhibit hall in a back room where you can actually sit down and have a face to face real conversation. So do all of those things to make sure when you actually get to the meeting, there's no stress, there's no hassle, and there's no interruption. Let's talk about the structure of these in person meetings because I said you can't run them the same way you run a virtual meeting. Things that are similar, however, is you still want to do a time check. If you're scheduled for thirty minutes, say, hey. Just so I make sure we're we're on the same page, I've got us down for thirty minutes, which puts us at a stop at one. Are you still good for that or do you need me to watch the clock for something sooner? Nope. Great. I'm good for that. Cool. Great. Now what I do there is I'm actually gonna set a timer on my phone and I'll tell them, hey, I'll set a timer to go off audibly at the twenty five minute mark so that you're not late to your next one. Great. You respect their time. They're not looking at their phone to check the time. You're not doing the same. Now what you want to do is set the stage by setting an agenda. You know, the reason that I wanted to meet with you or the reason that I thought we should sit down today or in terms of what I thought the agenda for today's meeting would be, you've got to say a phrase like that to make sure that you are communicating that you have a plan for what the meeting is going to be. Once you've done that, it's important that you find ways to steer the conversation towards business. In person meetings in particular have a tendency to skew towards the fluffy rapport building for the entirety of them and you don't want that. You actually want to have a real business conversation where you start to uncover problems, you start to uncover opportunities and initiatives that their company is focused on. I recommend leaning on certain phrases like, you know, part of the reason that I wanted to meet with you was I thought you all might be interested in ABC functionality that you have or, hey, you know, part of the reason that I wanted to meet was usually when I'm sitting down with a CFO, they tell me that they're focused on solving x problem, and I'm wondering, is that something you all are focused on? Keep in mind, x problem is usually a big problem that you can help solve for them. You want to present problems. You want to keep steering the in person meeting towards business, towards problems, toward opportunities, as opposed to, oh, yeah. What's your take on this event? How many years have you been? Oh, cool. Who else are you gonna be meeting? Avoid that stuff. Get to the business problems. And then the last piece here, I lied earlier. If you have thirty minutes, you should probably set your timer to go off at the twenty minute mark because you wanna carve out more time than you normally would to talk about next steps. You got to keep in mind that just because you're sitting down and meeting with the person who physically came to the conference, that doesn't mean that that's a person you should be navigating the whole opportunity with. There might be other people in the organization that you should be talking to. At the end, I usually recommend you wrap by saying, you know, I feel like there might be something here and it might be worth us continuing to explore working together. What's your take on things? First pulse check. Do they even wanna talk about working together more? If they say yes, that's when you can transition to talking about how you'll navigate working together. Who else should you be talking to? See if you can get introductions made to those people. Then you should be thinking about what the next step should be. Ideally, you're the one making a recommendation. I love the word recommendation. You might say, say, you know, do you mind if I give you a recommendation in terms of what we do next? Prospect will almost always say yes. And then you can present, is it a demo? Is it a meeting with another stakeholder, etcetera? And then the last piece at the end, if you're gonna be meeting with this person again, you should be aiming to get on the calendar there. Do not say, cool. I'll email you next week. We can schedule a time for a demo. If they're interested in seeing a demo, get on the calendar there. Pull out your phone. Open the calendar app and get time on the books then. Know that you can always reschedule and share that with the prospect. Hey, why don't we pencil some time and if we end up having craziness after this, we can always reschedule and move. But get on the calendar because it's that gap between conference deals go to die. So spend an inordinate amount of time on the next steps, especially with these in person meetings. And part of the reason that I said that you should end at the twenty minute mark is you should always aim to end on a high note and give some time back to your prospect. You don't wanna come across as the really meaty salesperson who's clinging to every second with them. Try to end a little bit early because you demonstrate, I'm here to meet a lot of people also. We should probably wrap this thing and we both can get to our next one. So that's how you should be running your in person meetings at these conferences. As a reminder, the big three takeaways, don't let logistics spoil the fun, run the meetings similar to how you'd run a virtual one where you set an agenda, but make sure you steer the conversation consistently towards business. And then end those meetings five minutes early, ten minutes early, so you can talk about next steps, and you can both end on a high note and get to your next one. That's it. That's how you run a killer in person meeting. Thanks Thanks for watching, and we'll see you on the next video.
