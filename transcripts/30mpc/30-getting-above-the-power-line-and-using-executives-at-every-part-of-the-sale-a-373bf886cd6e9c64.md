## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my co host Nick Skalski. And today, we have the CEO of Gong. Yes. The CEO of gong.io, Amit Bhandoff. No further introduction needed. Why should people listen, Nick? Do I need to say anything more? But on today's show, we cover some really interesting things about selling to executives, leveraging your own executives to sell, and using interesting things like an NDA to get to power. Listen to this one. Oh, and lastly, if you thought Amit didn't have it anymore because he's a CEO and maybe he might not be able to sell anymore, you are horribly mistaken. This man is a heck of a salesperson, and so this is just as actionable as any other episode. Three, two, one. Hit the gong. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Amit. Welcome to thirty minutes to presidents club. You know we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. Number one, bigger isn't always harder. So sometimes it's not much harder to sell, like, a larger deal. If we sell it for, like, 10,000, probably, like, 20,000 because the same ballpark of effort. And sometimes, like, 200,000 is easier because it gets a negotiation, like, higher authority and things could actually go a lot faster. Very cool. What's number two? Number two, how do you use your executives to, help you open and close a deal? First, it's great to use them to door opening. I mean, they have, like, board connection. They could, like, pair a suit right at the top. Second, like, throughout the process, maybe, like, communicate, like, vision of the company and and, like, commitment to the partnership. And three, kinda to help, like, close the deal, show respect and commitment, and make the customer feel good about the, the ongoing partnership. There's a flip side of that, like, we're not to use like, if the deal is, like, going south, right, and you don't know to explain why we should buy from you and not from the other guys or why they should pay you, like, your CEO probably can't help you. You need to know and then, like, use them to kinda, like, help provide tailwinds. Beautiful. What's the last one to meet? The last one at first, like, is crucial, especially, like, in b two b that you, like, work, like, multiple contacts. Like, if you're talking, like, one or two people, the odds of you closing the deal are pretty slim. So just check. And as a teaser, you know, the big question, how do you get to, like, the higher ups? How do you navigate your app? How do you get to, like, more contact with the organization? But that's probably what we're gonna be talking like down the road. Right? Let's do it. So I feel really awkward because one of the things that I don't wanna do is I don't wanna go to one of your reps when we're looking at buying Gong and Meat and say, like, hey. I know you're important here, but can I go talk to your CEO, Amit? And so what is the way that won't piss anybody off to properly ask for access to power? There's there's a number of ways to do it, and let's try to go over them. So first, like, I mean, let's like, the way you ask you, like, would it be okay if I go to the CEO? Like, you're gonna get a no. Like, almost certainly, like, our CEO is busy. He doesn't this is like I'm doing. So one way to do it, like, suppose that you like what you see, like, besides you, who else would need to authorize this? Right? Now you're you're respectful and he needs to tell you the truth. Right? So now you could kinda, like, agree that, yeah, you're you're the decision maker, but there there are the others. But there are other ways to do it. Right? Which are kinda, like, a little more tricky. Right? So one, sometimes, like, you can ask them to sign an agreement. It could be as simple as an NDA. Right? You said to do that, we'll need to sign an NDA. Now you know what you need to get with someone who's, like, at least, like, maybe not the CEO, but someone who's, like, an authority to sign. So this is artificial. Something charging for stuff. Like, if there's a POC or a study or an evaluation, just charging helps you get to other people in your organization that actually can authorize a purchase or any expense. Sometimes if you go back to, like, quote number two, how do you, use your your CEO or a CRO, whatever that is, says, listen. My my CEO is psyched about the deal with your company. He's he's begging you to speak with your CEO. You think they're what are the odds of getting these guys connected? Right? So now it's like par speaking of the same level par, you're not, like, going and you're not belittling his or her importance. So, Amit, I imagine that there are times when somebody's selling something to Gong. They'll use some of these approaches, and you'll be pulled into the deal. And my guess is when you've gotten to a point where Gong is seriously considering buying something to the point that you're pulled into the conversation, it's not meeting number one. It's not even meeting number two. The the sale has gotten fairly deep into the process, and you need to be briefed on what's happening. And so I'm curious from your perspective, Have you seen sales reps do that well when you come into a deal and you need to get some context for the conversation they've had with your organization? And if so, how? The advice is, like, get to the point. And I do it sometimes, like, even in the company, people, like, present a business case for something. It's, like, you know, 20 slides, and that's that's all good. But I would do the thing just, you know, okay. Can I see the last slide? Like, start the last slide. If we agree on that, I don't need to see the rest. Right? We're done. Right? And then I might have some questions, but just start, like, why should I care? And, like, I mean, this could really, like, increase sales productivity by 13% with things like, you know, $1,700,000 of saving next year. This is, like, $250,000 investment. It's been used by to now, like, value and then, like, risk. This has been using by by, you know, 20 other companies like us. They're writing about it. This company is legit. I recommend that we do it. So first, like, value and second, like, address, like, the risk and the, the concerns. Simple as that. And I find that that's where a lot of times reps will get screwed up as we talked about getting above the power line or getting to power. Oftentimes, what happens is if you start at power and you start going and trying to sell something to a meet and you start going into the demo and showing them every single nook and cranny of your spreadsheet, a meet's gonna kick it down. Right? You're gonna kick it down below power because you're like, this is too in the weeds for me. So you gotta you gotta start with the so what, but at the same time, like, you need to get that stuff done. So you talked about multithreading a deal and how multithreading a deal is going to make sure that, like, you have a higher close ratio. So could you walk us through, like, how do you artfully multithread a deal without feeling like you're just, like, hopping all over the organization all over the place? So first, like, know, like, who your real buyer is and try to get kinda the the lowest ranking person who can actually, like, make a purchase decision. Right? So one of my companies, we're like I mean, we're starting, like, pitch to CIOs, and we're getting their attention. We're like they'd be happy to talk to us, but I noticed that every time they have kinda, like, delegate us to the application director because they weren't really the decision makers. It's not decision they're capable of making. Right? Just through technical and they would not force people to buy. So we actually said, okay. We're gonna start selling to the IT directors in our domain and actually, like, shave, like, two weeks from the sales cycle because we got the person who can make the they have the budget. They can do it. They're supportive. We're wasting our time as CEO. So just kind of the lowest ranking person, they're easier to get to. Right? But they can make the purchase. Second, it's easier to go, like, top down than bottom up. I mean, it's it's harder to get to these people. Right? But once you do it, kind of, the whole sales cycle and and they may say, like, okay. Yeah. You're working with my team on that. But once the team already got, they know that you were talking. They know that they kinda have, like, a at least kinda, like, a high level blessing that, yeah, this is something that I I think is at least interesting. The whole sales cycle takes, like, a different place. Understand, like, who needs to be, like, typical. So people talk about, like, ICP. It's, like, one person. But think about the whole, like, ICP is a ideal customer team profile. Right? Who's, like who would need to be it's like, is it securities? Is it IT? Is it finance? Just try to map kinda like older people and be proactive about it. Because usually these people are involved in a decision. Like, if we assuming if you have come again, timeline for the project and some sense of urgency, like, I would recommend that these are the people who are usually involved. Let's involve them early so they're definitely legal. Right? It's harder to navigate up for the reason that we mentioned. So I think we wanna block you. They don't wanna, like, monitor their boss. And but if you start from the top, it's easier. The one thing I wanna go back to is one of the things you talked about is, like, to get to power, it's very unconventional. Usually, you think to accelerate a deal, you wanna discount a deal. Right? You you wanna drop the price so it can close quicker. But you're actually saying you should be raising price to accelerate a deal. Could you walk us through, like, what that is and and why you do it? If low pricing creates like low commitment on a customer side let's say if you set something for five dollars and, you know, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't work. Nobody cares. It's very easy to write it off. Right? But once the stakes are higher, people take it more seriously. So they're more much more likely to get a successful customer. Right? And again, I don't know if, like, high for is, like, 10,000 or a 100 or a million. Right? But so that's one thing. Second, it's the the people that need to authorize. Right? Because sometimes people that can purchase for 10,000 might not be senior enough in your organization to actually promote your project or your your your sales initiative out there. So I actually like raising the price, you kinda force a discussion with the higher ops. Alright? But, of course, your value proposition message has to be aligned. It's not the same thing that they're buying. They're not buying a product. They're not buying technology. Some kind of, like, higher order value proposition that will resonate well with the buyers. So, Amit, I wanna flip on our head one of the things we talked about earlier. We talked about when we're going in and we're selling to an executive, and you shared a bit about your perspective of when your organization is being sold to. I wanna talk a little about leveraging our own executives to to help us as salespeople. And so you sort of alluded to in the beginning, there's really three stages that you might bring in an executive. You've got the early stage, to open up a deal. You've got the middle stage, and then you've kinda got the end where you're solidifying it. And so I wanna get your sense on what's the best way to prepare an executive to come in to meet with your prospects so that they can have an effective conversation and help you sell. Yeah. Super important. And and, unfortunately, the big gong thing is she's using it pretty effectively and I get, like, a brief and sometime on important deals, we'll schedule, like, a meeting just to prepare. Come prepared. Right? It's not not just the niceties and, you know, my title is the CEO. You You gotta stand. So who are you meeting with? What is their background? Kinda like recent context. What is their attitude like? Are they like fans, skeptics, or, like, actually, like, hate the idea. Right? Three, kinda like Google business context for the customer is always helpful. Understand, like, are they, like, growing? Are they, like, stuck somewhere? Is there, like, a recent like, our team actually, like, reads, like, poorly, earnings report when the company is actually starting to select what are the top issues for the company. Even SDRs for outbound. Finally, kinda, like, what's the value proposition? Right? And all the everything so far is in context, but why do you think they should buy? Right? Where is the value? And, again, it's not kind of the usually not the functionality. It's kinda like, this is what we're trying to accomplish as a business, and this is why this is what we do for them. So you you've gotta know that. Okay. And so now let's say the rep has brought you on to a call. What do those calls look like? Are you bringing are the reps bringing in a solutions engineer? Are they bringing on other people? What does the audience look like when you're involving an executive in a customer call, both on the internal and external side? Sometimes the best ones are the ones who's just like we wanna watch. So that we just be and like the other CEO or CRO or whatever buyer is. And the point is more of us are kind of create a relationship. Right? You're not even like trying to sell. You're trying to get to know each other and that's what they really want. You're not necessarily selling the product. It's getting a closer relationship. Essentially, they're gonna make, like, a big bet for you. They wanna make sure that they have access to someone who can help them if things don't work well or someone is committed. So I think that it's more about, like, creating a relationship. Sometimes for some of the meetings, there is a more structured agenda. Right? That is like, here's what we understand. Kinda for me, it could be like, strategic vision of the company. Right? Again, it's like they're making a bet on the long term partner, like, especially so the one in there were, like, where is here's what I'm buying today, but where is this gonna be, like, in a year, in two years, and in three years? Answer any question that they might have. So they ask, like, you know, what concerns do you have so they can hear it from me. Alright. So I can, I can address them? But that's, like, mostly it's about, like, who the companies make them feel comfortable with partnering with you. I'd love that you mentioned that because the first time I ever brought the CEO of my company into a customer deal, my CEO met up with the CEO of this customer I was selling to, and they met up for lunch in a city that I wasn't even in at the time, and I wasn't there. So all I did was make the lunch reservation, and I remember being really nervous that, like, how do I know they're going to do the right thing and he like, my CEO is gonna talk about the right thing. And so when I got a report afterwards, he was like, yeah. We talked about how we grew up in the same part of the country for about forty five minutes, and we talked business for five or ten minutes. But the relationship was so powerful that my CEO even helped us do some things internally to win the deal. And so it was almost like they sold each other on working together as opposed to just a a slide deck. So, Amit, one of the things that I'm sure you get brought into all the time is you mentioned in the prep call that you'll say no to deals sometimes. You say this customer isn't a fit for us for one reason or another. And a lot of times where we see reps bringing in the CEO is if there's something that we don't have built yet, that we need to get the customer to agree to, and we need to get them to buy into something that we're promising them that we'll eventually have. And so do you have any do's or don'ts or way of thinking about, like, hey. A customer is asking for this, and we don't have it. How should we frame that and set expectations with them on whether or not we can deliver there? We don't sell road map. Like, for strategic customers, we will say, like, these are the plans, but very it's never like it never gets to a situation where, like, you need these we say, like, you know, we estimate that we might have it by this, but recognize it's not like a contractual commitment, something that we don't have. So very upfront. We try to stick to what we have right now. That's what people buy. And I find, personally, it's, like, it's a healthier approach, like, kinda long term. You might lose a deal sometime, but that's actually, like, the right thing to do. Well, Amit, this has been a a phenomenal question. We ask one question to every single guest every time. And And so we talked about a lot of good habits that reps have. We talked about multithreading deals, getting the power, even raising your price to get to power. But there are oftentimes some things that Gong is pointing out. And so if there was one bad habit that every single rep had to break today, what would it be? Just don't overtalk yourself. Right? Just people tend to, like, talk too much. You see, I'm I'm being self aware. I mean, that's gonna suck if I'm talking too much, but just become, like, a better listener is important. I mean, not that's all, like, a lot of other things. Well, everybody, you gotta listen up for Amit's last word here. And, Amit, is there anything else you wanna plug or chime in with the audience before we jump off here? I mean, do I get should I say, like, bygone or something? Yes. This is your moment. By Gong. Blog. Yeah. I mean, my team would be upset if I if I didn't mention it. Yeah. Check us out. There are actually a lot of tips on our in our in our blog. So all the Gong Labs, little data points that are multi threading and and, like, how to become ask better questions, and then they get your way out there. It's, like, real science based data. So I I'm checking it out. It's really good. Well, let me I'm actually curious. And, Arman, I wanna take us for a second off the script because you guys really do puts out out some interesting data. Is there anything recently that you've seen from a data perspective where you said, oh, I'm actually surprised by that that you think listeners should know about? I'm not surprised. I mean, sometimes you have to be surprised with kinda, like, the data validates things that you know, but in in quantifies. So I think they're pushing now. Like, we got a lot of question like, you know, should I turn my camera on or not? Or how important it is? So the question is like it's actually like your odds of winning are actually double if the camera is on. Off? On. Oh, on. I was like, oh, gosh. On. And if you wear a Hawaiian shirt, like, it's like just kidding. You can look for that one. But, yeah. Definitely try to keep the camera on. I know sometimes it's hard to, there like, there's a good discussion. Like, should you know, we ask the prospect to do it. I think you should, but not push. Just, hey. This is a video conference with a camera. That's great. Sometimes people don't feel comfortable. Right? They might have, like, he's running around or, you know, the hair isn't done or or something. So but, I mean, it's it's good. If you if you do it, it increases your likelihood of winning. That's how you connect with people, right, on an emotional level. Just facial expressions, and they see that you're a real person and you're nice and you're good looking or whatever. So, yeah. Bring it on. Armand and I have negative marks in that that department. It causes lost deals. Well, hey. This has been a blast of a conversation. Is there anything else you wanna cover before we jump off here? No. Thanks for inviting me, and I hope it was, good. And, good luck to all of you. And I don't don't send me, like, emails, like, all of you, like, next week trying to trying to get or something with all those things. Well, nobody harass Amit with all of your cold emails, but absolutely the best sales blog that I've personally seen out there. Amazing data, amazing insights, and a a world class sales team.

Your top four takeaways from this episode with Amit Bhandav include, number one, one tricky way to get to power is ask somebody to sign an NDA. It has to go to somebody who has some power to make some decisions. Number two, one of the things that you think about when getting to power and also multi threading deals is try to find the lowest ranking person who can still make a purchasing decision. Because going to the CEO, the CEO can't just tell finance what's due. Okay. Number three, you gotta raise prices to get the power. Crazy. Raise prices is going to get your attention from the executives. It's gonna get the attention from the board. And then lastly, number four, use your execs at all points of the deal cycle. Bring them in early to get exec by them, to show them that you're gonna get the best service. Bring them in late in the deal so that they have full confidence that you're gonna be giving them the best possible service. And then, of course, try not to bring them in only when a deal is going south because there's only so much they can do. Nick, how can people help us out here? Alrighty, guys. So we asked for it on the last show, but we are looking for sponsors for thirty minutes to president's club. So if you know somebody who wants to be a sponsor and you refer us to them and they end up sponsoring the show, we will give you a Starbucks gift card or a corn dog gift card. So where do they sell corn dogs, Armand? I think you can get corn dogs at a hot dog on a stick. Oh, or Walmart? Okay. We need to redo that. Well, everybody, listen to this show. We'll talk to you next time.
