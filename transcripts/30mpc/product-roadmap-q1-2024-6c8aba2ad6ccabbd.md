## Transcript

Maybe it's cold couple time. Welcome to this holiday special road map episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my favorite Kringle, Nick Sigelski. And today, folks, let me tell you, it's cold outside. Nick, why is it cold outside? Well, there's two reasons. One, you left your Grinch outfit on the balcony, and it's freezing up the streets of New York. But it's also cold outside because it is the holiday season, Armand, and I love it. I love it. I love it because today, we get to give you all some insight, some forecasting into what is going to happen with the 30 MPC road map for q one of next year, and boy, do we have some exciting holiday gifts that are waiting to be unwrapped under the tree. Well, let me give you a quick little shake of the gift. So imagine you pick up that box. You give it a good shake. You shake box number one, you hear the paper ruffling around. Inside of box number one, it is a way for you to actually be personally taught by Nick and me. Then you pick up your second box, and you're like, oh, this sounds like a little bit clunkier. It's like a rectangle. Feels like there's some papers in there. You might just have the best sales book you've ever read in your life. Those are your two hints, folks. Let's get on with the road map. But first, there's no way we could move forward without recapping what has happened in the wonderful quarter that was q four twenty twenty three. So if you didn't notice, we've brought on Jen Allen Knuth and Mark Casaglow and some cohosts of thirty MPC, and they are awesome. They are incredible minds in sales. And if you haven't listened to some of the episodes with them, Jen's on with me on the sales podcast, and Mark has been on with Armand on our new sales leadership podcast that we launched last quarter along with our sales leadership tactic tear downs. So we've had a lot of new content come out that if you haven't checked out, I might consider recommending that you listen to it. Correct. But those are the presents of Christmas past, Nick, and now it's about opening up what's under the tree. So we've got a gift, Armand, and I've been shaking it. I've been shaking, shaking, shaking, and I've been shaking it by myself because I haven't seen you recently. You've been locking yourself on the weekends in a coffee shop. And the other day, I was walking down the street, and I saw my friendly neighborhood coffee bean. And I saw you sitting there with your headphones in, a scowl on your face, and you were hunched over a notebook furiously writing. And I went in, and I was like, what's going on, dude? And what did you say? I was journaling after our one on one, and I was writing down all of my angry thoughts on paper so I didn't say them out loud. But then I closed my journal, and I continued to write the book on cold calling. The first ever thirty minutes to presidents club book that we are launching, folks. Very similar to the paradigm behind the boot camp. A lot of people have literally said, I would pay you to chronologically sort all of the transcripts from all of your podcast episodes in order. Or where was the last thing you did on cold calling? Is there any way that I can find all of the tips that you've gotten on the podcast in just order? Most sales books are way too long. There's stuff that doesn't work or it's super outdated advice from printer salesman. Or number three, it's a slew of mindset tips around prospect harder, make more cold calls masquerading as advice. The world does not need more puke, vomit, LinkedIn posts of advice. The world needs more structured advice. So step number one of writing the book is we took the playbooks that Nick and I personally used as practitioners to book one in four cold calls. Step number two, we layered on everything we've learned in 200 episodes in talking to over 200 world class club caliber sellers from companies like Gong, Clari, Outreach, Salesforce, and beyond. And then lastly, number three, we did everything humanly possible to encode the book and the learnings into your brain. That includes, number one, writing down exactly what you need to say on a cold call. Number two, knowing exactly what it should sound like. Literally, the book will be QR code embedded so you can scan certain voiceovers so you can hear exactly how you should sound when you open a cold call. And then lastly, number three, we've written it in fun 30 MPC style where Nick and I actually take turns voicing over and writing sections and throwing the occasional jab over the line. Right. If you want to hear about how Arman was forced to scarf an entire tub of Greek yogurt when he didn't hit his cold call goal, you can read about that. If you wanna hear about my 10 dial low p rule where I'd show up at the office and literally wouldn't let myself go to the bathroom until I picked up the phone and made 10 cold calls, you're gonna get those stories, which I think are pretty fun and funny. Now if you go to the show notes and wanna get the introduction to this book for free, it's gonna be in the show notes, or you can go to 30mpc.combackslashbook. Alright. So the next thing that's coming is if you're not familiar with the thirty MPC club, we are extremely selective about the folks that we let write sections in our newsletter, host 30 webinars, even come on the show. And we have a very tight group of folks that are in the thirty MPC club where we do reoccurring things with. And we've got a new entrant. A new challenger appears, Armand. A new challenger who might just be the best cold caller in the game. This was actually by coincidence that we happen to have two things related to cold calling, and then JC Pollard jumped on, tear down that cold call with you last week, and holy smokes. This was one of the few tactic tear downs where I was literally turning my head and writing notes being like, I haven't heard any of this stuff before. Not only is JC amazing on the phones, JC was historically a multiple number one seller at an outstanding company in Gong. This is like winning the Olympics where you're competing against other world champions for the number one amongst number ones, and JC is an absolute animal when it comes to all things sales. And as part of him joining the club, you can catch him on the first tactic tear down of q one, and you will also catch some exclusive solo playbook episodes by JC throughout q one. So on that note, Nick, why don't you bring us through our q one tactic teardown lineup? So in January, we're going to be doing a steal the cold email campaign that gets 15% plus replies hosted by Jason Bay, JC Pollard, and Tom Alaimo. And then in February, we've got a secrets to smash your competitors even if they have a better product than yours, and that's gonna be with you, Armand, me, and Anthony Anarino. And then in March, we're doing a special collab with women in sales. Watch this to beat any objection in the world with Sarah Brasier, Sam McKenna, and Sarah Plowman. Armand, talk to me about the leadership tactic tear downs. Well, going back to January, folks, we've done two quarters of collabs with hustle fun, and it usually involves founder centric advice. And this time, someone's actually putting me in the hot seat. It's how to sell your first 50 customers when your product barely exists. Yes. Hailey Bryant, an investor at Hustle Fund, is going to be interviewing me and making me whiteboard the exact steps a founder needs to take to build their first cold outbound campaign and sell their first deals. And if that wasn't enough for you, we are rounding it out with a sales leader legend in Sam Jacobs and an exclusive collab with Pavilion where Sam is teaching us how to build a sales team that is not bloated, not having 22% attainment. It's called steal the new model for the anti bloated recession proof sales team. For sales leaders, this is how to hire, how to capacity plan in an economic downturn. And it's me, Mark Casaglow, and Sam Jacobs in a live podcast interview. So, folks, that is the end. And a ho, ho, ho, here's how you can help us out and give us some gifts in return. There are two things you can do. Number one, if you would like to get early access to the 30 MPC book and be on the wait list to get it before it actually drops, go to 30mpc.combackslashbook, and you will actually get a draft copy of the introduction today. And then lastly, if there is anything else that you want to see as part of the content or the product road map or in the book, we are still in the process of building those things, putting the final touches on. Please email product@30mpc.com. I get every single email, and I try to reply to all of them even if I am two to three weeks late. So you know what's in the presents, and Christmas hasn't even come yet. Armond, you gave it away, but, folks, we are so excited to get to work with some of you personally. We're excited for you to get to read about Arman's indigestion after eating a tub of Greek yogurt related to his cold calls. Check all that stuff out. Thanks for listening.

Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer?
