## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my robot cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the one and only, Sonny Round. He is a machine of an SDR leader over at Panopto. And just as importantly, he is an expert and has been experimenting with the thing that everyone has been talking about, which is using chat GPT in sales, and we are going deep on this. So, Nick, why should people listen? One of the really, really frustrating things about my LinkedIn feed is I see all of these influencers who aren't actually, like, selling and using ChatGPT, posting extremely high level advice of here's how to use ChatGPT for sales. Sunny is actually out there, and his team is selling using ChatGPT to do all sorts of things, research, writing messages, refinement. This is an episode if you wanna hear a real sales practitioner from a top tier company and how he is using ChatGPT, you may wish to listen to it. And I promise Arman won't do that robot voice in the rest of the episode. You are incorrect, you stupid human. And by the way, before you listen to the episode, folks, if you like what you heard here, Sonny actually has some of the most common chat GPT prompts and queries that he uses, and he is giving those away to you for free. And you can access those in the show notes because God knows I'm gonna be using them. Let's get on with it. Three, two, one. Take over the world. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Alright, Sonny. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Awesome. Thanks for having me. My top actionable takeaway is to understand your ideal customer profile. I'm sure everyone knows what your ideal customer profile is and why it's important to reach the right prospects. But I really wanna talk about how we can make sure that our ICP is maintaining relevance and staying up to date. So I have a three step process that you can actually use to make sure that your ICP is remaining dynamic with the current market trends. The first step is to go into Salesforce or your CRM and basically create a report of closed won opportunities in the last one year. Make sure you add, as a field in that report, contact title of that opportunity. Export that information. From there, you can take that list of key titles and plug it into chat GPT and essentially prompt it to create you a table that separates out the list by role hierarchy and role type, which will give you, you know, manager, vice president, c level on one side, and then it will give you head of video, head of audio, head of IT, specific role titles, and and specialty types on the other side. The third step to that process is, basically, you're gonna wanna take the information you have and plug it into LinkedIn using a Boolean search, two part search, parentheses. You're gonna use your role, hierarchy, so VP OR, make sure the OR is in capital letters, c e x c e o, etcetera, or manager, end parenthesis, and in capital letters. And then the other side is gonna be video, learning, education, which happens to be the ICP that I sell into right now, Panopto, but your ICP might be very different depending on what, you know, your recent closed won deals are telling you and what ChatGPT is is recommending. You're gonna punch that into the LinkedIn keywords as a boolean and hit go, and that's gonna generate a list of up to date key ICP prospects for you to tap into at the top of your outbound funnel. For those of you who just heard that and said, wow. I wish I could see what that actually looks like. You are in luck because we sat down with Sunny, and we actually documented visually how you can build this list out in chat GPT and LinkedIn using Sunny's brain because mine and Arman certainly couldn't handle it. If you wanna go steal that, there's a link in the show notes. Go grab it. It's free. Okay. What's number two? Awesome. So the second actionable takeaway is to load your top of funnel with the right prospects. You can use the prospects that you're enriching and generating from that that new LinkedIn search that you've just built with your recent ICP. But it's also important to to keep an eye on your your KPIs at the top of your funnel, and making sure that your KPIs align to your goals. So what I mean by that is, you know, we use a a measure, on my team at Panopto called FTV, which is first touch value, and that is a measure of the unique prospects that you're putting into sequence and completing a step one call or step one email for in that given week. So it's important to measure unique prospects being reached because in most worlds, you can only generate a maximum of one meeting with with a single prospect. So if you message someone or call someone 50 times in a week, but it was the same person, it's really not 50 separate touches. But if you measure FTVs, you're actually getting unique separate touches in your funnel. You can reverse out of that to get to your goal. And the simplest way to look at that would just be, you know, if you wanna get 10 meetings in a month and you know that you need to have five replies, so every five replies, you generate a meeting because you're an expert at objection handling from listening to 30 MPC, of course. You know that your your reply to meeting rate is 20%. So if you need to get five meetings, then you need to generate 25 replies. And if your reply rate on your messaging is 10% on your outbound messaging, which is, you know, a low end reply rate of a solid outbound sequence like the Sam Nelson, Agony sequence, what you could do is basically know that you have to reach out to 250 unique people or prospects at the top of your funnel every month to generate the 25 replies that you need to lead to the five meetings that you wanna get every month. So that's how you can kind of reverse engineer out of your funnel to get to your goal with outbound prospecting. Very nice. Round us out. What's number three? The third one is to AB test to optimize all of your processes. AB testing is fundamental to any core growth philosophy or growth tactic, and I think the best outbound salespeople understand that we are, in a way, marketers because when you're doing outbound, you're gonna have to have some volume involved in your game plan, especially if you're doing cold outbound. AB testing is is essentially measuring a change in one process and and measuring its effect on the outcome. So an example would be if you wanted to AB test an individual email messaging. What you would do is, essentially, you could have two separate subject lines. Like, maybe one subject was prospect name dash intro, and the second subject line was prospect name dash company introduction. Where it's a a slight difference in the subject, that would be the variable. The body of the email and the actual message itself, you'd wanna keep exactly the same. And, effectively, after a sample size of 40, you would have an understanding of whether or not the change in the subject was statistically significant to the point that one produced better open rates, better reply rates, better results. And you can do that for as many things as you can think of. Right? Your email signature, remove GIFs, remove links, remove images, test it against another, test the time of day that you're sending emails to prospects. You know, I always like to send emails at 06:03AM or 07:43, you know, PM. Weird times. If you send them at 7AM or 9AM or 09:30, it looks like it's automated. It looks like spam. If you send it at a strange time, it's like, oh, this is a a real person behind this, you know. Sent from an iPhone. I've seen that in so many different, recommendations, including on 30 MPC. I really like to AB test that in in certain templates within our our follow-up cadence messaging. One of the best ones that I've used and continue to use is a moneymaker follow-up. It's a it's a reply to the original email that you've sent, and the reply basically just says, prospect name return any thoughts question mark dash return dash sender name. So prospect name, any thoughts, And it refers to the original email, which you've hopefully put a little bit of customization into, and that's a super, super effective. Like, you know, we see that follow-up poke, which takes no effort and is fully automated, generate, you know, anywhere from five to 10% replies on that single message itself. So that's a really effective one, and and it was only found through hundreds of different variations of AB testing that was found to be the most effective follow-up poke. So AB testing is super important. And the real important thing about AB testing is that you make time to review the results and make the changes accordingly based on the data. Oh, man. Alrighty, Sunny. So we actually haven't had a guest yet. Go really deep on what everyone is talking about in sales right now, which is the use of AI, specifically tools like chat GPT in the world of sales and in the world of prospecting, especially. So I wanna go a little bit deeper with you because you are a highly proficient user of ChatGPT in sales. Before we do that, for everyone in the audience who has not heard of ChatGPT yet or doesn't know how it works or can work for sales, the basic premise is it is an AI enabled chatbot. You can plug different phrases, commands, or queries into it, such as write me an email based on this, or write me an email using these principles, or based on this list of things, help me compose a message like this, and it will spit out some pretty darn good responses. But that is one and only one use case. So, Sunny, in using Chad GPD, in your experience running an SDR team, give us a sense of what are the three, four, or five most common use cases for ChatGPT, specifically in the world of prospecting? One of the most effective things I found that ChatGPT can do is it can induce creativity, and it's super relevant to what we were just talking about in AB testing where we have a ton of different messaging, messaging by vertical, messaging by persona, messaging by use case and product. And what I've been using ChatGPT to do is basically plug in our highest performing template into ChatGPT and just say, hey. Rewrite this message with a focus on brevity, or rewrite this message with a focus on sales creativity, or generate me three subject lines for this email with the focus on open rate. And, amazingly, ChatGPT does a really good job of all of these things. Another use case is you can plug in your prospect's response and say, you know, hey. Generate me a sales focused reply to this response with an emphasis on booking a follow-up meeting. I'm not saying that you should just copy paste verbatim what ChatGPT creates, but it gives you a really good baseline to then start to improve on from there. Especially if you're not sure where to start, ChatGPT can get you going. Another really good use case is doing market research. So, you know, the ICP use case is is a really effective one. But you can also sort of plug in a competitor's web page and say you know, if you go to the competitor's, use cases, say, hey. Based on this web page, create me a list of all of the companies that use this product. I've even used it to plug in our company Panopto against multiple other competitors to say, hey. Compare these three products. Where is Panopto best? And it does a pretty good job of of market research, and competitive analysis. So super effective in in so many different use cases. And I'm still scratching the surface, but I think that being able to induce creativity in your messaging, starting to perform market research, TAM analysis, ICP analysis to to really effectively bring out the best qualities of your product to the right people that you know are gonna buy your product, and, honestly, just testing new things with it every day. So let's start this at the beginning of the prospecting process, and let's go a little bit deeper on the research part of using ChatGPT. And then let's go into the crafting of messaging, which is how most people are using ChatGPT. So, Sunny, I pick up an account. Let's just say that I'm breaking into a solid mid market or enterprise account. What are the parts of the research process that I can take out and streamline using something like ChatGPT that would oftentimes be a repetitive process that I would have to do manually as an SDR or salesperson? So one thing it does really good at is it learns from what you give it. So if you have a, you know, a fortune 500 or a public company, all public companies, they have to file these reports called 10 k's. 10 k's are essentially a huge financial audit, but also an outward facing prospectus for what the company is focused on at the current moment and in the year ahead. And so if you go to sec.gov, that's where all the 10 k's for any public company are hosted. You could also just Google the company name and most recent 10 k. And once you get that 10 k link, copy and paste that into ChatGPT and say, hey, ChatGPT. Based on this 10 k, what is this company's biggest risk that they've highlighted for the year ahead? And then if it gives you a huge response, say, you know, rewrite that with a focus on brevity, and it'll give you, like, a snap of the fingers response that you can then plug into a prospecting email and say, hey. I saw one of your biggest risks for the year ahead, and your 10 k was x. You know, my company solves just that, and I'd love to talk to you about how so that this can be removed from your company's risks and put into your company's strengths. So that's at the company level, which, by the way, brilliant. Are you doing this at the contact level also? Because if I go back to what you talked about in the beginning, right, I'm building this prospect list. Maybe I'm integrating the chat GPT output with what I'm doing in sales and have I've got these companies, and I'm figuring out, okay. At the company level, here's relevant reasons for me to reach out. At the human being level, are you also doing this? And if so, how? As far as, like, researching individual people and prospects, I always advise our team to look at their LinkedIn, review their past experience, review their skills, maybe look at some of the things that they've posted, and be able to to write something to them that that you know is gonna relate. Like, if they have something in their description, like, you know, implement hybrid classroom systems for ten plus years across three different schools and institutions. It's like, you know, reach out with a message. Hey. I see that you're an expert at implementing hybrid learning environments, and I'd love to chat to you about, you know, some of the recent hybrid learning environments that we've been implementing at Panopto. And I think that person to person is always gonna be most effective for that research. But if we take it a step back to, like, the right types of people to reach out to and generating that list of ICP titles, I think Chat Gpk can be really effective for using that information from your Salesforce, from your recent close won to generate title matrixes, which can inform your LinkedIn searches. And then if you look at, like, your replies that you've received from prospects where, you know, so many people get these on the fence replies where it's like, hey. Not the right time, or, hey. I'm not the right person, or, you know, I'm interested, but I actually don't have any ability to make a decision on this and, therefore, wouldn't be the best time or person to talk to. These are, like, what I call on the fence objections, and this is where I think the most effective outbound and and sales reps in general are able to nurture a prospect from that edge of the fence and bring them over onto the side of the fence that is booking a meeting to share value about how your company can help theirs. The way that I've I've used ChatGPT effectively within our team is basically when you get a reply from a prospect and you're just you have writer's block and not sure what to say, put that reply into ChatGPT and just say, based on this reply from a prospect, please generate me a sales focused response with an emphasis on booking a follow-up meeting to share about how we can potentially help them with our product. Plug in your product name. And it'll do a really good job of generating that reply. And if you if you feel like the reply comes in with, you know, four or five paragraphs, it's too long, you don't wanna send all that, you can quickly prompt chat g p t. So focus on brevity or or rewrite summarize what you just said in only two paragraphs. There's a really cool free tool called the Hemingway app. You can even give ChatGPT this website, hemingwayapp.com, and say, using this tool, hemingwayapp.com, rewrite this sales email with the readability at a fifth grade level. Because I think a lot of the data shows that the readability is, most effective at, like, fifth, sixth, and seventh grade levels. And a lot of the times, you know, we're writing sales emails at eleventh or twelfth grade levels. So people, when they get especially outbound cold emails are really gonna be most able to read them in fifteen seconds and digest them when they're focused on brevity and the value and the reason you're reaching out. So sixth, seventh grade level is a really good target for for your responses and your outbound emails. So I wanna just break down a quick premise that you've gone through in both of the examples. So the two examples that Sunny has given us is number one, you can give ChatGPT a form 10 k. And then the other example is you can basically set a standard of rules, at times even based on another tool like Hemingway. So you can say based on these set of rules, write me a better email. Or based on this objection, write me a better email. So if we were to put this into practice at 30 MPC, right, a lot of times we talk about the three or four golden rules of writing an email. For example, it should be three by three. No more than three lines, of text each. No more than three bodies of text when you're writing an email. It should include conversational language like contractions. It shouldn't sound like a robot. It should sound more conversational or casual. Right? Can I feed it four, five, or six golden standard rules for sending a cold email and use that to inform what pops out on the other end? Absolutely. And that's, like, when I found that ChatGPT works best is when you give it rules to operate by. So if you've vetted those six golden rules and then said, based on these rules, rewrite this email, or based on these rules, craft me an email to pitch a cold outbound message based on this company website's product. When you plug in that company website, it'll analyze the website, take the six rules you gave it, and then build that exact sales email. And one of the best features that ChatGPT is if you don't like the first response it gives you, you always have the option to just click regenerate response, and it'll basically change it up. So it'll give you something a little bit different that maybe works a little bit better for what you're prompting. It seems like you're having a back and forth dialogue where I've heard you a couple times say, you'll respond and say, hey. Rewrite with the focus on brevity. Are there other inputs that you're giving it frequently when you're asking it to rewrite or redo your stuff that helps get it a little bit closer to usable for you? Yeah. Definitely. What you could also do is say, rewrite this with a more positive affliction or rewrite this with a less marketing sounding tone and a more personal sounding tone. But if you define the rules as you kinda mentioned earlier, I found it's really effective in in circumstances where you dictate how it should operate. So the more rules, the better. And then kind of prompting it for different things and trying different things where it's like instead of just, you know, rewrite this for brevity, maybe rewrite this with a focus on value for the prospect or rewrite this with less features and more focus on benefits. You know, rewrite this with a stronger call to action. Those are all examples of of things that you can put in to generate new responses from ChatGPT. And then if you have, like, a template for a sequence or a cadence and it kinda has inputs for input your company's value here, input this here, you could even put in, you know, like, the the download of that template that you have, copy paste into ChatGPT, and say rewrite this cadence and messaging using the core benefits of this product and input that website. And, like, it'll be effective at generating a a version for your company specifically, so it could take out the work of really having to do all the thinking and just basically instruct it how to think, and it'll think for you. So just to put this into practice and shamelessly plug, which is a valuable plug, is they could take something like Charlotte Johnson's cold email dripped, which is available on the thirty m b c website and the show notes, or they could take Sam Nelson's a Goji sequence, also available in the show notes. And they could plug in these sequence templates into chat GPT. And they could say, using this sequence template, just make it work for my company. And it should pop something else out somewhat tailored and coherent to your product. Right? Absolutely. Sometimes it takes a couple of different prompting instructions. So maybe you have to put that that cadence that you're plugging in in quotations and then say, you know, use this website to input its key information into the templates of that cadence that are in quotations. So if you explore, you know, a couple of different changes in what you're prompting it, you should absolutely be able to get that result. And while it might not be perfect off the bat, it's a really good v one that saves you a lot of work. Basically, just leaves you to do the finishing touches that us humans are so good at and why we will not be replaced immediately by AI is because we still have that that value to really add the human element at the end. Sunny, I haven't seen Arman smile this much in an interview in a long time, which tells me you've gotten him excited about this. And I think a lot of people listening to this are probably really stoked to go use ChatGPT in their sales process. My guess is you found a couple areas where it's it's like trying to get blood from a stone where, like, it's just not helpful. Are there particular elements that you would say, hey. Based on where ChatGPT is right now, I don't recommend people waste time trying to make it do x. Yeah. So my mind immediately kinda went to, like, how can I automate the entirety of our sales funnel with ChatGPT? And and, like, right now and, again, I'm only using the free version, but right now, it's not super effective at connecting tool sets and building automation. So while you can use it to summarize, to enhance data, to sort through information, to generate new messaging, and generate ideas, It's almost like a creativity engine and a time hacking efficiency engine. But what it isn't is like a complete car. You know what I mean? So it's not gonna be able to take this list of information, generate 100 separate emails for it, ship it into Outreach, and send it into this specific sequence. You can't do that today at the moment. So you can use it for certain parts of your funnel and sales process to kind of turbocharge, optimize, inspire creativity, but you can't have it do your entire funnel for you at the moment. So, Sonny, I wanna talk about not just the prospecting piece, but to wrap everything mid sales cycle. So have you played around with something? For example, at the end of a call, you take a Gong or a a Clari, Wingman, or a Chorus transcription, for example. You take a call recording transcription, and you plug that into ChatGPT, and you ask it to make a recap email off of that. Have you ever tried doing something like that, or is that too much for it? 100%. That's probably the number one use case I've found for ChatGPT is taking complex data and rewriting it in simpler, usable formats. So if you give it a transcript, there is a limit to the amount of characters you can input. I think it's, like, 3,000 or 8,000. You could always do a, you know, if you have a really long conversation or transcript, you might wanna parse it into two separate inputs and say summarize part one, summarize part two. Take those summaries and then say summarize the whole of this. But it is super effective at taking complex data and generating usable information from it. So 100% would be able to do that. You know, I've tested a number of, like, random use cases, like write a cease and desist letter. Not that I'm writing cease and desist letters, but I'm in a a Reddit community called rchatgpt. Highly recommend it. A lot of the use cases posted to that Reddit community are kind of like jokes or absurd things they got chat g p t to do or say, but it gives you a lot of good ideas for for content in everyday life. So, you know, generate a a cease and desist letter. You know, you can have it write a last will and testament. Hopefully, you wouldn't need it anytime soon, but you can have it do that. It's very good with legal jargon. It's very good with medical knowledge. My wife's a nurse. She uses that nurse all the time to understand how medications interact with other medications. ChattGPT passed the medical exam, so it's really good at binary data that's been in textbooks for before 2021. That's definitely just a couple of the scratch the surface use cases there, but it's fun to learn new things about it every day, and it's fun to test new things every day with it for sure. Sunny, sadly, we are running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the final question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it's hurting them more than it helps? Great question. If I had to name one bad habit, it would be there are a lot of salespeople that expect others to do the work for them, and they believe that they aren't capable of doing that work for themselves. So I think it's kind of like, hey. I'm waiting on sales enablement to make me this, or I'm waiting on my boss to give me the okay of a of a target account list or a target prospect list, or I'm waiting on all these things. And and the reality is, like, we're always gonna be waiting on something, but we live in such an amazing age of information empowerment, data accessibility, and ever evolving technology. So don't be afraid to take action. You are highly capable. There is so much information that can help you to do that. For instance, if you don't have the right sales motions, make sure to check out 30 MPC. They have incredible content to build the best sales motions and to make the most of your sales process. If you don't have an idea of how to respond to an email, ask chat gbt to generate you a response focused on, you know, booking a meeting or, you know, generating a follow-up in three months. If you don't agree with your manager or your boss, you know, tell them why, but make sure you have data to support your feelings. It's really hard to argue with data when it supports a hypothesis and presented the right way. So take action. You have the ability. You have the tools. Believe in yourself to use those tools based on some of the things we talked about today to be that change and build your very own sales process. Heck, yeah. If it's to be, it's up to me. Great episode. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Sunny Brown include number one, there were three common use cases for chat g p t in prospecting. The first was fueling it with research like a 10 k to pull out the insights. Number two was writing emails based on that research, and then number three was handling the objections when they came in. Number two, ChatGPT can only pull data up to twenty twenty one, but you can feed it other forms of information like a 10 k or your website or the company, the prospect's website. Number three. From there, you can plug in your website or rules in the chat g p t to write an email based on that information that you've fed it. And then lastly, number four, you don't like that email? That's okay. Tweak it. Ask for an iteration. Ask them to make it shorter or even have it use something like Hemingway to rewrite the email entirely at a fifth grade level. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out? You are a fool if you don't go steal those prompts that Sunny puts together. There's a link in the show notes. Go grab that. We're also gonna link Charlotte Johnson's cold email drip template campaign and the Sam Nelson to go g sequence. So if you wanna steal some of that structure and do some of the connection between structure and chat g b t that Sunny was talking about, go do that. It's free. We want you to help you out book some meetings, and we'll see you at the president's club. And next week.
