## Transcript

So this is my puppy. He's nine months old. His name is Butter. He's a little French bulldog. And if I told you that I hate animals you would probably think that I'm a monster. But last weekend I literally said that to a well meaning salesperson. Don't worry. It was a lie. Let's talk about what happened and what that has to do with objection handling in sales. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. I live in Downtown Pasadena, California, which is a suburb of LA, and there's some awesome coffee shops. And I decided last Saturday afternoon that I was gonna go get a nice latte at Alfred Coffee, and I was gonna get a little bit of work done here. I brought my laptop. I set up. I found a nice sunny patch outside, and it took me, like, five, ten, maybe fifteen minutes to, like, start to get in my groove. I was doing some writing, and fifteen minutes in mid paragraph I get interrupted. Excuse me, sir. And I look up and it's this college looking kid wearing a bright orange ASPCA vest, and he's got a big grin on his face, and he's got a clipboard in his hand, and he goes, Sir, excuse me, but do you happen to love animals? Normally I would say yes. I've donated to animal rescues, and I literally have a a baby French bulldog at home. I love animals. But I was deep in focus mode, and I didn't wanna deal with this guy's sales pitch. And I knew if I said yes, I love animals, he was gonna try to wrangle me into signing some petition or swiping my credit card on the spot. And so I lied to the guy. I looked him dead in the eye and I go, nope. I don't. My objection here had nothing to do with this guy's cause. It had nothing to do with, like, what he was selling. My objection had everything to do with his interruption and that is exactly what most prospects are doing when they give you an objection. They are rejecting the interruption not what you actually sell. And so when you hear, I'm not interested. Call me in six months. Can you send me an email? Look, lady. Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, yo. That's not them rejecting your product. That's not rejecting you. They're rejecting the interruption in the middle of their workday. And the way that most reps respond to those objections, maybe the way that you're responding, it actually makes things worse. And so in this video I am going to show you one, what your prospect is actually thinking when they hit you with those common dismissive objections, two, why most sellers blow it in the first five seconds of how they respond to those objections. And then three, I will give you an approach called the Mr. Miyagi method that I use to turn reactive objections, dismissive objections into real conversation. So let's start by like what's actually going on when you get hit with these objections? We need to get this out of the way first. Cold calling might be part of your job, but for your prospect, it's a really jarring interruption smack in the middle of their workday. They don't know you, you're not on their calendar, and when you hit them with a cold call, their brain is going into overdrive to figure out the fastest excuse that they can give you to get off of this call. And so the first objection that you get on any cold call is usually not a carefully considered no. Instead, it is a knee jerk reaction that is designed to get you away just like mine was to the ASPCA guy at the coffee shop. When you get told I'm not interested, that's the equivalent of them saying I don't like animals. I hate animals even though they actually love them. And so what most reps get wrong in this scenario is when they hear I'm not interested, they panic and they try to overcome that emotion with logic. How can you not be interested? You don't even know what I'm selling yet. Or they decide, oh, I'm gonna pitch harder. Well, we can help you optimize your entire new hire onboarding process to help you save hours a month. Those things might be true. Yes. Logically, of course, they can't not be interested. They don't know what you're selling. And, yes, your product might really be able to help this person. But the problem is when you get hit with those quick dismissive objections, those are emotional reactions, and you cannot fight emotion with logic or pressure. You have to disarm their emotional reaction first and get them to get one foot back in the door so that eventually you can reintroduce logic and get them to agree to a meeting. And that is where the mister Miyagi method comes in. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. And so if you have not seen the movie Karate Kid, there's a mentor to The Karate Kid named mister Miyagi, and mister Miyagi does not block punches head on. Instead, he waxes them off and he redirects their momentum. Wax on. Wax off. And we're actually gonna do the same thing when it comes to these dismissive objections. And so you've got a couple steps here to disarm the emotional I hate animals reaction with objections. So step one of the Miyagi approach is when you get hit with that dismissive objection, you're actually gonna do the opposite of what your gut dismissive objection you're actually going to do the opposite of what your gut wants to do which is fight the objection or overcome the objection. Step one is actually you're going to agree with the objection. So if the prospect goes hey thanks for the call we just don't have any budget but thanks for reaching out. You are not going to try to convince them of how you can help them find budget or how you could make a business case or what your ROI might be. You're actually gonna say, shoot. This one's totally on me. Yeah. It probably doesn't make sense for you to buy something right now. In this scenario, your prospect is expecting you to fight back, but when you agree with their objection, it actually knocks them off balance. You pattern interrupt what every other salesperson is doing by agreeing with them and then you take away all of that sales pressure that they're feeling that's making them give you that fake I hate animals excuse to get off the phone with you. So step two is once you've removed that sales pressure, pattern interrupted, and gotten them from fleeing, you're now going to incentivize them to share more about that objection that they just shared. And so we've disarmed them. We need to get them talking so we can ultimately overcome the no budget objection. So the best incentive that we can give them to share more about no budget is to say, Hey, just so nobody from my team calls you again, just so you don't get any more cold calls, just so I know I shouldn't reach out in the future, just so nobody from my team bugs you in the next couple quarters, just so we don't cold call you again, is it that you're out of budget for this cycle, or is it just a nightmare to get any extra spend approved right now? What I'm trying to do is I'm giving them multiple choice about that budget objection they have so that they share more. And if they want no more cold calls from us, they need to tell us more about their objection. And so depending upon what they tell you, yeah, you're gonna have some jerks that still hang up no matter what. But most people are gonna be like, alright. This person didn't try to immediately hard pitch me. They actually were curious about the reason I said this wasn't a fit. Most folks will give you more about that objection, and eventually we'll we will get enough detail about that objection that we can overcome it and that we can sell a test drive of taking a look at our product, not buying it but taking a look. But the first thing we need to do is get them from fleeing and we need to get them to share more. So let's get into some real examples here. So let's start with the most common objection in the world which is I'm not interested. And you're gonna say Shoot. This one's totally on me. You probably would have reached out to us if you had been interested. Just so nobody from my team calls you again, could you be brutally honest with me? Is it that you've got a solution in place today? You're not thinking about the problem that I shared at all? Or is it you just hate getting cold calls, and it's totally fine if it's that third one. I've given them three options. Now they will tell us more, which gives us a way to have a conversation with them. So let's do another example of, a really common one, which is the prospect saying, hey. Sounds interesting, but call me in six months. So they go, yeah. I'm open to learning more, but right now is crazy dizzy. Why don't you call me in six months? You're gonna go, this one's totally on me. I guess if you were ready now, you you probably would have reached out the other day. Just so I don't sound like a total bozo when I call you back, was there something specific happening in November? Six months from now? Or are you just crazy swamped right now? Let's go to another one. Send me an email. Prospect goes thanks. Send me over an email and yeah I'll take a look. Oh cool. I can absolutely do that. Just so I don't clutter your inbox was there like a specific question you had in mind, or were you more looking for like a general overview of how we help? Now most prospects here are gonna say yeah just send over a general overview. What I'm gonna do here is I'm going to reintroduce my pitch. I'm gonna give them what I call a problem proposition. If you don't know what a problem proposition is, we've got some links in the description of this channel. Go check them out there. I also recommend subscribing to thirty minutes to Presidents Club so you're in the know about some of the terms that we use and ultimately, up level as a seller. But what I'm gonna do in this scenario is I'm gonna hit them with a problem proposition that is relevant to what's in that email. And they say, yeah. Just send over a general overview. I'm gonna say, cool. I'm happy to do that. Just so I make sure this email is relevant, are you like most of the law firm CIOs I've been talking to who have been really frustrated with, like, all of the deductions, rejections, and appeals that they get on the bills they send their insurance carriers, like, right after they win a big case? Because if that's the case, like, I'll make sure to highlight how we help with that. Ideally, if I hit them with a problem here that resonates, a problem they actually have, it gets them to lean in a little bit more, and one of two things are gonna happen. Thing number one is they're like, wait. That's what you're calling about? Yeah. We're dealing with that. Now I'm back in the game. I'm back having a real cold call where I could book a meeting. Or thing number two, which is not the best scenario, but it's actually okay. They're like, yeah. We are dealing with that. And you now have a springing off point, a jumping off point to have a conversation with them where you might not book the meeting today, but you're gonna learn enough about their scenario that you can hit them with a killer email that does eventually turn into a meeting. So let's recap. We talked about why most of these dismissive objections are I hate animals objections. They are not objections to your cause. They're not objections to your product. They are objections to the interruption of your cold call. And so in order to overcome that knee jerk reaction, we need to, one, agree with the objection. This one's totally on me. You probably would have reached out to me if you had been interested. Oh my gosh. This is my bad. I should have assumed things were tight and you wouldn't have any budget. Ah, this is my fault. I'm sorry. I'm calling premature. I should have assumed six months from now would have been a better time. I'm agreeing with the objection, they said. I'm keeping that frame. They're right. I'm not trying to force you to do anything. But then tell me more. The next piece is I need to incentivize them. I need to give them a reason to share more about the objection by saying, hey. Just so nobody from my team calls you in the future, is it a, b, or c? Is it no budget right now, or it's just really hard to get money anytime? Is it you already know what our product does, or you're not thinking about this problem, or you just hate cold calls? I wanna feed them a couple to make it easy for them to pick one and have a conversation about it. So so the next time your prospect tells you, I'm not interested. Call me in six months. Just send me an email. Do not panic. Don't pitch harder. Don't push. Just remember, they're not saying no. They're saying I hate animals and you know what to do from here. So I gave three examples of how you might overcome some of these dismissive objections in this video but we actually put together a list of the 18 most common objections and specific scripts for all of those objections. And if you want it, it's free. There's a link in the description. Go grab it. Learn some of those objection handling responses, and I promise you will have more conversations, book more meetings, and honestly will feel a lot better selling because you're not trying to force someone or push someone who's already got one foot out the door. Thanks for watching and we'll see you on the next video.
