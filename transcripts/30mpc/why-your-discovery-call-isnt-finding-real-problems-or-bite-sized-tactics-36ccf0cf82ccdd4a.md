What would an example of, like, shadow based discovery be or a use of shadowing in a sales cycle be like? There's two, I would say, basic elements or most common elements of the shadowing that you're gonna do. The first is shadowing the painful manual business process that you're likely replacing. That painful manual business process for me, I saw, like, quality assurance tool. So, honestly, that process from start to finish of how they select a case, grade a case, report on it. Basically, there are people who end to end own this process of quality within the organization. I know because I'm well researched on the current state that they're using some combination of Excel, Salesforce, all these different tools. They're swivel sharing. And what I wanna do is see that process so I can essentially drag them through the glass and see where the blood is really being drawn in that process. Shadow process, you're gonna see a bunch of places in that workflow where there's inefficiency. There's gonna be places where your tool differentiates especially that you see within that workflow, and that's really what you wanna drive from that business shadow. Now, how this might manifest itself, for instance, in, like, a discovery conversation. Someone's gonna say, you know, we have this really manual process today. I don't know if it's really possible to replace. We have this really complex reporting. Do you guys think that's something that you can augment or that you can replace? Your instinct might be to say, hey. Like, we are the best at reporting. Like, we will crush that. A better response might be, look. We're pretty confident. Like, those are the kind of problems that we solve for. But before making any promises, we'd like to much better understand that current state of that reporting and that workflow. Can we build a shadow of your current manual reporting process into our evaluation criteria? That way, we are able to speak specifically to that reporting and also tell you what we can't do, and we will be transparent about that. Let's actually walk through a shadowing meeting. How do you actually run that meeting without just, like, sitting over their shoulder and asking them to click on a million different things? If you've prefaced the shadow correctly and you're building champions and driving excitement, they're actually gonna be excited to shadow for you because they had this sense that Max knows how to build a business case. Max is gonna save me from this manual process I'm in. And if I can show him really where this is painful, he's gonna be a great partner on this business case to bring this up. So I think the way that we bring this ethos of shadowing you know, in sales, you always wanna give a reason a why. So as you're going into the shadow process, you're constantly selling, like, oh, the shadow's gonna be great for that because we're gonna be able to articulate how much time this takes you in the current state. I'm gonna take some screenshots, and when we go up to your boss, we're gonna be able to really articulate the painful aspect of x y z thing that we're replacing. So I think for one, like, really, at the end of the day, you are watching them click through their workflow. You're kinda watching the pain of what they do every day. But if you're selling how it aligns to the business case, you're selling how it's derisking implementation, they're really gonna be encouraged to do that, and they're gonna understand where it's going. So I think another big aspect of this, like, champion building is such a massive aspect of the shadowing piece. Because by the time we're going into these shadows, if they're willing to do it, if they're kinda gung ho about it, it means we're forming champions who trust that we're going to solve a problem, and they see this shadow as a means of solving that problem. Leading into it, like, a, you wanna be very clear about what information you wanna extract from that. So, like, hey. You know, Nick, I wanna shatter your QA workflow. What that usually looks like is the selection process, the filtering process, the assignment process, the grading process, then how that filters into reporting, and then how you go from that reporting, and then you go communicate to your executives. So, usually, it's about five to six things that we wanna shadow. Let me know if you have any questions, but guessing that's something that's kinda central to you. So you're really defining what that shadow process looks like. By the time they hop on, they should be very aware about what aspects of the workflow they're shadowing. You should be very innately aware of where your specific differentiators apply to each part of that process. If I'm shadowing this selection process, what are the two to three things that my technology does in that selection process that are really going to differentiate it? And then I'm looking for that and I'm calling it out. Can you show me selection process that are really going to differentiate it? And then I'm looking for that and I'm calling it out. Can you show me that field again? Oh, that field's gonna be really important. If your competitor's not talking about extracting that field, let's make sure to button that away for later and make sure we talk about those really tactical things. Is that you're gonna gain this intimate understanding of what the current state looks like Mhmm. To shadow your competitors a lot. I know what all my competitors look like because I asked to shadow them. And then when someone goes, how do you know that about my competitor? Oh, I shadowed them four times last month and replaced them for three. So this is all coming from a place of deep research that's also a benefit of that shadow process. You know, Max, I wasn't as intentional about you as doing this when I sold ERP software to law firms, but I remember, like, there were a couple times we ended up, I guess, stumbling into doing a shadow, and it totally changed the dynamic of the deal. I remember we had this one law firm. It's a really large law firm in San Francisco. And the managing partner of the firm, he was like, we have a super complex calculation methodology to determine how much we pay the partners of our law firm. And he goes, it literally takes our CFO an entire quarter to do those calculations. One thing that you called out in the way that you were selling the shadow that I think is really important for folks to know, you were like, we're gonna let you know where we can help, but we're also gonna call out, like, where we can't so that we'll let you know where there are gaps in the process. And I think that's really important because a lot of folks, when they're thinking about making a change, are really, really scared of certain places being a step back. And when you use that as a reason to say, hey. We're gonna tell you where we're great and where we actually can't help, It actually reduces a lot of their anxiety. Let's say I'm listening to this, and I'm like, hell, yeah. This is something that I wanna integrate into my sales process. First question for you is, what are some of the other areas where there are opportunities for a shadow? If there isn't a set of manual painful processes or, like, some current state to observe, it means they're probably not trying to solve the problem. So, also, like, something to shadow is a sign that they have tried that that there's intent to solve that problem. And in the intent of how they're trying to solve that is so much data about what they're actually trying to do. So that's one thing is there's gonna be a lot of business workflows. Now underpinning that, there's some set of systems. Like, so many tools today are built on Snowflake or Salesforce. And you might be watching some sort of, like, report. You're watching some Tableau dashboard, but that's, like, sitting on top of Snowflake, and someone owns that Snowflake who is, like, sitting in front of those tables and is, like, screw you, sales guy. I'm not gonna give you the time of day to give you those tables. So you're gonna, like, get the business all fired up. You're gonna do all this business discovery, then you're gonna get to that, you know, VP of data and integrations who owns Snowflake and be, like, oh, all these things you talk about the business, we're not sharing those tables anyway. So, like, it's all a moot point. So as you're talking to the business, is this what you wanna share with them? It's like, look. Share your experience. Kind of a pointed observation, open ended question. A lot of the time, I do all this great business discovery with my business stakeholders, and then we get to the snowflake owner after three months of hard work, and he takes it all over it. What I would like to do is work with you to unlock a shadow with that technical stakeholder so we can actually align on your use case with the person who's gonna be making that integration. So long winded way of saying, you wanna do those business shadows, but then those are gonna unlock the systems underpinning that because there's huge gatekeepers underneath those processes that are going to kill you in the last mile of the deal, and you wanna use these last mile of the deal, and you wanna use these technical shadows to get in front of them. And not just yourself, like, bring the superstars on your team. I'm bringing my CTO, MIT grad, engineer extraordinaire to go nerd out with them. Like, you're not just multi threading with their organization. You're also multi threading with their organization. So when I'm doing that Snowflake shadow technically that I earned through my business stakeholder, I'm gonna say I'm gonna bring my CTO in. Dude's a whiz. He can go toe to toe with you about Snowflake. They're gonna leave that call grudgingly. Like, well, those guys didn't know what they were talking about, and that is kinda compelling that they would pull that that in. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
