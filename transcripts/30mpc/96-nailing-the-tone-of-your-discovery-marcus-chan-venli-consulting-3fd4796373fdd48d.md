## Transcript

Good morning, everybody. And welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my co host, mister Nick Ziegelski. And today, we have mister Marcus Chan for round two, the one and only president founder of Venli Consulting Group. Nick, why should people listen? Sometimes when I am leaving voice mails when I'm making my cold calls, I feel like I'm on the elliptical, and I've set the resistance setting to zero. What I mean by that is I feel like I'm doing all this work, but I'm not really getting anywhere or making any impact at all because nobody calls me back on my voicemails. But Marcus taught me something today that is gonna flip things around and get prospects calling you back. That's all I got, Armand. 321. Call me, baby. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, Marcus. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Awesome, man. Let's dive right into it. So the first one is my 70% voicemail callback framework. Now most people hate to leave a voicemail because the truth is most don't get a response back. And but the truth is with a five to 10% connect rate, that's 95% of people you don't talk to. So if you can get a fraction call you back, you're already the head of the game. So the way you do it that gets you a really high callback rate is very, very simple. So on a cold voicemail early in the sequence, what you wanna do is leverage curiosity and authority to engage a callback. So hear how that sounds. It sounds like this. Hey, Nick. It's Marcus. I'm calling in reference to Lemlist. Please give me a callback at (541) 123-4567. Again, (541) 123-4567. Thank you. Now note there the non sales y tonality and the attitude as that is what makes it work. And when I'm inserting the name of Lemlist there, I'm just inserting, a cost a relevant current customer name of similar size. This will make them curious and create some FOMO when they get this twelve, twelve second voice making them want to call you back, hopefully, as soon as possible. Beautiful. What's number two, Marcus? Cool. So number two is very simple. It's the sliding scale for eliminating objections proactively. Now before presenting price, you want to eliminate all the conscious and up unconscious objections for all buying influences. Any objections you don't handle upfront can potentially surprise you on the back end, which is never a fun thing. So before you share the price, you just wanna assert one really, really simple question, which sounds like this. Pricing aside on a scale of one to ten, one being I hate this never want to see you again and 10 being yes is exactly what I need or what we need. Where do you fall exactly? So at that point they can give you a number. Let's just say they say seven. Then you you ask the next question, which sounds like, well, what's seven mean for you exactly? And then, of course, if necessary, what do you think is potentially holding you back from a nine or 10? Now what happens is this will logically flesh out other objections that can help you redirect your sales process. So then you can actually eliminate all their objections before you actually get to the close. Beautiful. Round us out, Marcus. What's number three? Awesome. So a third one, very simple. It's utilizing damaging admissions to increase trust and certainty with your prospect. Now the truth is, as a salesperson, we're all salespeople here. We love to talk about how awesome our product and solution is. Now as part of your demo or presentation, you want to include a damaging admission to admit any false flaws or issues upfront. So for example, after you've shared some incredible features and benefits with them, you add something like this in. Full transparency, Nick. Our software integrates perfectly with Salesforce. But if you change to a different CRM, our software won't work as smoothly. Alrighty. So let's let's go back to your voice mails and then make our way into discovery. So what you're doing is you're saying, hey. Let's say I'm calling Coca Cola. I might say, like, hey. I'm calling in regards to Pepsi or Doritos even. Right? It might not even be a competitor. And you're saying nothing about what you do, who you are, the company that you're at, all that jazz. What are the kinds of calls back that you get after this? It's awesome. So this is, this is why it's key to do this early on in the sequence. Right? So when they call you back, there's a couple different ways you can go. Either number one, they're confused. They call you up. They're like, hey. So you gave me a call. It's, you know, it's it's Bob over at Pepsi. Like, you know, what's what's going on? And they're actually a little bit confused, which is actually good because that means resistance is down. So now you're able to go into your typical opener, right, which is very, very powerful. Or number two, sometime what you'll see depending on the size of the business, they may think it's a potential opportunity for a partnership or a customer for them, and they're pretty excited. So let's just say, for example, they call you and you're probably busy when they call anyway. You're probably on the phone. You're doing something in your meetings. They might leave a voice mail for you. It's amazing how often when they call you back and they get your voice mail, they'll say, hey, you know, hey, Nick. It's Bob over Pepsi. Like, I'm sorry I missed your call, but, you know, I'm never really in my office. So here's my cell number. Here's my direct line. Or I'm available at this time later to say if you were able to talk. So what happens is they're more open to talk, which is actually just absolutely awesome. And sometimes you might play even a little bit of phone tag, so we kinda go back and forth. And now sudden, even your second voice mail too, but it's like, hey. It's Marcus again. Sorry for the phone tag. Now you have this, like, really odd rapport built with someone you never talked to before. So when you get on there, you have immediate levity to break the ice. And now you can actually have a real conversation about what they're doing and book a deeper discovery from there. That's what happens over time. And then you'll get a small percentage of them where they just they don't call you back. Right? They don't call you back. Right? So then when you call them again a few days later, you leave a very similar voicemail. Now they have two voicemails and they're like, wow. That's strange. If they're they have on their phone, it's transcribed. Like, this is really strange. I wonder what's going on. Am I missing something? Which, again, it caused them to want to respond back to you, which is wildly powerful because an officer when they call you back, they can book that meeting once you talk to them. So, Marcus, let's, let's talk about that first response or that first callback. They call you back, and they're like, hey. You called me about Pepsi. Right? You said go back to your original opener. What does that sound like? Awesome. So I like really simple and direct openers. Right? So let's just say they they call me back, and they say, oh, yeah. It's it's Bob with Pepsi. You called me. I say, oh, awesome. Notice the tone. Oh, oh, it's awesome. Hey, Bob. Thanks so much for calling me. Notice here a couple of things. The tonality shifted. So it's really important to understand that there's a differentiation now that the tonality is completely shifted. Oh, Bob. Thank you so much for calling me. Alright. You know, hey. The reason I actually called is I'm actually with whatever company you're with. Okay? And I'm called in reference to whatever reference you dropped. And the reason I actually called because that because they were actually working with them with whatever solution, whatever offering you have. And I thought, potentially, you might be a really good fit as well for the solution as well. But I know initially called you out of the blue, and you call me out of the blue. But do you have some time to chat about it right now for five or ten minutes? And at that point, they have decision to make. And usually, their resistance is down, so they're like, sure. Or they say, oh, I'm actually kinda busy right now, but, you know, maybe in a couple weeks. Great. At that point, now you can just pull your calendar up and you book them into your calendar. And because, again, the resistance is down, they're still drastically more open to that conversation as long as your tonality is spot on and you're casual with your approach. Well, what you're doing here is really smart because one of the things that we know about selling is sometimes you gotta demonstrate a little bit of social proof. And sometimes when I'm emailing Arman's company, I might mention in that email, hey. We work with these two people who are really similar to you. And that's what your voice mail is doing. You're literally just saying, hey. I'm calling in reference to x, and x is that piece of social proof. And so, like, if, like, again, to Armand, similar example to yours, if I called Visa and I say, hey. I'm calling about American Express. They're they're like, oh, what the heck is this? And what you did is really smart because normally I'm like, they call me back and I've been, oh, yeah. This was a sales call. And then their guard goes up instantly. And instead, what you're doing is you're actually just flipping it. You're saying you're starting with social proof and then going into your value prop or problem prop. Right. As opposed to what most people do, which is they start with their value prop and problem prop, and then they go into the social proof. My question for you is one of the things that we've learned from other guests is it's good to attack multiple channels. Right? Leave a voicemail, send a LinkedIn message, send an email. Are there other associated prospecting activities with this voicemail script that are similar, or is it just the voicemail? So I have found it works most effectively with just voicemail, because this is why it works best early in the sequence. Because say for example, if you if your first first touch point is a call, you leave a voicemail. And then if you go and start, you know, send them messages on, you know, email, LinkedIn, etcetera, over the next several days, Now there's too much familiarity at that point. Now you you really lose the whole reason why it works so well. So that's why I always recommend you start off with calls first. And personally, I prefer the calls first as a touch points, leaving the voice mail because, again, if they if I email them, I can't handle objection I don't hear. On the phone, when I get that up if I get an objection when they call me back, that's great because now I can really feel them out and really position myself for hopefully a meeting with them. If not, set up for future state, you know, future situation where maybe we meet in a couple months or something. But then we have some more familiarity upfront. So that's why typically the deep you are in your sequence is not as effective. So, like, let's say it's, like, three weeks in, you're like, you know, maybe you have a 15 c you know, touch a point sequence. At that point, you do a voice mail at the very end. It may not work as well as you like because they already know you. They're like, okay. This guy's already called. I've already seen his emails. I've seen his messages. He's he's commenting on my LinkedIn. It's just not as effective at that point. So can we roll right into the objection handling side of things where you get that callback and you tell them, yeah. The reason I was calling you is because we're working with Visa, and here's what we did for them. What are some of the common objections that you'll get when they call you back and then you give your pitch that you then handle? And how So, I mean, let's say if it's a big opportunity, a lot of times, like, they they probably have someone in place. Right? Whatever vendor. So it's really usually quite common. So they say, oh, you know what? Sometimes sometimes if you have, like, someone who's kinda sales savvy, they're like, dang. That was good. Okay. You got me to call you back. They kinda laugh a little bit. Like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, but I'm I'm, you know, you're you're funny, Marcus, but, you know, we're we're we're actually totally good, man. We already have this vendor. We've used them for a number of years. I say, cool. That's fantastic. That makes a lot of sense because you are Visa. You are Pepsi. You are whomever. So if you don't mind me asking, who are you guys currently using? That's it. So I've got I opened up a little bit of the conversation. Oh, you've been using company x for whatever I'm selling. Oh, that's great. I've heard amazing things about them. I'm nothing but good way to say about them. And then depending on the angle I wanna go, it might be like, hey. So we actually have a few different solutions that can really complement really nicely if you're open to learning a little bit more. So, again, I know this is a little bit out of the blue again. So do you wanna keep this conversation going right now, or we can set up a deeper conversation, like, fifteen, twenty minutes, say, next week at Monday at 1PM? So, again, I'm just addressing it. I'm not making it a big deal. Again, we're just having a conversation about it. Now works really well, especially if they feel like they've been very loyal to their vendor for a very long time. Marcus, can you talk a little bit about the intentionality around tone on the cold calls? Like, a lot of times you're just like, oh, yeah. Of course. Like, I know those guys. Or when you get a callback, you're like, oh, hey. Awesome. It's good to hear from you again. Like, what are some of the deadly sins that you hear folks do around tone, and how how can we do it a little bit better on the phones? Such a good question. So I think one of the things, especially, if you are like a BDR or STR, is your tonality does not align to the level of status of the person you're calling. So when you call someone who is a c suite, a high level, you know, high level decision maker, and you sound like this is the first time you made a cold call, they're not gonna wanna talk to you. Like, that's one it's such a simple little thing where that's where the words you say really don't matter as much as how you actually say it. So if you notice you even with, we're not what in this these role plays we're doing, it's coming up. Okay. I know this person. I'm of equal status, and I'm very comfortable. It's as if I've done it thousands of times. Now personally, I have, but, you know, even if you are relatively new, it's making sure that even when you practice it, when your tonality comes through, it sounds like you've done a thousand times. And then when you get the objections, which is gonna happen regardless, do you sound like it's the first time you ever heard it? It's like, oh, oh, okay. That that makes sense that you have a vendor. Yeah. For sure. Versus yeah. Makes sense. Of course, you have a vendor. Like, you are Visa. Of course, you have a vendor in place. You're not a start up. You've been around for literally decades. So understand the tonality piece of having that conviction and confidence. And whatever they throw at you, it really needs to sound like you've heard it thousands of times, and it's not a big deal. If it sounds like a big deal, they feel like you have no experience and that you're not actually gonna be relevant in helping them out in solving whatever issue you claim you could solve for them. So, Marcus, you you talked about role plays, and one of the things we've story told about in the past is I would walk around the streets of San Francisco, and I would just imagine someone with my headsets on, not talking to anyone. I would imagine someone said, I'm not interested. And I would practice the laugh. I would practice being like, that's all I I guess you woulda cold called me if you were interested. And I would practice these things a million times so that when it came to me on a cold call, I was ready for it, and I had heard it a million times from myself. Now I looked a little bit weird, but maybe you have some other ways where you might not look as weird. But what are other ways that I can go about practicing that confidence, and getting better and get getting more reps in on the phone before I actually get into live action? Yeah. Great question. So repetition is a father of mastery. I mean, that's just what happens. I thought I love you sharing that specifically about you walking to San Francisco, like, back when I was a field rep, I'll do the same thing in my car, driving my forty minute commute. I was role playing out loud, like, the worst prospects. Like, I'm like, I imagine they're cursing me out and I'm still like, oh my god. I've done a million times. Like, and I keep going. You know, for those who are you're probably working at home right now, it's actually building in time with the repetition. So no different than, you know, sports than anything else. The top athletes aren't the ones who'd only, like, really catch the ball on the field. They are off the field in the gym. They're practicing nonstop to really make sure when that ball is thrown to them, when that person answers a phone, they're ready to go. So it's taking the time to build it in even if it's if it's five minutes a day, it's even it's it's it's not it's still better than not doing it. But on top of that, what I really recommend is you need to put yourself into state. Right? So even you recording on your phone with a voice memo, you going through and imagining multiple objections, role playing the worst scenario, and record it. And then listen back to yourself over and over and over so you feel really good, and you build your own internal confidence. Because as we all know, sales is a confidence game. It's a bank account. We had the deposit or we do withdrawals. Any knee constant with deposits into that confidence bank to feel really good. One of the easiest ways to control that is simply making sure you do the repetitions. And the thing is most sales managers aren't gonna make you do it, so you have to hold yourself accountable to it because ultimately, that's what's gonna make you good. When you take ownership in the game, that's how you actually really improve, and you actually build confidence in your scripting, in what you say, in every single thing. So for example, you've learned some scripting so far on this podcast. Those are listening. It's not cool. That sounds good. I'm a try out my my first cold call. It's I'm a write this down, and now I'm gonna go and practice it 15 times, and now I'm gonna go do it. And then when you sound really good in your commissions there, that's how you get calls back. That's how you when you start doing, you'll probably get maybe 10% callback, then 20%, then 30%. And the more you do it, the easier it gets, and it flows without you thinking. The other thing to note is find somebody and explain how your solution actually works to them. I will never forget my first ever sales job. I was sitting in the hot tub with my girlfriend, and she was like, so what do you guys actually do? And I explained it to her, and, like, midway through my face started getting really red. So I was like, it was not how I actually communicate. And she looked at me, and she was like, what are you talking about? And so, like, you've gotta explain stuff the way that you would to a friend. And speaking of how we would explain stuff as we would to a friend, let's talk about we've overcome the objection. Somebody called us back, and we've shown up on the discovery call. There's an opportunity in the discovery call sometimes to explain our stuff. So you boot up the Zoom. Arman joins. He's only three minutes late. He's your customer. You're there with your smiling face, Marcus. How do you start that call? Sure. So I think the the rookie mistake is you should talk about the weather. Okay? Or you start, like, you know, go into some long spiel. You try to go into, like, immediate upfront agreement or something like that. Like, not to say those things can't work. I'm just saying it's people are people are tired of that. Right? And people wanna know they're talking to a real human being. Right? So, you know, Arman shows up late. It it is it is what it is. Right? So I I like to just start off, like, my camera's on. Right? And sometimes they have the they don't have the camera on or off. You don't really know. Maybe they do. They don't. I don't really care, but I'll have mine on, and I'll I'll pop on. But, you know, hey, Omar. What's going on, man? I wanna make sure my camera's on so you know I'm a a real dude in Oregon, not some rando in a cave somewhere. Break that. Pause. Let them kinda kinda like, cool. Alright. Cool. So Amelia's showing I'm of equal status appear that you they can know, like, and trust me. We're like we're just like, we should be able to have a great conversation. And then before I dive in and stuff, I'm like, hey. So, you know, day go day go good so far. That's it. Real simple. I don't wanna spend fifteen minutes talking about, like, a bunch of, like, you know, baloney because I need to make sure, like, I have his attention right now. I finally got the meeting. What are we gonna talk about next? So they they say, oh, oh, yes. What going good? I say, cool. I act at that point, I'd actually insert a little personal thing in there just to humanize the situation. Right? So that might sound something like, oh, great. Cool. I just I just got done picking up my kid from school. Yeah. Awesome. So I'm excited to chat with you. Some man's a little bit it's a little bit personal message. Again, humanizes the situation. Right? Well, I forgot to mention as well. The backdrop to videos is is key too because if you're on Zoom, what they see around you may cause them to trigger certain things as well. They it can either add trust or remove trust. So again, from there, they might be like yours yours is okay, Nick. I'm just saying. But in general, then they see it. They're like, oh, cool. Like, you got this cool green light, kinda like 30 MPC. Alright. That's a nice that's a nice flow right there. Alright? If you're watching the video. So they say, oh, cool. Whatever. You you you you talk for a second and say, cool. Awesome. So I say, obviously, hey. Listen. Obviously, you know, you're very busy. Let's, let's just let's just dive right in. Is that cool? Awesome. Cool. And then I'll just do, like, a little bit of a recap based on what we're discussing. Hey. So, you know, when we when we just when we chatted a couple days ago, when I when I called you how the blue, you know, what I mentioned was I'm I'm actually already working with Pepsi, helping them with whatever solution and achieving desired objectives. So my goal today is just to do a little bit of deep dive into your situation. And then from there, we can kind of plan next steps to see what makes the most sense to potentially work together. Is that cool? Awesome. Great. Face it. Very casual, very simple. Not a big deal. Right? I find that oftentimes we get so caught up in the tactics, but what people don't realize is, Marcus, you and I get onto a Zoom, and in thirty seconds, I'm gonna put you somewhere on the ladder in terms of where I see you presenting yourself. And a lot of folks, they come on board, and they're either super awkwardly or nervously trying to build rapport, or they come in overstructured overstructured with the upfront contract, what have you. And what I find is that the the sooner you can figure out, like, what you actually wanna say and just be comfortable saying what's actually on your mind in front of an executive, the sooner they start to respect that level of genuity for you. But way too many folks, you can tell they've read too many sales books, and they overmanufacture the beginning of the call. Instead of being comfortable calling out an executive every once in a while. Mhmm. And that's how they rub elbows with each other and it's a good level there. That's how you get that level of respect. 100%. I mean, you know, they they have to, again, they have to feel like you're least someone of value. They want they're there's they're sizing you up once you get on the call. They're like, is this worth my time? And if they don't think it's worth the time, they'll be like, well, anyways, Marcos, we're good. We gotta we gotta we gotta wrap this baby up. I I gotta go. It'd be it's been two minutes. Like, I'm sorry. I must have double booked. So you you don't want you need to establish those as fast as possible because let's just say, for example, it's a big company like, say, it's Pepsi or Cocoa you're calling into. You know, if you're calling, like, the executive vice president, they may not be the person that drives the whole deal, but but you need an executive sponsorship to move the rest of the deal forward. So and they're not gonna pass you to the all their their team their whole team if they do not trust you. They'll cut you off, and you're and you're stuck in water. You're dead in the water. So, Marcus, we've talked about the tone and the way that you present yourself. But if I'm in the room with a c suite and I'm asking discovery questions, what are above the line topics or above the line questions that I can be asking instead of getting caught in the weeds? Sure. For sure. Yeah. So, typically, once when you're when you're talking to the C suite at that high level of big big organization, most of the time, they they don't they may not even know what what software they're using. They may not know the ins and outs. They don't how how many users. They don't know the specifications that you may need to know. All they really care about is like, hey. How will you help them drive the overall objectives? Okay. Now so for example, you know, if you wanna be very simple direct, you can just literally go out and just just you start with their overall initiatives. Hey. So you you stop with them. You want to establish you you've done your homework and your research in advance very quickly with them. So that might be as simple as, hey. So, you know, take a look at your guys' you know, most recent earnings transcript from 2021 and also the call transcript by those. You guys said the three big priorities for this upcoming fiscal year is going to be major growth initiatives, and you're gonna do that by doing x. And number two, it's gonna be also improving safety as a company culture because you had x number of incidents that really impacted your overall turnover as a company. Whatever. I'm making something up. So for you, did I am I correct and just make sure I read that properly? Yes. You are. Cool. Can you tell me a little more about specifically why you chose the specific objectives? So now we're starting to go into overall key objective. And some people, like, if you're a rookie salesperson, you're thinking, well, that's not gonna help me sell my software. Actually, it does. Because ultimately, whenever you're selling whatever product or solution, it's gonna help them to use certain motives, and that's an ultimate drive to core objectives that the executive wants. So we can tie it all together by uncover what what they want the highest level helps drive down everything else. So you start off to understand their core objectives and then go a little bit deeper. And then from there, you'll start seeing that they realize that you actually know what you're talking about. And that's wildly powerful again because now you can utilize that because whatever key issues they have will trickle down to their teams and everything is aligned together so you actually can move the deal forward. Otherwise, your solution becomes a nice to have and not a must have. I wanna point out a piece of distinction in what you were doing there. What you did not do was show up to that meeting and say, tell me about your priorities or what's important to you and your business this year. Instead, what you did is you said, here is what I found doing my research. Is that right? And news flash, you won't always be right. You might have found, like, an outdated article or that person's specific team doesn't touch those things. But by very virtue of you having done some research and said, here's what I found when I was doing research, you've earned credit in the other person's book. You are always better off saying, here's what I found, here's my hunch, here's my thesis, than saying, I don't know, you tell me. Are there other questions that you're gonna ask? So now you get into a conversation. Right? And they're talking about the growth initiatives and the different lines of business they're trying to grow. Like, are there other questions or question techniques that you'll use to try to further that discovery call closer to you ultimately winning their business? So I think what's important to understand that you probably want to have some key simple go to frameworks, especially if you're kinda new to even just kinda discovery that you can kinda pull out and utilize for majority situations if you get stuck. Because what you don't want to happen is you you don't want to just get that low and you're like, let me just start pitching this pitching this this this exec now on my solution. Let me start trying to do a mini demo. Let me pull a slide deck out. Don't do any of those things. So the truth is is that when you look at discovery, I picture it's just like an onion. And you ask first couple layer of question, you peel first couple layers, but you wanna keep diving deep as possible. And for sure, you can use, like, you know, how, what, and why questions. But sometimes even in the moment, it's not as appropriate as it make as much sense. So a couple really simple go to easy phrase you can literally use right now. Whatever they say, you can just say, great. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? And just stop talking and just wait. Let the silence fill the call so they can tell you more. Another really simple one is, can you elaborate a little bit more about that? Again, you can use this for, like, a majority of situations now because those are really simple easy ones, you know, because obviously you can go into the how and the what, but you incorporate these couples. Those those wanna tell me a little bit more. Can you elaborate about that? Now you can they're gonna start diving deep into the root of the onion, and that's actually where the magic usually lies or what they truly desire. And if you can start diving some of the psychographics and some of their decisions, it's amazing how much faster you can move a deal forward. So what I mean by specifically, just give you example so you it actually makes sense for such as theory. When you when you start diving to maybe the core objective, like the initials I mentioned earlier, let's just say it is growth we had mentioned. Okay? And we start diving into really why it's important because it seems obvious. They start diving deeply how it actually impacts that specific exec. And they say stuff like, well, the truth is is because now they trust you as a peer. The truth is is, this is my first time as a CEO. I've been CFO. I've been CTO. I've never been a CEO before of a company. I really wanna get recognized in the Wall Street Journal this coming year. So now you suddenly realize this from a psychographic perspective. You are digging into that or status level. And when you can tap that deeply, trust and respect you as may not be on the first call always, but sometimes a little bit little bit later on. Now you can leverage that to actually move the deal forward. And that's really when you become powerful discovery because, again, deals are made and broken within discovery. Well, Marcus, a lot of people are afraid to ask why questions because they think they're very antagonistic. Why'd you do that? Why are you doing this? What have you. But you're essentially asking a why question or a TED question, a layering question. And people hear, oh, yeah. Let's let's say I ask them about their compensation priorities because Pave is a compensation company. Someone might say, hey. I you know, I I'm really focused on making sure employees understand their total compensation. And people will take that at face value. But if you ask why and say, like, most people don't wake up and think my employees don't understand their total compensation. Why is that the priority you picked? You'll almost always get a story as to this employee left the company, or I've had 10 people leave, or I had these many people complain, what have you, and that's how it ended up on my priority list. Never take it at face value. Always try to get to the root cause of why that is the face value priority in the first place. Absolutely. The the root the root cause drives everything else. And sometimes when they may not know it off the top of their head, but only when you ask questions like a why question. Then obviously, you're right. If you do if you don't do it properly, it comes off as you're you're just coming at them hard and antagonistic. But if you read them and if he says if you get a little defensive, then you can insert other trust based language that says, well, you know, Armand, if you don't mind me asking. And you notice here, my tone is softened. I'm lowering my voice a little bit. I'm adding some pauses in here. I'm saying, well, if you don't mind me asking, how come this is such a big priority for you? Then from there, you'll be like, oh, wow. Here's why. So that's why it's it's important to understand is the what what you say is important, but how you say it again, back to tonality can really help you get the truth. Because ultimately, as a salesperson, all you want is the truth. When you have the truth and you have clarity, this helps you know, number one, is this worth my time? Can I truly help them? If I can, great. How can I help them? Marcus, we have talked about a lot of wonderful things that salespeople should be doing, but I wanna flip that on its head and ask you the inverse. So the final question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that they need to break because it's hurting them more than it helps? Sure. Well, I'll say the simple one is they live day by day. And what I mean by that is they're not taking the time to proper prepare and look ahead in advance, what their whole week should look like, what their whole month, what their whole quarter should look like. So give you a really specific example. Let's just say, for example, you're thinking, hey. For my quota for the quarter, I need to sell let's call it, a quarter million dollars. And then they put in their funnel, in their pipeline, like, oh, I feel pretty good about 300,000 in pipeline. I'm feeling pretty good. You are still living day to day at that point because the truth is is you you very rarely will close 100% of your funnel. That's just I I've never done that. Maybe you've done if you're lucky, maybe probably better than me if that's the case, but I've never done it personally. So when you are looking ahead and you're really thinking about how to not live day they live actually in the future. You're looking at your pipeline now. So say, for example, you wanna close $300,000. You know you have a 25% close ratio. Well, now you could take that pipeline multiplied by four. I now need a $1,200,000 in pipelines active to close at least $300,000. So when you start thinking this way, this now cause you change behaviors and habits to not live day to day. But now how can I structure my my days, my weeks, my months to ensure I'm gonna not just hit my number, but far exceed it? And with a little bit of luck, of course, from the sales gods, if you will, I'll do way beyond it as a result. Beautiful. Marcus, anything you wanna promote before we jump off here? Cool, man.

I got free trades inside there to help you earn additional $50,100 k more in commissions and bonuses. Beautiful. Marcus, thank you so much for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Marcus Chan include, number one, replay or role play the worst case scenario over and over and over and over again so you are never surprised when you get a tough objection on a cold call. Number two, early in the sequence, use the 70% callback voice mail, which includes you just referencing that you work with a similar company or you're calling in regards to a similar company, and that's it. Don't tell them what you do, where you are. Give them your phone number. Get off. Number three, when you jump onto that discovery call, keep it cool. Don't overstructure because you will give away your junior stature relative to an executive. And lastly, number four, don't be afraid to ask root cause questions or tell me more or why questions to understand the intent behind the priorities. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? If you have a friend, send this show to a friend. Some of you might not have any friends, and it's just you, me, and Armand, and that's okay. You don't have to share it with anybody. We'll give you a pass this week. But if a friend of yours exists in this reality, consider sharing the show with them. Thanks for listening.
