## Transcript

The purpose of a product tour is almost the same elevator pitch that you would give in slides. Don't use slides, instead just show them, which means this is still something you can do within one minute, and it's still the purpose is to kick off your discovery. Giving them a glimpse of the different capabilities of it, which often I found, one, allows you to start asking discovery questions sooner than you would. Two, you can start to see the kind of prospects, reactions, and feedback, and you can start to see what's peeking their curiosity and what's not. And that just allows you to actually start asking questions right there. Number one, show, don't tell. Use a product tour in your first call, which is different than a product demo to give a glimpse of the solution rather than just using slides. Show your prospect versus just telling them allows you to way more quickly allow them to start asking questions to do discovery, potentially identify additional use cases and stakeholders. And in this, it's not a demo. You are talking about the solution. You're not diving into features, but rather you're telling a story with the product and using it to highlight the product's capabilities and use cases. For example, back when I was at Census, it is a tool that sends data from your data warehouse, where it lives into your your end tools, Salesforce, marketing tools, your customer success tools. In a product tour, for example, on the first first slide at the beginning, I may show the homepage which shows all of my list of integrations saying, hey. My customer attributes are pulled from my data warehouse, sent into Salesforce's custom object for our CSMs to use. Someone can understand what this end state looks like. And using that, I'm gonna tell a story. I can tell the story around how Sensus is going to allow you to retrieve that customer data that usually since locked into a data warehouse and actually get it into the hands of your teams who need it every single day. And the way I'm gonna do this is by first very simply hooking up to my where the data, connection where the data lives. It could be my data warehouses. It could be other databases, anywhere your engineering teams are holding this data. Next, I'm gonna show how easy it is to set this up. Typically, the alternative is actually to write custom code. We all know that takes a very long time. Often, that means Python scripts wrapped in duct tape. Here, I'm gonna show you literally a flip of a switch, and it is up and running. And finally, I can show you how easy it is to see it in your integrations. And there, I'm gonna pause and start to do discovery, ask what piqued their curiosity. If I notice someone's eyes kinda flicker at a certain part, I'm gonna pause and ask that person what's going on, and that's gonna open the door of I have now given them a glimpse of the solution. Let's now talk about it, and I'm gonna start doing much deeper discovery and get to probably what would have taken me to the end of call two, hopefully, by part way through call one. Why use demoing in the first call? That doesn't sound right. Yeah. I'm gonna say don't demo. Do a product tour. The two things are different. Demo, I agree. You cannot demo a product until you have done full discovery. You truly need a tailored demo. I am a 100% in that boat. A product tour does something else. We know that, buyers are itching to see the product, and we know typically we need to do discovery to be able to unlock that. What often happens, especially in a high velocity sale when someone knows they're trying to move fast, is they're like, I just wanna see the product. And it's from a selling side. We're just saying, no. No. No. Please answer these questions, and it just it starts to deal off on the wrong foot. And so the purpose of a product tour is almost the same elevator pitch that you would give in slides. Don't use slides. Almost don't yeah. Don't use slides. Instead, just show them. Have a staged demo environment where you can really curate this story that showcases the capabilities of your solution and use that almost to give your elevator pitch, which means this is still something you can do within one minute. And it's still the purpose is to kick off your discovery to unlock a true product demo. But what it allows you to do is, one, as soon as you show your screen, often buyers get surprised, pleasantly surprised. They're like, oh, I can see the product so fast. You're giving them a glimpse of the different capabilities of it, which often I found. One, allows you to start asking discovery questions sooner than you would. Two, you can start to see the kind of prospects, reactions and feedback, and you can start to see what's picking your curiosity and what's not. And that just allows you to actually start asking questions right there. And I've also noticed it's a great and easy way to start bringing up additional use cases, and a great way to identify additional stakeholders much faster. So if I'm talking to sales and I'm telling them, hey. I can get your sales data into from a data warehouse into your Salesforce instance, and I Marketo is also on the screen. I can also bring up we also have marketing instances or integrations like Marketo. Is there anyone on the marketing side that may be interested? Often sometimes, like, oh, actually, we should maybe go talk to Susie on the demand gen side, and that's a great person. And then for the second call, we're gonna do a fully built out demo. Now have an additional stakeholder and potential champion to bring in. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
