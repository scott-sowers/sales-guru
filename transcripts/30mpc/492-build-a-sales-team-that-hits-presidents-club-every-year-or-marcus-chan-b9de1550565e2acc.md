## Transcript

As a sales leader, you think yourself, okay, this is one of the highest leverage thing I can do, which is make my team better. That means then you need to go through and find stuff to show them and teach them. That means you're listening to podcasts like thirty minutes of private club. You're pulling one tactic out, and you're gonna practice yourself to get really good with it. In reality, this is this is what separates the elite from the average. The average leaders will say, sounds like too much work. Well, you're right. It is a lot of work. But you know what's even harder? When you miss your number and you go get a new job. That's even harder. But when you're actually really good at your job, you have longevity in your career, it's amazing how much wealth you can build because of it. What's gonna be harder? Doing this or, like, getting a different job because your team's not performing? Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Frogg, and I'm here with my host, Marc Cosclo. And today, you might have heard him on the sales show before. He's one of our best guests of all time. His name is Marcus Chan. He hit Presidents Club nine out of ten years running sales organizations from three to a 110 reps. At one point, he was delivering over a 190,000,000 a year in new business, and this is the first episode I have ever heard Mark say, I don't have any questions because your takeaways were so good. So, Mark, why should people listen? That is so true. This guy, like, usually, when we listen to the take ways and do the prep stuff, I have like a list of questions. I didn't have any questions because I understood everything. And that's why you should listen. This guy talks like he has thought about this stuff and explained it a million times, and he's boiled it down to, like, three simple things. Two simple things. Do this, this, and this. And I think that this is probably one or more tactical episodes, and we know for being tactical. Yeah. It's a good one, folks. So if you wanna level up your team, keep tuning in in a three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, Marcus. Welcome back to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. Cool. Number one, create a personal success blueprint for each new hire. So this is a tool I use to take turnover from over 50% down to sub 20% in the first year that already over 100 plus reps will pick up every single year. So it's really quite simple. So for every new hire or new employees, just sit them down and you you can use a Google Sheet and you fill a personal success blueprint Like, there's at least five categories. So, you know, number one is gonna be the personal, personal goals and income goals. Two is what drives them personal, so their why. Three is how best they like to be led. Four is how they like to receive feedback and to perceive strengths and weaknesses. And you use this form as a guide to conversation about their future, and they list out, like, two to three action items that really help develop them. So for instance, let's just say if they say, you know, hey, Mark. I wanna get promoted eventually. So So you said a really clear action about helping build a really core skill for the future. So that could be something like set up time with the general manager to walk through the p and l and how all departments connect together, put together a presentation to teach the team. So something like that so they can walk and do it literally right after the meeting together. Boom. What's number two? Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Create the road to Penn's Club routine. So the reality is is most reps have zero idea what a good day or a good week even looks like. That's actually realistic. So build a really simple visual tool inside the Google Sheets that breaks down what we call the road to Presidents' Club. So this this shows you a little bit hour by hour exactly what a Presidents' Club AE routine looks like from when they start work. So it breaks on visceral detail. Let's say, for example, if they wake up at 8AM to 5PM, what do they do? That could be exact phone prospecting times, all of their internal meetings, that's sales meetings, one on ones, team trains, etcetera. How many sales spots available for discoveries, demos, etcetera? So instead of expectation, how many of those are, the prep time, or whatever it's gonna be. So it should be so clear. They follow it verbatim. It'll be hard not to be successful. So for instance here, you can have all your internal needs inside there. Let's just say, for example, you want your team to prospect more. So one of those blocks could be from eight to 10AM, Monday through Friday is a prospecting block every single day. So, ultimately, once you have this completely filled out, this becomes the benchmark for training and the minimum expectation. So if performance wanes, it's really easy to compare to what a perfect week is and to recalibrate if you need to. Alright. Bring it home. What's number three? Number three. I call it the three three three coaching system. So that's three meetings, three strengths, and three focuses. So by the twenty fifth of each month, send out a calendar invoice for two different half days together with each AE on your team. And you set the clear expectation. They are set up three meetings that are a mix of new discovery calls, demos, exec readouts, etcetera, depending whichever role that they're selling for. Now the AEs are also to send calendar invites to any prep materials in advance as well. Now on those half days, you wanna meet fifteen to thirty minutes in advance a day to game plan, you know, for, you know, for a little bit. And then at the end of the half day, a thirty minute box to actually debrief with them together as well. So then you use this opportunity to observe, help, and show your AE how to be successful on the calls regardless of the development level. So even they're brand new, if they're struggling, if they're crushing it, you're dealing with every single AE on your team. And then at the end of each half day, you review the day together with them, and you identify three things they excelled in. And then you just pick only three things to focus on that'll make the greatest impact. So don't give them 100 things. The three things, they'll give them the greatest impact across their whole sales process. And you make sure whatever you pick, you are crystal clear on the what, the how, and the why. So literally, they can walk away, implement literally immediately. If you do this consistently, you'll see your teams, like, skills results improve over time while you build massive trust with them as beyond just, you know, checking the box. Wanna go back to this personal success blueprint, Marcus. I've seen a lot of people work with their teams on a Google document that try to get out, like, what is this rep's motivation? How do I support them? And then literally 15 after they finish the doc, it's never referred to, looked at or mentioned again. Right? How are you getting this built into the DNA of your team so that it becomes like something that's useful and not a one off exercise? You're absolutely right, Mark. Most time people treat us like a flavor of the week or a one time event. You want to be part of their journey. So there's a couple of things I would highly recommend. So I think number one, when you actually walk through the personal success blueprint, that should be the only objective of the meeting. So literally, like, this is the meeting. We're only doing this single thing. So you are creating significance around that. Then number two, let them know in six months, we're gonna discuss this again. Now if you're managing your calendar tightly, I will literally at that time, just like you're booking a prospect or the dentist, open your calendar up. You book that meeting six months from now. You put it into your calendar so it's set on your calendar on there. Even if you need to adjust a little bit, let's get a little closer. At least it's on the calendar and they see it, they accept it, and they realize, woah. This leader takes it very, very seriously. Now if you don't wanna put it in your calendar, this is what I did personally because my calendar got crazy all the time. You know, I actually just had a tickler for in my invite that I just created, say, hey. Set up, you know, you know, set up development conversation with x. So that way I like I see it like, oh, it's time to do it. And that way when it pops up, you just you book that new time with them. And what's actually really amazing is when you do it the second time with them, they're blown away, Mark, because they're like, okay. I thought this was like you just kinda checking the box. You actually sat down with me initially. No no one's ever done that. And now you actually fall back up, and actually you're actually holding me accountable to these action items. And they realize now you actually truly care. And it's amazing because at this point, let's say they're brand new. You've now had six months of developing trust and relationship with them, rapport. So as long as you're consistent, they really see that you truly want them to win. So this is actually how you get them to perform and reduce turnover while also deploying discretionary effort at a whole new level. I guess what I would be nervous about is doing this and set an expectation. And then my managers are now like not doing it because it's like not in their face every day. I'm not going to bring this up before every one on one and be like, Oh, let me remember how Marcus wants me to give feedback. So how do you get, like, into the manager so that it's useful? Yeah. Great question. So I think the the first piece is if you're overseeing managers, you do the same thing with your managers. So the greatest leaders lead not by just what they tell their people do. They actually do it with their leaders. So I'll give you a really simple example. So, you know, I went from, you know, managing I was a sales manager running a a routine with six to 20 reps. Okay? Overnight, I got promoted, and suddenly I ran an 84 five 85 person org with eight different sales managers at the time. Right? One of my first things I did with each of them is with literally the exact same each leader. And they're shocked because they're like, no one's ever done this before. Right? And then I actually then did with each of their reps. So I actually showed them what good looks like. Each of the reps do I sat on each of the reps. They saw me run through their rep their team of eight to 12 reps individually with them. So the first year, while I was helping them develop this rhythm, they saw me do that. And six months later, when I was back in town again, I did the same thing with the reps again, and I did the same thing with them as well. So they start to see that I was leading through my actions of what I expected. So that's that's a key. If you want to change behaviors, performance, it's not you can't be an armchair quarterback. You can't sit back and, you know, just be behind your lap of throwing the throwing the ball. You need a lead from front. Show them what that actually looks like at every single level. Marcus, I'm curious. How does this attach to a lot of times people do, like, beginning of quarter goal setting or stuff like that where you're, like, building your path to president's club, for example. Is this similar to that? Do you, like, tie them together? Is that, like, a different goal setting exercise? I know you coach a lot of, like, 7 figure sellers. And, like, how do you get them to break down that path in digestible pieces? Yeah. Great. So I love that. Right? So there's a couple of things. Right? So I picture if we look at from a tier level, the very top level is actually this personal success blueprint. If you think about this, this should have a lot of personal goals. So they'll have stuff on there like, I wanna buy a new home. I wanna retire my spouse. I wanna, you know, retire by 40. I wanna stack 5,000,000 cash or whatever. You'll see the number of these things, and they really should be things that are beyond, like, let me hit my number, hit presidents club. These should be like, if they hit these things, presidents club becomes a byproduct. Hitting their number becomes a byproduct. So if they shoot for the stars land on the moon, it's the type of principle. That's how you wanna think. So the you have that as a top layer as how it all works. And then you go one below that, which is okay. Now at the company level, what's that look like? How do you deploy it from a QBR or a month or MBR or whatever? Now, one slight pivot. I actually don't like QBRs. I prefer actually MBRs monthly business reviews and set because I found in the quarter too much stuff changes. You're far far more accurate in least managing your number. So anyways, besides that point, though, so you have the the core overall personal success blueprint, and then you have your plan at your monthly business review. So that at that point, if you think about it, if they know what they're already going after, everything below in that business review should align towards hitting hitting you're hitting towards that. So from the accounts they have, they wanna go after, the deals that they need to work on, the red flags they have to worry about, their pipeline, etcetera, Everything flows together. So we don't wanna treat it as, like, separate events. It's all part of the journey of helping them get to where they wanna go. Because, ultimately, if they are clear on their executional path, they're gonna have a high likelihood to actually get to where they wanna go. But this is where there's so many systems in place that feed into each other. Right? So you have the personal success blueprint, then you have the monthly business review, like I mentioned. Right? But then on top of that, every single week, you're doing certain things as a sales leader to drive performance. And it's not just one's important to the one's important, others not important. They all feed to each other. And when you are ultimately going towards the same end goal, their North Star, their personal goals, you have a high likelihood for success. But the mistake a lot of leaders make is they don't do that. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Instead, they lead them towards the number they want them to be at, the quota, you know, the number as a team. And that's just not important to the rep, frankly. So, Marcus, you just dropped us into your weekly rhythms. Right? So it goes from, like, the personal success blueprint to the monthly plan that will get you to your number, to your goal, or your presence club. And then you have literally on a weekly basis all of the meetings or the rhythms or the trainings you're running with your sales team. And this was, like, really awesome when we were going through it in the prep. So could you just give me, like, a high level overview of the four training systems that you run on a weekly or on a monthly basis? 100%. So here's the four simple system for a culture of high performance. So number one is a winning Wednesday training session where you have a specific training session every single week in this very specific format. Number two, I call them real play Friday. So not role plays, but real play Fridays where you have a set time on Friday. We're doing full role plays that are real like a prospect every single Friday. Number three, our monthly war room. So literally on a monthly basis, bring entire team together for four hours of a targeted skill and deal progression meeting where you're helping them dig through their deals or the biggest deals in their in their pipeline, moving things forward and generating more pipeline as part of it as well. And then the fourth is a little more advanced one. It's called the Apex Club, which is creating a leadership development program that you are implementing every single month designed to prepare your AEs for the next step. So first, let's recap the four. So you have winning Wednesdays, which are just a training session. You have real play Fridays, which are two hours of, like, brute force role plays. You have monthly war rooms, which are a four hour targeted skill and deal progression. And then you have the Apex Club, which is your leadership development program. Mhmm. Let's start with the winning Wednesday training session. What are you training on? Who's running the training? What are the keys to running this right? The beautiful part is is this should be very easy to implement literally every single week. So it's a week it's a it's set on the counter for every single rep at set time. So I love Wednesdays. Right? Because, you know, reps can start off the week, you know, hopefully, kinda excited for the week, but then they get kinda run down a little bit. The Wednesday is a bit of a pick me up. Okay? So So it's gonna be a weekly transaction every single week that sets that falls in a very specific format. Now first off, before I go into that, the way you get topics is actually very easy. It's as simple as what are you seeing on calls and call views every single week? What's the team struggling with? Those are clear signs. It's not it's not you just picking like, oh, I found some interesting training on YouTube or whatever. It's like, oh, the team is struggling with this. Right? Or, oh, like, we really struggle with multithreading. We need to run a four week session on multithreading, messaging, etcetera, to really improve those skills. So you the ideas are all around you. Pay close attention. Alright? Now here's how you do it. So just to here's the structure. You start with me off very simple. So first off, before you dive into it, each AE shares a win so far in the week. So you have them go round table on the Zoom or whatever or in person. They each share a win so far in the week. And this is really, really important because this allows each aide to focus on what has been a win so far. Because sometimes if if they had a tough week so far, you know they're beating themselves up. This gives them a chance to think, okay. What was a win so far? It gets them to kinda pull themselves out of it to reframe their mind. So half the time, that mental game is like is like everything, right, if you will. So get them to reprogram that territory between their ears. So after they share a win, then you go through, you teach something specific. So the framework is first, you teach the exact framework the team needs to improve. So for instance, if I'm teaching, let's call it, you know, my objection handling framework. It's like, hey. Here's how we handle objection. It's it's h e a r t, and you explain what it is and what it's all about. Now that should be maybe five or ten minutes. So it shouldn't be it shouldn't be too complex. Give them the exact wording to say, scripting framework, etcetera, to follow. Right? Make it so simple. They can do it literally after you hear. Now here's the thing. They're gonna be skeptical depending on how how long you work with them, how much they trust you. So then you're going to role play as a leader live with your AE. And you're you want your AE to be tough. So you pick someone that you know is probably gonna bust you up a little bit, and you pick them. And say, let's go we're gonna role play now. Like, you know, like, throw me an objection. I'll be I'll be the salesperson. You be the prospect, and you do it live with them. And you know they can try throw you curveballs, and this is why you need to know yourself as a leader. So when you do it live with them and you show them how it's done, it's amazing how much trust you actually build with the team. And then the team each they go role play with each other and and for the next, like, thirty minutes. So they're actually doing it a lot. And you, again, you concurred and be tough on each other, and they provide feedback for each other, and you're just listening in. So if you're on Zoom, you're hopping in different rooms, and you're listening, giving feedback, and you're coaching just like you're watching them coach on and practice on the field. So that's really key. If you do every single week like that, you'll see a skill, increase. And at the very end of time, you pick one person to do a line for everybody. So oftentimes, that peer feedback is always the hardest. So you put them in uncomfortable environments intentionally to thicken their skin and make them better. So because you don't want them to practice on prospects. You want them to practice with each other. So you pull one person, they practice in front of everyone, everyone give them kudos, gives them feedback, and then the meeting wraps up, and they go crush the day. Dude, I imagine this being like a killer Wednesday session that most teams run maybe once a month. You're having a sales leader break down one framework, then the sales leader does the role play with an AE who's gonna grill them. So it's like, I can get grilled so you can get grilled. Then you pair them up to role play on their own. You're dropping in rooms, giving feedback, and then the team has one person go up and do the role play in front of the entire team. Correct. A lot of times with managers, some of the things that I hear is like, I can't put together a training every single week. And so how do you get the managers comfortable literally putting together a framework or full deck or something like that every single week on a grueling pace? I was for City of Spot Development. So when I was running a large org, I deployed trains all the time to make it easier for them. So I gave them PowerPoint decks and slide decks to go and train their teams with so they had tools to go and run with. That makes it a little bit easier. Right? That's a perfect situation. You have somebody who is obsessive with winning. Okay? And they're obsessed with making their org win, so they do stuff like that. Now you may not have that, which is okay. Right? So that means then as a sales leader, you have to think for yourself, okay. This is the highest one of the highest leveraged things I can do, which is make my team better. Right? That's one of those highest leveraged things you can do. That means then if you don't if you if you don't go thinking of frameworks or come with ideas like that, is then you need to go through and find stuff to show them and teach them. Right? That means you're listening to podcasts like thirty minutes of pride in this club. You're pulling one tactic out, and you're gonna practice yourself to get really good with it. Right? In reality, this is this is where this is what separates the elite from the because the average leaders will say, that sounds like too much work. Well, you're right. It is a lot of work, but you know what's even harder? When you miss your number and think we'll get a new job, that's even harder. But when you're actually really good at your job, you have longevity in your career. It's amazing how much wealth you can build because of it. Right? So it's kinda like you gotta choose your heart. What's gonna be harder? Doing this or, like, getting different job care teams not performing? So, Marcus, we got winning Wednesdays. We got this rhythm now hour every single week. Guess what? Managers, your job is to get your team better, so we're gonna give you time to do it every single week. Right? And now you move into something else, which is Real play Fridays. Real play Fridays. Now a little context around this because, when sorry. As a sales leader, this I didn't have this, by the way. Right? Because one of the things is, you know, I was doing the the weekly the winning Wednesday's training, which is great, and you're getting skill development. But sometimes if you have a bigger team, you know, my team got bigger. I found that some of the reps didn't get enough time for role plays and repetition. So what they were doing is they were just practicing on prospects, which is very dangerous thing to do. Like, you're like, you're you're putting a little out there. You're losing deals. It's not a good thing to do. Right? So, I started to implement real play Fridays. So what this was was for every new hire or anybody who's not performing and also made it open to other people is I set up, on a time on Friday for two hours to do full real plays. So these are, like, not just role plays. This is where you as a sales leader act as a toughest prospect, and you run through full snails of your reps on the discovery, demo, whatever. Right? And they're coming in and they're role playing with you, and you're just being tough on them. Right? You're getting them bloody behind closed doors. So this is, like, one some of the most valuable time to start doing it. Right? And some out there are like, oh, sounds kinda intense. It was intense. It was intentionally intense. But what's really interesting was when I started to do this, the new hires, well, we got better faster. The uninformers are performing as well, but even the top reps started coming. So they're like they could fuck that. They're like missing out because we're they're we're having fun doing it. We're, you know, like, we're doing it. And then, like, you know, we're having fun. We're, like, you know, we're laughing. We're messing up. It's like, it's not like a serious thing. It's just like, we're just trying to improve our skills. So when they saw that, they started coming as well. They started coaching the reps too. So it became part of the culture. I was it wasn't just like, you know, for underperformers and new hires. It was like, hey. If you want to increase your skills, and you have time, you don't need meetings, come join the Real Play Fridays, and we're gonna practice your skills. And the really cool part was is, like, over time, you just start to see them develop much faster. So, like, you know, I I knew, for instance, a new hire, by time I open a job requisition, but by the time they started hitting an okay number, took a hundred and fifty seven days. That's open job rec to at least closing some sort of deal. That meant I have open tenders that are underperforming. So I had to close that gap. Stuff like this helped close the gap, so they're literally closing deals. Like, what do you mean closing within our first month? So this is drastically important because I knew I was always up against the clock. If you know you already run 30% turnover every single year, you're at a disadvantage every time you have new hires. So you have to be strategic in how you constantly upscale your team and get them get them skilled as fast as possible because otherwise, you're going to miss your number. So I'm I'm I wanna do a real you convinced me. I wanna do a real play session, but I'm having trouble picturing it in my mind. I'm a have a virtual team. I've, say, 12 people on my team. Am I doing one person at a time? Are they in breakout rooms? Like, take me through how that meeting runs. Perfect. So so if you have if you had 12 people on there, that's really awesome, by the way. So most time I would have maybe two to four that come right as part of it, right? But let's imagine if you have 12. So if you have 12 people are gonna be there, then you are gonna have to get some help realistically. So that would mean, like, maybe you're taking someone who's a little more more tenured and they're gonna be the prospect. Okay. And if you need a couple people, you pick a couple of you prospect and it's gonna be some people are gonna be role playing live, and I'll write the the scenarios in advance. If you want and you want if you wanna have some fun, by the way, you pick some of the reps, and you have them write the scenarios. They love you this. They hate this record bullet points of the toughest situation you had in the last couple of weeks, and let's just have some fun with it. Right? And then it starts off very simple. So, like, okay. Let's say you have three people who are gonna be the prospects, you and two other, you know, more seasoned people. Alright. Cool. They each have a scenario. Three people are are role playing, and the other others let's call other six, that are observing. So they can hop into rooms and just observe because this is this is key. Because sometimes it's kinda like it's easier to coach other people but yourself. Right? But when they start to coach other people, they actually start to improve their own self awareness. Yeah. So it's all it's it's what it is. You're almost like watching game tapes live with each other. Right? And then, you know, once they get done, you basically reverse it. Right? And then you do enough time so this way everyone gets a chance to role play. So that can be really powerful. Now if you depending on the level of resourcing you have, if you other department heads who maybe have some sort of sales acumen or maybe, you know, how buyers buy, get them involved too. So I actually would get other people as well if I want if I was having a larger recession and get other people involved as well. So they can be a tough prospect too. Like, for example, someone from CS, get someone from CS come over who does all complaints. It's amazing how tough those role plays can be, but they get so more because they get far better skilled now because they they know it's like, okay. This is, like, this is gonna be tough. And the more you can do it, the more consistent you are, the better it's gonna be. Now it won't be easy to start doing, but you you have to make it a habit. So this is why as a sales leader, you know, you had a road to president's club. You have a set blocks in your calendar for yourself and the team so they can come in there, and you're creating an environment for success. So I'm I got my team. I'm on Zoom. I say, okay. Marcus and Arman, you guys are gonna be prospects. Susie and Sally, you guys are gonna be sellers. Go off into a breakout room or something like that. Mhmm. And then I'm gonna that, you know, some people are gonna go to one. Some people go they're gonna watch and observe and watch those role plays. Then when the role plays over, they come back together and you discuss, like, what would we learn? How can we do that better? Is that kind of how it works? So it depends on how you wanna do it. So there's no right or wrong way to do it. Okay? So, like, for instance, like, depending on how's how how good those other two people are, they're gonna be prospects. So let's just say they're pretty good reps and they're they've been around for a little bit. They're, you know, they're pretty savvy. You may wanna do all the coaching and feedback just within that room just to make it simple from a logistics perspective, not jumping around. Right? You can just do on the spot from there. But if they're not, maybe not as good, then it's gonna be like, okay. Hey. In one hour, and we're gonna circle back around, we're gonna talk about what you guys saw and and just go round table. So there's some flexibility there. You have to kinda gauge it based off the skill level of your team, to be specific. Let's talk about the monthly war room because Cool. You have a four hour skill building and deal progression meeting, and it looks like you're structuring hours one and two differently from hours three and four. So, like, what does that look like? Yeah. These are a lot of fun if you do it right. So this should be ideally, it's a it's a set time that's the same, like, you know, last Friday of every single month. It's a set time where it's four hours where you're focusing on the skills and moving deals for. So for instance here, so hours like one and two, you have each rep pull up their account plan one at a time for one large deal that's still this. So this should be, like, their top deals, maybe the top 10% of the ACV deals. You have them walk through the deal in front of everybody and then just open up for feedback and questions on the deal. So, ultimately, the cool part is that if you if the team will start to ask questions and it's like, hey. Did you do this? What about this? And and dive deeper into the deal. And when you do it together like this, what's amazing is, like, the the group think and the ideas that come from it. And the goal is you come away with a very clear actionable strategy that AE can literally go and implement literally right after. So after they go, then you have another rep go. Right? And just kinda go through until the time is up. And then hours three and four, three and four, now it's about deploying the strategy. So whatever they came up to do it came up with to do to follow in that first couple hours, now they go through and they deploy strategy. They can also go through any other stall deals. And use what happens is they're like, now the the gears are turning. They're like, oh, here's this other deal. It's really some I haven't thought through this way. Right? And they they are executing moving forward. And if they don't have enough opportunities to work, then they work on identifying, researching, and app a new opportunity to add to their pipeline. This way, you're moving your biggest deals forward, and you're generating more pipeline through a very set focus time every single month at a set time on a set day each month. You have them go do it and then come back and be like, hey. This is what happened. This is how it's working. Is there, like, kind of, like, a live stream of what's happening? You're exactly right. So depending on the team and where they are at. Right? Like, we literally would huddle every hour. Hours, you know, so hour three, they go through deploy, fifty minute timer. They bust their butt, put in the work in fifteen minutes, ten minute break. They hit the restroom, get some drinks, and they come back and we discuss how their first fifty minutes go. And what happens is there's a lot of peer accountability. Nobody wants to say, hey. You know what? The two hours you spent earlier today, I didn't do anything. Yeah. You know, they're like, this is what I did. This is lead that generated. This is why I booked. Right? And if they were booking opportunities, we'd actually have them write out who they booked, the accounts, and who is with. So this way people could see who it was. Because what happened was was especially for, like, you know, we sold to all industries. So for instance, let's just say they sold into Providence Providence Healthcare Systems to Healthcare System. Right? And they they booked a certain maybe the the clinic side. We're like, oh, okay. We also have, you know, the the, you know, the actual hospital side over this other part of the territory. So now we can reference that and that other record now call into this other opportunity. So we actually do to feed off each other. So you have to create some of the assistance for account on building such as these huddles, you know, to help deploy that. And then, you know, they fifteen minutes goes by. They go and they deploy more work. And then before they wrap up, they get together at the break, and they share the results again. And the cool part is is, like, you for sure you'll move make progress, but, like, the team is, like, buzzing because they're actually making progress. Because sometimes it gets so busy. Let's say they have a large, like, portfolio of accounts. They get so busy with the other accounts. This is, like, the focus on the biggest accounts that they have, and they're like, okay. I actually really move needle. It's a deep strategic work that you're helping them focus on because you create the environment for success. Dude, amazing show. We talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit. But our final question is this. What is one bad habit that every sales leadership breaks that all teams can get it to Presidents Club? Allowing mediocrity to seep into the team. Like, when you set the expectation standard for how things need to perform and you allow people to break that rule. And once I'm just be a stickler, be a stickler. When you allow mediocre seep into the team, you are saying it's okay to do these things. It's okay to break the rules. It's okay to not hold yourself to a certain extent. And this applies across the board. You could have a presence called level rep. And if you have the mandate, hey. We as a team, this is what we do every Wednesday to train the team, to help become better. This is what we everyone needs to do. And that top rep's like, I'm too good for that. And you allow that to happen. You're actually allowing mediocrity to happen. You're allowing them to say, the rules don't apply to me. So you have to be always very, very careful allowing them to have a mentality across the board that they have to have a growth mindset. And it starts with you as the leader. So you can say it all as you want, but how do your actions show it? And I think we discussed today as you have you seen is you leading from the front. When you lead from the front, you show expectations up here, and this is how I perform as myself. The team will follow suit, and those who can't follow suit, that's okay. You can then top grade the team and bring people in who are willing to follow that culture. Amazing show. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, folks. It's time for a three step recap and one thing you can do. Alright. Three step recap. Number one, lock in your winning Wednesdays where every single Wednesday run a one hour training with your team. You can run it. A top rep can run it. Your manager can run it. But passing this off to enablement is purely an excuse to claim that you are developing your team when in reality, you're passing it off to someone who frankly should be the one who's helping one of your top reps run the training or helping you run the training. That's number one. Number two, real play Fridays. So not role play Fridays, but two hours of intense scenarios, ideally, if you can find the prospect at your company. So if you sell to CFOs, get your CFO to come in there and be the role play partner. That's what you wanna do, and you should be getting your group in multiple, multiple, multiple reps back to back to back. Do not let your reps practice in the game. That's number two. And then lastly, number three, monthly war rooms. You're gonna block off four hours, and you're gonna take all your stall deals with your reps, and you are literally going to find a way to get them on or off. They're gonna make the calls in the room. They're gonna say exactly what they're gonna do in the room. You might do an exec over the top in the room, but you are going to move your biggest, baddest, stallest deals. Alrighty, Mark. What's one thing that people should do? Listen. I think right now what you should do is you should find your buyer persona in your company. You should buy them lunch. You should go interview them and ask them how they might make a purchase, like what with what you sell. Right? And then set up some time to do some role plays. This is an interesting little exercise that we used to do at outreach. When we'd onboard SDRs and AEs and do prospecting, we would have them call me and the other VPs of sales in the company, and they had to book a meeting. And anybody that booked a meeting got a $100 bonus during onboarding. It was amazing how much more dialed in the cold calls were, and you could give great coaching. So find some people in your company that are your buyer persona and see if you can line them up to do some real plays. And, folks, if you want another clinic on how to run great practice sessions and role plays, I've got two resources for you. I believe the first ever leadership episode we recorded was with the legendary KD Kevin Dorsey on how to run practice sessions and role plays. If you haven't listened to that leadership episode, sometimes those first ones are just goodies. So go listen to that one. And then we also put together a full newsletter with KD on how he runs those in written form. So go check that out, folks. And if you like what you see, the number one way that you can support the show is by clicking that subscribe button on YouTube right now because that is where we're focusing a lot of our attention. It tells the algorithm that you like what we're doing, and we do more stuff like this. Alrighty, folks. Peace.
