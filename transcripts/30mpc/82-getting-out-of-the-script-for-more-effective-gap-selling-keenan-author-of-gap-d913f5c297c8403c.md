## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigalski. And today, I got the one and only, Keenan, for a round two. The man, the Gap seller himself. Nick, why should people listen? Arman, contrary to popular belief, I'm actually not a perfect seller a 100% of the time. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive goes to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. And today, Keenan and I workshopped a time that I kinda botched a discovery call. So this was a really good episode for me because I got to learn and, like, get some one on one coaching with Keenan, and you all can learn from my mistakes. Three, two, one. Nick not perfect, but I am. Alright, Keenan. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Actionable takeaways. Oh my goodness. Let me go with this. I think the very first one is ask problem centric questions, not process questions or questions like a product focused question. So what does that mean? It It means ask questions that are gonna quickly get you to the place where you can diagnose their problem. It's asking questions that will steer the buyer to what is the reason they're on this call in the first place. Whether they inbound it and said, hey. I'm interested in your software, your application, your product, or you outbounded them and got them to say, alright. I'll give you thirty minutes of my time. What you need to understand is if someone's on the call with you, whether inbound or outbound, and they're giving you thirty minutes, forty five minutes, an hour, they're giving you something. So they believe that they have a problem big enough that they're willing to give you that time. That's money. That's they're paying you, basically. Right? They're paying you. So you would better ask questions that find out why. Get to the problem. Why? Why are they on this call? What problems are they struggling with? Okay? The second one then is fill out a picture. That's a gap selling thing, but it's alright. You'll learn it quick. Picture. Problem identification chart. And, basically, the problem identification chart is made up of three things. It's made up of the problems that your product or service solves, the business problems, people, the business problems that your product or service solves. Secondly, what is the impact to an organization if those problems exist? So then you write that down. So think three columns. First column is the problem that your product or service or company fixes. Next column, impact. If those problems exist in an organization, what is the impact to that organization? How does those problems manifest themselves? In the last column, fill out the root causes. What creates those problems? K? When you do that, that then gives you a compass to ask problem centric questions like I just told you before. You fill that out. You memorize that. That is gonna be your top track and your compass to having business dialogue as opposed to product dialogue. K? And the last one, stop using VAN. Just cut it out. Stop asking if they have budget. Stop asking if they're the authority. Stop asking what the need is. Stop asking when they're looking to get this done. You look like a clown. Cut it out. So I wanna run a scenario by you. I recently started a new job, and I had, like, one of my first discovery calls with somebody. I outbounded this, pretty big law firm that I like, our whole company's been trying to get into, and I went right to the CEO. I was calling the CEO. I was calling the CEO, and he actually replied to one I one of my emails. We had a decent dialogue back and forth. And he said, hey, Nick. This sounds kinda interesting. I'm gonna connect you with one of our finance managers. And he cc'd the guy and he said, hey, finance manager, Arman, take a call with Nick. Maybe he can help with the problem you and I talked about the other day. So I get on the Zoom. I've got my big smile. I did all of my research. We build a little rapport for, I don't know, ninety seconds. And then I've always been taught to start the discovery call with, well, hey. You know, I've got certain things I wanna learn from you today, but you're the customer. And so you probably have stuff you wanna get out of this call. What would you like to accomplish today? And the guy starts peppering me with all of these questions that were like the one of the first things he asked me was about our, like, software service level agreements. Like, are, you know, Odie, you have 99.9% uptime? And I'm like, it just completely threw the thing awry. So he's asking me about SLAs and pricing and nothing to do with, like, the actual problem. And, honestly, the call sort of ended up bombing, and I was a little embarrassed. But I figured maybe it can help me fix what the heck happened there. The first question you said to him is, what do you wanna get out of this meeting? The minute you asked that question, you were dead in the water. Dead in the water. Here's why. Was your original dialogue back and forth with him? No. Who was it with? It was with the CEO. So how much do you think he understands about where you're at? He had a he had, like, a decent understanding. What he said to me, like, in the beginning of the call was, well, I came from a different law firm, and I felt like that law firm like, we had it together more than where we are right now. And I sat down with the CEO who recently started with this company. I told him if we implement a stricter time entry policy, we'll make more money. And so maybe your product can help with that. You got caught in a script because he told you that they came from another place and it was more buttoned down. Right? He told you that he told the CEO that if we could get a better time management or time billing system, we could make more money. With those two things alone, when you were done with your little pleasantries, you should have simply asked, hey, man. Tell me what you mean by a more button down. Could you explain me what you had and where are you today? And is the reason for that, Keenan, because I made an assumption about what he meant on that, and I should have asked him to clarify, like, what that term meant? Yes. Absolutely. Because that's the problem. Like, that's your current state problem. When he says, we had this. I think we could do this. We could make more money. What he just did is he circled a big red circle around where the problem is, but he just didn't show it to you. So what do you mean it was more buttoned down over here? Right? And so he's like, well, we could do this. We could do that. We could do this. Oh, can you do that now? No. What's the difference? Well, now we can't do this. We can't do this. So where do you think how do you think that's affecting you from a revenue perspective? I think we're probably leaving 15 revenue on the table. Really? 50% of what? Well, we do. We build $75,000,000 a year. So you mean you can make about $9,000,000 on the table that's like it was done. You could have got that whole thing done in twelve minutes. Well, instead, what ended up happening was towards the end of the call, he's asking me what it costs, and I was trying to then at the end of the back half of the call being like, well, wait a minute. Let's talk about, like, how folks justify the ROI here because I said the average firm captures this much more billable time, and I'm dead in the water there. Right? By the time you got to the end, you couldn't. Right? So let me help you out again. So this is what you should have done. K? So you should first off, everybody's message here was don't get caught in a script. The mere fact that he told you all of that information, you either assumed it or just moved past it to get to the script. Oh, what I really like to do is before I do this and this and this, I'd like to see what you'd like to get out of the call. That's a script, dog. So once you did that script so first, don't do the script. I gave you the way to handle it before. He gave you the information. You should have jumped right when he started talking. K? Number two, once you did find yourself down that script and he started asking about SLAs, etcetera, you could have stopped and said, Tommy, we do have an SLA, but I find it interesting that's the very first question you asked. Could you walk me through what's behind that and what you're looking more common with an SLA? Because the reason like, I had it in my brain. I was like, it's really weird that he's asking about that this early. And I should have asked him, why are you asking me this so early? Yes. Yes. What's going on? Have you had these things before and they don't stay up? Like, walk me through. And as he's giving you those answers, dude, that's your way to get it back to problem centric. Right. He's going to talk about how they've gone down. I'm gonna guess, but I'm gonna talk he's talking about how it's gone down. And because it went down, they lost x amount of billings that they weren't expecting, or they spent so much time trying to get it back up that they lost billing and they couldn't bill, so they lost time to cash because not only did they lose the billing, but it took them a while to figure out who they had to bill, blah blah blah. So then that gives you the conversation, like, so let's talk about this billing piece. How are you guys doing it today? Like, let's forget about this. How are you doing today? How much do you think you're losing? Like, it was a natural move back to the business problem. Right. So, Keenan, I'm curious because, naturally, they're gonna have questions for us, and some of them will be valid questions. And they probably wanna know a little bit about how we can solve their problems. And so are you withholding how you could potentially solve the problems until you go all the way twenty minutes deep into understanding the deep impact of those problems? Are you doing a little bit of give and take along the way? Maybe a little give and take, maybe. And I'm not withholding because I'm a gap seller and what you do is gap sell. I'm withholding because the genuine answer, the genuine honest answer is, I don't know if I can help you. I don't know what the problem is. Like, people I had to look. I had this happen all the time. People come up and say, Cam, I need your advice, man. You know, my wife and I were fighting all the time. Husband and I are fighting all the time. I I I really know what need to do. Can you help me out? Like, I think I need to get divorced. What do you think? You know what my answer is every time? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what you should do. Tell me what's going on. Why are you guys fighting? How long you've been fighting? What have you done to fix it in the past? How did that work out? It ends up being a long conversation so I can truly understand where you are, what you've done, how you got here, what the root causes are, how it's impacting you, what you actually wanna get out of it. It's like a gap sell. And And then when I hear it, I'm like, okay. Now now I'll give you my opinion because I feel comfortable that my opinion will be well versed and well based and that what I suggest is a good solution. So the same thing with what you sell as products and services. Right? He may sit be sitting there talking to you about SLA, but guess what? Let's just see if the best SLA in the world. But his problem as far as capturing his billable hours may be something you can't fix or maybe a problem you're not really well designed at. Or better yet, maybe let's say they get 98% of their billings already, and the 2% only comes out to 30,000 a year. Yeah. We could probably fix it, but not for the cost. So I wouldn't recommend this. But I can't say that unless I understand what's going on. So I'm not withholding. I'm basically trying to say, if you want my advice, if you want me to help you in the sale, I need to understand what's going on because I don't trust you that you know the problem. So the question you're asking me may think are helping you, but you don't understand. So, Keenan, I'm curious. What do you do in this situation when you get to the end of your discovery call or you get halfway through, and you're like, shoot. For Nick's solution, you're not losing a million billable hours. Right? But there is this, like, really annoying process problem that people have that I think they might wanna solve even if it's not saving a million dollars of billable hours. How do I sort of evoke the nose early on? Or, like, what do I do in a situation like that when I'm stuck with mostly process problems? Well, process problems always manifest themselves in a business problem. They they don't live apart. And if they don't manifest into a business problem, then you don't have a problem, and so you don't sell. So what you've just described is the size of the gap. If it's saving a million dollars, it's a really big gap. If it's only saving a $100,000 or it's it's billing things faster, so therefore your day sales outstanding goes from forty five days to thirty days, which means you have that's 50% more cash on hand. If it's simply customer service and people feel like they're, being treated better and your customer service ranking goes from an eight to a nine, that gets you in the, NPS. Yeah. Yeah. NPS score. Thank you very much. Right? So maybe they get your NPS score higher. Right? Or maybe it's simply, because remember, billing plays a big role in in partners. So maybe at the end of the day, it's just helping them better understand who the partners are. I mean, with the partner decision process and promoting people from the socialist to partners faster. So my point is notice where my head is in this entire conversation. And it's just I don't know. I'm not a lawyer, but I I know enough of them that notice all these conversations are my me pulling from my understanding how a law firm works. Where could billing negatively or positively impact a law firm? Customer sat, addition of, new attorneys, days sales outstanding. You see what I'm saying? And that you you just have to understand what that nuisance is, my man. Like, I'm not the key here is you use the word nuisance. You have to define that. You cannot just accept that as a term. What is a nuisance about and how big is the nuisance? And you'll determine whether or not it's worth paying for your product. So you talked about in that scenario that I I botched the the definition of the term, like, when the guy said we were more buttoned up at a different firm. And you were like, boom, Nick. There's your big red circle of something you've gotta dig into. Can you talk about, like, how you identify what those are? Like, are there common trigger points when somebody says something you're like, that's it. I gotta go after that? He's literally saying, this is where I was. This is where I am now. This isn't as good. Like, that is such a trigger for me. Like, it's just locked and loaded. I I would never miss out in a heartbeat. Oh oh, boom. Bam. Like, I'm in. So I I don't know how to teach that to someone. Like, you can't sit and be like, okay. Listen for the comparative analysis. You just have to learn to train your mind that anybody time someone suggests in any way, shape, or form that where they are today is not optimal, jump. Jump. In any way, shape, or form, today is not optimal. Listen. When you look at gap selling, that's the whole point, current state, future state. Right? The current state discovery is literally designed to not under okay. To understand where they are, yes, but understand where they are and why it's not optimal, why it's not where they want to stay. That's the point of the current state, not just to get a bunch of stupid information. It's to highlight the fact that where you are now, the status quo, is not acceptable. And therefore, you must change if you want this, the desired outcome. Then he might say, well, look, man. We used to do it over here and okay. Now okay. Got it. Mhmm. We used to do it over here. And by the way, watch this. When somebody says, I used to do it over here, it was better. Right? Or I used to date this girl, and she was way cool, and the girl I'm dating now isn't that cool. Believe it or not, when they say this person over here or when I had it over here, that's not past state. That's desired future state. They wanna get back to where they were, so that is desired future state. They're just using that as a benchmark to highlight what the desired future state looks like. So it's actually they're giving you the desired future state by telling you how it used to be, and I wanna get back there, and I'm not there now. So let's say I get all the way to the end, and I've got some big business problems that I can solve. And so I know that there's this massive loss of billable hours today. And the last part of the pick is bringing them back to the root causes. Right? And one thing you always say is you always say, like, hey. Don't ask people to self diagnose. So can you tell me more about what I should be doing instead? So once you find the problem, right, and you know they're losing all these billable bottles, then you ask process questions. This is where process questions come in. I love process questions after the problem questions. So you admit this. It's alright. Tell me a little bit about how the team is is billing hours now. So so and then I did get more. That's why I'm understanding the business is important. Then I I'd listen to you for a while and based on what you said, I might ask more questions or I might say, okay. That makes sense. Tell me about this. How does how does your your how do your lawyers today, if someone calls in and has a ten minute conversation with more five minute conversation in between two other clients who are doing hour, two hours of billing. How do you capture that today? Right? And then at bay and they describe it to him and say, okay. Because it's such a small thing and it's interrupted, do you believe that your attorneys probably only capture that 50% of the time? You see what I'm doing? I'm asking process questions because process or tool questions because those give me the root causes. And then when the buyer says, yeah. I I'm pretty sure only 50% do it because it's only ten minutes Right now, it takes too long. So so I'd say, how would they capture that normally? And they would explain it. It's probably cumbersome and difficult where they're supposed to go into their app, but they they know the guy that's had him for an hour is now. The other guy's coming in an hour, and they just it's not worth it to them to go into the do this and do that, so they just let it go. And then if your product is simply a button on their phone, what makes that process to capture that ten minutes is a far less cumbersome. You see what I'm saying? Then you show them why you'll capture that now. Root cause, interruptions for ten minute calls. We bill them ten minute increments, but they just pass it on because it's stuck between two big ones. Wait. You can capture that in one step? Oh my god. You see what I did there, guys? Yeah. Root cause is how you demonstrate your product, but you gotta ask process questions to dig into how they're doing the things today that are causing the problems and then show how you fix them. I mean, you're gonna wanna strangle me, but I'm not even doing that. I'm just having people be like, yeah. I know our attorneys aren't getting everything. Like, I've never proposed a scenario like the one you did where it's like, alright. They're in a meeting. They take a quick phone call, and then they go right to the next meeting. I'm I haven't asked that, and you're gonna scream at me through the computer here. Listen. I don't sell to lawyers. Mhmm. Okay? What I do know is that when I'm selling or helping people sell, all I'm thinking about is the person I'm selling to. I'm literally putting myself into their position. I'm literally trying to problem solve on the fly. So I say to myself on the fly, I just trying to help you. Right? And what little I know about how attorneys bill. I know they bill on ten ten minute increments. Some are even trying to get it smaller. Right? So there's another potential thing. Are you trying to the reason they do ten minutes, I think, is eight or five or three are too difficult to bill. Like, it's just the time it takes to bill for that student. Right? So they're doing it 10 increments. I know that. Then I think to myself, well, if they're doing a ten minute increments, how many ten minute increments do they get in a day compared to longer increments? And if there's a really small one, I wonder half the attorneys just say, it's ten minutes. Keena just called. I don't have time for this right now. It's not gonna kill me. I gotta take care of this stuff. That's all I did was I literally just put myself in the position of the people I'm selling to and ask myself what types of scenarios could undermine billing. And then I say, okay. Are you struggling with these types of problems? You know, when when you talk about, I gotta get in the shoes of this person, you might have a partner of a law firm that you're talking to, and those massive business problems mean it under that partner. But then you might have, like, an accounts payable specialist or, like, an administrative manager who literally has to collect these time sheets. And sometimes they feel like they just care about I spend all this time and all of my time solving this problem. And so are you educating them on, like, hey. If you wanna solve this problem for you, you have to solve a bigger problem for the partner, or how do I go in the situation when they're they're stuck in more of, like, a technical problem? I do both. So I start with their prop. So if if you're the person who wants to input it all day, I start with, well, tell me how long it takes you to input the stuff. Right? Well, better yet, I'm okay. Here. I just did it again. I just did it again. I put myself in their shoes, and besides taking a long time, my guess is reconciliation is a huge issue. Like, they said this, is this accurate? Right? So I then say, how do you reconcile or ensure for accuracy? Does that take you a long time? And they may say, oh, no. I got that nailed. Oh, no. We just trusted my customer. Okay. Then not a problem. But I'm literally trying to go to you and your role now, and what are the things I think are driving you crazy and making you want to change? And once I figure out how you wanna change, then I can go to the upstream effect. So this is the effect that you hear. Now because of these things, how much do you think it affects overall billing? How much do you think it affects day sales outstanding? How much do you think it affects, accuracy or having to get people money back or give free billing in the future because you overbilled or you underbilled? Like, it all comes back to business problems anyways. Right. And what do you do or is there anything that reps can learn from a delivery or from the art standpoint to make it so that I mean, you hear reps ask these ridiculous cringy questions where it's like, what would you do with all that time back in your calendar? Oh, I think too long. You know, those horrible ones. So from a delivery standpoint, how do I ask these questions in a way that doesn't make prospects feel like I'm put on defensive and you're just trying to get me to, like, cough up money that I'm about to lose so that you guys can sell me something? Go back and listen to the questions in this podcast that I've asked you. They're not cringey. I'm trying to understand. Right? And so I don't have to then turn around and ask a cringe worthy question. What would you do with all that time, right, with all that money? It really doesn't matter. If I know that you're losing a million dollars a year, I might ask, okay. Where is this million dollars affecting the organization now? If I wanted to know that, right, or if you guys got this million dollars back, are there projects or other types of things that you haven't been able to execute because of this, or would this just go straight back to the partners? So you see what I did there? I basically showed I understand your business, and partners take they all share the the profits, right, because they're LPs. So I might just did this all go back to the partners, and therefore, the return to the partners is gonna be higher, or there's some projects you'd like to allocate this money to? Right? But just don't ask stupid questions. What would you do with this? Oh, I wanna punch someone's nose out. It's just obnoxious. Yeah. In your questions, you're doing a good job of of not assuming that you know the problem. You don't know the problem. Because you don't know the problem. But at the same time, you're you're somehow still weaving in. I get your business. Right? Because I know this could go a couple of different ways. Right? Is it going to the partners, or is it going towards some other sort of project? Right? And And so when I'm asking questions, like, what's the right way to, like, weave in, like, you know, like, I know a thing or two about your business, so I can demonstrate a little bit of credibility here. No. See, this is what salespeople try to do. They try to they try to put on a a show. They try to act. Don't don't try to show. Just listen and ask questions. And legit if it's a legitimate question, like, here's a million dollars you really wanna know, you're like, okay. If you're able to get this million dollars back, is this money that's going to the partners or there there are other capital projects you're looking to spend this on? That's legitimate question. That's not a question that says I'm trying to show you I know your business. The minute you get into I'm trying to show your business, it's, again, it's about you. It's inauthentic. Again, making it about you. I I don't know how else to explain to salespeople to stop making it about you and trying to show credibility and trying to get the product sold and get them to close, just cut it out. Pretend you're a doctor whose only objective is to provide the best help to save their life and maximize their quality of life. And then that's all you gotta do. All you gotta do. If you are committed to that, everything else happens by default. You look like you have credibility because you do because you're genuinely asking a legitimate question for their benefit, not yours. Alright, Keenan. So I I know you love product demos. It's your favorite thing. And so, but naturally, I guess you have you probably have a perspective on it. And so I've got the problems. I've got the business impact. I got the root cause. Eventually, I actually have to show them how to solve this problem. How do I show them how to solve this problem without losing sight of the business impact and just getting only stuck in process problems while I'm demoing? Okay. So you know the answer, but I'm gonna clear it for you. So I look. People think I don't like showing the product. I love showing the product. I just don't like showing it too soon. Right? I love showing it when I know it can be customized, and I know exactly what's important to them. Right? So once I do that, it all goes through the root cause. So I use an example we had on the table already. You told me that you're you believe you're losing 50% of the ten to fifteen minute billable hours that happen when a customer calls out of nowhere. It's supposed to be a one minute call and then it gets stuck on it for ten or fifteen minutes. Or a quick email. Someone sits down to write a quick email, and it takes five to ten minutes, and you fill you 50% of those, and it's costing you 2 or $3,000,000 a year in billings across your 150 attorneys. That's what you believe. Right now, there's your business problem. The impact, obviously, is all that money. Right? The root cause is because your current system requires eight or nine steps. I'm just making this up. It requires x amount of steps that make the attorneys feel it's not worth their time to go do those steps to capture that ten minutes. Because in their head, in that moment, it's just ten minutes. I don't need the $50. Not thinking or not aware that they do it a thousand times or a 100 times in a year. Okay? Times all those employees. Those all those, yeah, lawyers. In the demo, what you do is you say, hey. One of the things I'd like to show you or the next thing I wanna show you, the first thing I wanna show you is you said that you believe you're losing a million dollars because of that ten minute tossed incremental billing time because it takes too long to capture that ten minutes. I wanna show you how we can get that ten minutes captured in one click of a button from their cell phone as the client's calling in. You see what I did right there? Now they already know. I already told them. So if we can if you can do this, you'll get those ten minutes back. They've already played all the way up. They already know. Okay. I get ten minutes back. This is this because you set them up. That's how you do it at demo. You literally start with the the root cause to the problems that you found, and they'll already know that I'm solving the problem. Yeah. I don't need to do the rest. Did that make sense or mine? 100%. I got a lot of good free consulting from you today. Thank you. We're running out of time, though. We gotta move to the final question. Final question is this, and you actually covered a lot of this today, but we talked about a lot of things people salespeople should be doing, and I wanna flip that on its head. The last question is what's one bad habit that you see a ton of salespeople exhibiting that they need to stop doing because it hurts them more than it helps? Not listening and being in a script. I think it's a big way based on what we do with you. Not listening and being in script. They're just running around, waiting for the next question, try saying I do a discovery, so let me get to my next question. And they're really not active listening, and then they're just going to the next question or the next step, and they're in a script or a process. And it and they're completely not connected to the buyer. Beautiful. Anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? Plug? I'm not good at plugging. Promote yourself, man. Yeah. Yeah. It look. If you're if you wanna get better at selling, you wanna be a gap seller, and your company is too cheap to invest in you, go to gap selling online training and sign up. It's me. It's six hours of online training. Go at your own pace. It's interactive so you can literally, like I'll ask you a question and up pops up. And if you answer it one way, you get a different answer. You answer it another way, you get another one. So it's super interactive. I yell at you. I take you in different directions. You have the same exercise you have to do. We score the exercises. So if you're actually committed to getting better beyond just reading the book. Beautiful. Folks, definitely go check that out. I know Keenan has helped both me and Armand a lot get better as salespeople. So thanks for listening, and stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Keenan include, number one, don't talk about the root causes and the technicalities of your problem until you get to the impact on the business first, and then talk about why this thing is happening in the first place. Number two, stop overcomplicating the problems you solve into the process and the spreadsheets and all this other stuff. Deduce what the heck your problem solves in one sentence. And then number three, stop asking questions about the past state so much. Stop getting people to wallow in what's behind them. Instead, be keenly aware of any statement that is indicative of their desired future state. And then lastly, number four, if someone's asking you about weird stuff upfront like, hey. Do you have a 99.99995 SLA upfront? You should probably ask them, hey. Is there a reason you're asking me this stuff upfront? Because there's probably a reason. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? Well, Armand, we're we're talking about SLAs. And did you know that we have a 100% SLA? We've never missed an episode. We've been publishing for a year and a half, and you and I have never once missed publishing an episode, and we don't intend to start anytime soon. But the thing is we've put out so many episodes, our audience is having trouble keeping up. So my recommendation to you, my esteemed listener, is go back, scroll a little bit. Yes. It might tire your thumb out a bit, but if you scroll back and back and back, you could even find Keenan's first appearance on the show. You could find our good friend Kyle Coleman talking about email best practices. You could listen to Richard Harris talking about the question behind the question. We have a whole host of amazing episodes, and we highly recommend you listen to them. Until next week, we'll see you on thirty minutes to President's Club.
