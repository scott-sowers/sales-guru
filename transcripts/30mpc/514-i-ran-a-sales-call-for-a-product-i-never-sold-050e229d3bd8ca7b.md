## Transcript

Gonna teach you how to run a sales call for a product that I've literally never sold before. And so at the end of this video, you will know, one, the exact problems that we would need to uncover. Two, the exact questions we could ask to uncover those problems. And then three, I'll walk through my entire thought process so that you can go build a discovery call script or framework or sales call framework for your own. So I'm gonna use an industry that I think most people watching this video would, like, understand. This company is a software company that helps people do easier background checks. Pretty straightforward. Before you hire someone, you kinda wanna make sure that they're not a serial killer. Alright? And so the company example that I will use is Checkr. I have no proprietary information about this company whatsoever. They have not given me any information around how they run discovery calls, so I'm not cheating here. So step number one is I actually wanna understand the problems that Checkr solves, and doing background checks is not a problem. And so if you've ever wondered, like, the key to starting a good discovery call is you need to be able to identify what problems you solve before you start thinking about what questions you ask. If you just start thinking about questions, you are not going to know what questions to ask because you don't know what to ask about. A question is simply a tool to uncover a problem. The easiest way to find a problem is usually companies on their pages, unless they have a good web page, they typically pitch feature benefit. Streamline your hiring with the fastest, most accurate background checks. The easiest way to find a problem is you just invert the feature benefit into a problem. So instead of streamline your hiring with the fastest, most accurate background checks, the opposite of that would be slow down your hiring with the slowest, most inaccurate background checks, and that probably tells me the types of problems that checker solves. They're probably solving problems like background checks take too long or background checks are inaccurate. So usually, most websites have what I call, like, a three pillar pitch, which is like first problem we solve, second problem we solve, third problem we solve. So let's go through their three pillar pitch. The first one is, like, get results in minutes, not days. Well, that's a benefit. The problem would be your background checks are taking days, not minutes. Right? So it's very slow. The second one says automate repetitive and manual work. This could be, like, get stuck doing manual work for a really long time. So these first two are actually both kinda related to time savings, so I might lump those two together. Then you have lower your compliance risk. The opposite of that would be have very high compliance risk or be noncompliant. K? And it looks like their background checks allow you to, like, have different types of background checks. And my guess, not knowing a lot about this company, is, like, different states or countries for sure or cities maybe or certain industries require, like, more stringent background checks than others. I know that sometimes it's like a simple background check. Other times, it's like a much longer, like, FBI history or something like that if you're working for the CIA. Right? And then the third is upgrade the candidate experience. Reduce candidate drop off with, mobilized background checks, report transparency, and dedicates. The opposite of this would be have a really crappy candidate experience. Alright? So those are my three different problems that I'm gonna work with. So let's talk about how to turn this into a discovery call framework. There are three levels of discovery. And the first level of discovery is what I usually call a situation. A situation has nothing to do with the problem they have. It might be like doing background checks, for example. There's no problem associated with doing background checks. It's literally just like how they do the thing today. Second is the problem, and I usually like to specifically call this the operational problem. So the operational problem is the day to day problem that's sort of like a pain in the butt for your champion or something that no one would want to do or something that prevents you from doing something else. So, for example, it might be like slow background checks or, like, bad candidate experience. Those are, like, annoying operational problems, but they don't really impact the business. So the final thing is you take the executive problem or the business impact. In this case, I'll call it the executive problem. And the executive problem is like, what happens because of the operational problem? So if you have very slow background checks, maybe you can't hire as quickly as you like. And so let's start at the situation level. K? So I'm gonna assume that we're going against someone who's, like, already doing background checks. K? So for the sake of today, I'm gonna say that you're doing background checks. K? From there, we need to write down our three operational problems. So the first operational problem is my background checks are too slow. They either take, like, way too time long to turn around or, like, they require a bunch of manual work for me. So, like, that's the first problem. The second problem that we might need to hit on is we need to hit on the fact that they're noncompliant. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. So there might be some, like, jurisdiction where, I don't know, you need to do, like, a sex offender search or something like that, and you have to go to, like, a different background check provider for that. The third one would be bad candidate experience. K? Bad candidate experience okay and so for that one it's like our background checks are like sent into a black box the candidates like did it go through I don't even get notified when it goes through and like candidates probably, like, freaking out about all this stuff. Okay? So these are all, like, operational problems, but, like, none of these have a so what behind it. So, like, let's ask ourselves, like, so what? Like, what happens because of each of these problems? So the first thing I'm gonna ask myself is if background checks are too slow, what could go wrong because of that? Well, if these are typically being done in hiring is I might be wondering, is this like holding up hires or, like, slowing down hiring, which is really problematic. If I'm trying to hire a triple a engineer and I'm holding up hiring because I don't have a background check, I'm going to get lit up as an HR leader by my engineering leaders. Like, what the heck? Like, you think this guy wearing the Patagonia vest over here was a serial killer? I was like, come on. Let's get this person on board. That's number one. The other one is, like, if this is truly, like, a big scale organization, you gotta think, like, thousand plus employees. If you're hiring, like, a 100 people a year and, like, you have a very manual background check process where, like, I don't know, someone needs to, like, manually check every single report every day, manually check off certain fields or approve certain fields that aren't automated, I might literally have a dedicated people operations person who is, like, 50 focused on, like, my job is, like, clicking the button on the background check thing. And I've seen this stuff in HR teams where, like, sometimes there's just so much manual work that literally, like, half of a person's job is just, like, clicking a button all day. So that really hits on, like, cost. Right? And it's cost by people. K? So that's how you turn a time savings problem into a so what problem is it's usually, like, how much time does that cost? And oftentimes, that's, like, a 5 figure amount. You really wanna find, like, 6 figure problems. Usually, like, turning time savings into cost savings is not a massive amount unless it's a huge problem. Usually, you wanna hit on things like risk or things that impact top line or, like, replacing other products so, like, you get big cost savings or big revenue jumps or big risk mitigation. Those are the 6 figure problems. So this second bucket over here, I actually think is gonna get that a little bit more. So this noncompliant bucket. What could go wrong if you're noncompliant? You could get sued. That is a 6 figure problem. That has three zeros in front of it, and that is probably the biggest thing that you need to do. There's also a cost element of this due to time or more background checks. Because if your current background check provider isn't compliant in this state, you now need to take the time to go find another provider who's probably more expensive. You gotta pay for a separate background check provider, and it's, like, costing your team a bunch of operational headaches and time, which costs money. Alright. So there's a cost angle there, but I would rather hit the don't get sued angle. Like, that's like the moment someone you mentioned, like, we're about to get sued to finance. They're usually like, okay. Fine. Spend the money. But it's like, the HR person is spending too much time. They're like, yeah. That's what I hired you to do. The third one is bad candidate experience. I'm not gonna lie. I think this is kind of the BS problem. Of the three, maybe it's better. Sure. What I would say is what happens because of the bad candidate experience? Well, you'd have a candidate with a bad taste in their mouth, and I would ask, has there ever been, like, a finish line drop? And what I mean by a finish line drop is usually when you're at the finish line with a with a candidate where, like, you've really been trying to get them on board and it's, like, neck and neck between you and someone else, like, everything needs to go right. And, like, I've had times where someone, like, typoed an offer letter, and it just, like, created a whole cloud of doubt around the hiring process. And you can lose a hire because, like, something administrative went wrong and they just get spooked by it. So, like, that's probably what I would hit on. Like, otherwise, like, I don't think there's a big executive problem behind it. Alright? So those are our three layers of problems. So now the question is, like, how do I ask discovery questions to navigate what I call these discovery trees. Okay? So I'm gonna switch pen here, and we're gonna go through my two or three favorite types of questions. Right? So the first type of question is what I just call a typically question or a multiple choice question. And so if I jumped on a call, I would ask why they took the call, and they might say something along the lines of, like, like, you know, we're doing background checks, but it's, like, kinda cumbersome, and it feels like the solution doesn't scale with us super well. And it's, like, not really a problem. It's just, like, a fuzzy concept of, like, this doesn't scale, and it's kind of annoying. So I need to, like, turn that into a more specific operational problem. And so I'll be like, hey. Totally get it. People come around here all the time when their background check process doesn't scale. Typically, when someone is having frustrations with their current process, they're either frustrated because it's, like, way too slow and manual. They're actually worried about compliance issues because they can't do all the checks they need for all the different, like, states that they're hiring in. Or, like, both of those things are fine, but, like, the candidate experience is just, like, horrendous. Like, someone thinks they're getting fished when they're getting a background check. Like, which of the three is it for you? And what this does is, like, when you suggest, like, the menu of problems someone could have, like, if you've ever played that carnival game where you, like, drop the ball and it, like, starts to bounce in the pegs, like, you start to get them to go through the pegs that you want them to go through. Nine times out of 10, if you construct this question, right, like, they'll give you one of these three or they'll give you one more that you didn't think of. But, like, if you've built your trees the right way, like, these three problems should be collectively exhaustive for most of your typical questions. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. So let's pretend that they give me the problem that I want in this case. And in this case, the problem that I want again is, like, the noncompliant problem. They'll be like, honestly, like, we're doing a lot of hiring in Louisiana, and Louisiana's got some, like, crazy background check requirements. Or we're, like, in the financial space. Like, we work for a stock market, and, like, we need to make sure that no one has conflicts of interest, so we have to do, like, these types of background checks. I'd be like, great. Now what I need to do is I need to turn that operational problem into an executive problem. My favorite way to do that is by asking what I call a magic moment question. And so, usually, the bridge between a five figure problem and a six figure problem is an emotional, painful story. A story is also usually the bridge between the operational problem, which is just like, I can't do this, to an executive problem, when did that blow up? So stories are usually the bridge between an operational problem and an executive problem. K? So what I might ask is, like, hey. Totally get it. We wanna make sure that you're totally compliant on all your background checks. Random question for you. Like, my guess is, like, you didn't wake up yesterday and be like, we cannot do background checks for, like, any of these people in finance. I'm curious. Like, when did you actually realize that this was a problem? Was, like, there's something that was missed in a background check and was someone actually noncompliant? Was there any, like, legal risk or anything like that? Or is it just something that you know you need to do to prevent that stuff? And nine times out of 10, you'll get an answer that sounds like, oh my god. I was just brought on as a new HR leader, and I was looking at our background checks that we're doing as a a financial company. And I was like, we have not checked a single person to make sure they don't have a conflict of interest. And I saw the other day when someone was talking about trading options on one of the tickers that we literally, like, represent. And so it's like you'll get some story like that that will lead to an executive problem, or they'll be like, no. But I know we need to do this, and I need to prevent that executive problem. K? So there are three types of executive problems that are worth going over here. Like, the first is this is a risk executive problem. Like, this is risk. And then the second type is cost. The third type that's not pictured here is revenue. So there are three ways that executives typically make decisions. Does it make me money? Does it save me money? Or does it prevent me from getting sued? In this case, we're trying to prevent this person from getting sued, and there's also a cost element with time savings. So let's pretend that, like, we go through that. At the end of this, they're like, oh my god. I've got this massive problem. Great. Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tell a story and be like, hey. Totally get it. We've worked with a few other, like, multinational organizations, or we work with some other folks in the fintech space where, like, oftentimes, all of their, like, normal GNA tech employees, they haven't worked for companies like this before, and so they assume that they have to do normal types of background checks. But, like, we can make sure that especially for your folks who are in operations who are seeing that data, we've helped other companies do the right types of background checks for those people without going overboard on all the other g and a people who, like, don't need those crazy extensive background checks. So we'll show you exactly what that looks like, but just so you know, like, we solved that problem before. I wanna go back to something else, and that's when you pivot to the next problem. So you go, like, situation, problem, executive problem. You tell a story, and then you pivot to the next problem. And so at this point of the call, I will probably go and pivot to the too slow, and I'll run the same flow. I'll get to the bottom. I'll tell a story. And then at the end of, like, the discovery portion, call it the twenty minute mark, I'm gonna recap. Great. So, like, you're doing background checks manually today. The two problems you shared is that you can't be compliant, which means this. You're too slow, which means this. And great. Like, here's how checker solves for all that stuff. Now let's go through one other edge situation. What do you do if someone drops you into the wrong problem? This would happen to me when I was selling compensation software at Pave, where we were usually a solution that would help HR leaders run compensation reviews and all of that stuff. So, like, every six months, you'd run this, like, big performance review cycle where, like, every single employee gets, like, a performance review, and then you determine, like, the percent increases for every single employee. You give some promotions. You pull market data in, and it's, like, super super complex. But then every once in a while, like, a talent leader would come inbound or someone would, like, have an idea of how this could help their talent team, and they'd be like, yeah. Like, I really care about, like, compensation transparency with our candidates, which, like, sounds really nice. It was a problem that we could solve. We could, like, show candidates, like, what the market range was for, like, their job. It was, like, a 2 figure problem. Like, someone would pay $50 for it. And so what you do is you don't just, like, ignore that entirely. You pocket it and you pivot. So let's pretend that I ask my typically question, and they're like, yeah. You know, the this candidate experience over here is just, like, really no. Well, I can do one of two things. I can ask my magic moment question and be like, totally get it. Some of these background check things, they look, like, ridiculous, like you're about to get fished. Was there, like, a candidate that was at the finish line and you had to do this background check and, like, totally threw off the experience because they were like, what's going on? Is this a surreal company? Or is it just, like, something that was sort of annoying you the other day? I call that a push pull question where, like, I give them the right to say that it's, like, not a big problem. And if they're like, no, it's literally, like, blowing up candidate experiences over and over and over again, I'm like, great. Then I guess this actually is an executive problem. But I'll, like, almost give them the right to to tell me upfront that it's kind of an annoyance. And I'll be like, usually when people are using this background check software, these two things really suck. Oftentimes, you'll get things like when your background check process is, like, really slow and manual. Sometimes you literally have, like, a full time HR person who's checking background checks, or, like, your hires are being held up because of how slow the process is. I'm curious, like, to what extent do any of those resonate. So, like, to recap, if someone drops you in the wrong problem, you, like, follow them down that tree for a second because you don't wanna just, like, act like you're not listening to them at all. And you might find that it's actually an executive problem for them, but if it's not, pivot them into the winning zone problems. These two problems are the ones that we know are gonna win the deals for us over here. So you use the typically question to go from situation to problem here, and then you use the magic moment question to go from operational problem to executive problem. And the last question that I'll give you is one that I already alluded to, which is how do you quantify an executive problem? So the key to doing a good business case or selling a bigger deal later on is you wanna make sure that you have metrics behind this thing. K? So you need metrics or like numbers. So the key to getting to metrics here is the way you do that is you ask this push pull question, and so oftentimes impact questions can be like really, really awkward and uncomfortable because they sound like, what would you do with all that time back in your calendar? Or how much revenue could you make if you solve this problem? Or, how much revenue are you losing because of this problem? And they tend to feel like really leading, like you're pulling them into a sales trap. And so I like to release the tension of an impact question using what I call push pull. So let's go back to this part of the tree over here. K? Where on the left hand side, they're like at the end, they're like, okay. It's a little bit too slow, and let's pretend that we got them to say, like, oh, yeah. I literally have someone who's halftime dedicated to this or it's holding up hiring or something like that. Now what I need to do is I need to put numbers behind this. And so what I'm gonna do with a push pull is the push is I'm gonna make an assumption and throw a number out there, but then I'm gonna pull it away and give them the right to say it's not a problem. So it sounds like this. Hey. Like, I wanna make sure that I'm solving the right problem here. Knowing what I know about what it costs a people operations analyst to, like, be on background checks all the time, this alone probably, like, cost most teams. Like, if the people ops person is getting paid, like, 90 k a year, it probably cost most teams, like, 45 k plus all the operational headache and the cost of the background check itself. Is that directionally how I should think about what it means to solve this problem? Or is this pennies in the barrel, like, this person would have been doing this job anyways, and, like, there's not a big ROI on that person's time. I wanna make sure I'm solving the right problem. And so by, like, removing the pressure of the sale and saying, like, hey. Does this cost you, like, 45 k, or is it, like, peanuts? Oftentimes, that relieves enough pressure that they'll be like, yeah. No. It's it's, like, kind of around 45 k, so this is a problem. And so then I can add up this, and then I can add up, like, the potential risk from this. And then maybe I add up, like, some emotional problems from this. And, like, that is what will ultimately build my business case, which is a combination of emotional drivers and logical quantitative drivers. Alrighty, folks. So that's it for this discovery call. If this was helpful, I would love to understand what else related to discovery we cover. So put that down in the comments, or if there are other products that you'd like to see me do this for, let me know what you think of this bit. And by the way, this comes straight from our discovery course. This is literally, like, how I used to teach my sales teams to run discovery. I've coached over a dozen teams at this point in building their discovery playbooks using this framework, and it works everywhere. And so if you like this, I would really recommend you go check out our discovery course. It's like this on steroids with, like, 20 different questions you can use, all of the different, like, examples by industry plus every other part of discovery, whether it's the mini pitch, the agenda, the five minute drill that you run at the end, all that stuff. So because you're on YouTube, there's a special discount code in the link down below at the show notes. Go check it out, and and we'll, see you on the next one. Peace.
