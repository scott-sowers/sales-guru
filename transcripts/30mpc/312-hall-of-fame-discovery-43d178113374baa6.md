## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to a very special episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. I am your host for today, Nick Sigelski, and part of the reason today is so so special is that I am getting to interview my wonderful co host, Armand Farouk. Now it seems he's actually learned a thing or two about sales in the past 100 or so episodes we've done of thirty minutes to presidents club. And why you might wanna listen to this one is I think that a lot of salespeople obsess around discovery and uncovering pain and matching their solution to that and spin selling and gap selling and challenger selling even. And here's the thing. That stuff is all very, very important, but a lot of sellers stumble and fumble around managing the mechanics of navigating a deal. And so if you want to learn how to set not just next steps, but next next steps, if you want to figure out how to get on the same side of the table as your champion with prep calls and making sure that they're briefing their teammates, If you wanna figure out how to nail your next big group demo where you've got, like, eight different CXOs in the room, you may wanna give this one a listen. Three, two, one. Nick interviews, Armand. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, Armand. Welcome to the show. I hope you know that we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's hear your three. Alrighty, folks. Number one is called the five minute drill. At the end of every call, not just your discovery call, you're gonna end it with the five minute drill. Here's what it sounds like. You're gonna ask three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy this thing? Before you set a next step, you need to ask, based on what you saw, do you wanna move forward explicitly with our solution? Number two, when do you wanna buy this thing? If it were free, when would you actually make a decision? And then number three is how. And the key thing is you must tell them typically how someone would buy from this point on. You don't ask. You validate the how you buy. Beautiful. What's number two, Armand? Number two. This goes to the how piece, which is called next next steps. So once you get to that third question, do not just set a next step. Hey, let's do a sixty minute deep dive after this. You do not give away anything for free, and that includes demonstrations. And so if your next step is a sixty minute deep dive, the next next step is typically an executive level meeting that's about thirty minutes with a chief people officer or a chief finance officer or a CEO. Right? And so set a next next step, which sounds like, well, look. Typically, we would do a sixty minute meeting. If that goes well, you and I would walk through a proposal, and then we would run that by your chief people officer afterwards. Does that sound like a plan? And make sure that before you agree to the next step, there is agreement on the next next step. Very nice. Round us out, Armand. What's number three? Number three is let's say you got to that meeting with a CFO, for instance, and it gets into a negotiation tussle. What you have to do is you need to create a cost to negotiation. And what that means is if you have to give us a concession, we'll talk about what you do before you give a concession. But if you have to give a concession, never give anything away for free. So if someone wants a discount on future year pricing, an example of how you can create a cost to negotiation is you can make it a whack a mole game, where I can decrease future year pricing, but that means you're gonna pay more upfront. And what that does is it stops the bleeding in a negotiation, and it creates a cost where everything they ask for, they must now give something up. So, eventually, the battle stops. Well, very nice. So let's take us all the way to our very first meeting with a champion. Let's say you're meeting with someone who's, like, a a director level person. This person isn't gonna be able to get the deal done, but they do have enough political clout that they can help you get to getting a deal done. You've put on your very best shirt, Armand. You've done your research. You boot up the Zoom. You come in, and you let them enter from the waiting room. How are you kicking that meeting off? Great. First meeting. We have a director level person. I would consider this person to be at the line. K? So this is a good thing in my mind. Typically, you start with a little bit of rapport. I'm not the most talkative guy. I like to use targeted rapport. And what that means is I'm taking something relevant around their background. It might be a role change. It might be the fact that they're new at the company. It might be the fact that they've been there forever. And I'm using that to start to insert my point of view in the conversation. Oh, wow. This is the smallest company you've been at before. You must be doing a million different jobs, etcetera, etcetera. Once that rapport is done, usually two or three minutes, I tend to jump right into my agenda. I use the Doug Landis method of PPO, purpose, plan, outcome. And the key thing that I wanna do, folks, is a lot of people are over obsessed with discovery. Discovery is important. Don't get me wrong. Think of discovery as the ignition in your car. It allows you to drive forward. Your agenda and your last five minutes of the call are your steering wheel. That determines and makes sure that you're driving in the right direction in the first place. And so I'm gonna set the beginning, middle, and end direction of the call. And so, Nick, it might sound like this. Look, Jane, the reason that we're on this call is and really the purpose here is to figure out if we can help you at all. That's the purpose. K? The plan. The way we're gonna do that is before I just jump into the software, I sorta have to understand how you're doing x y z today to figure out exactly if we show you something, what we show you, and if there's even a problem to solve in the first place. Great. That's the plan. That's how we're gonna accomplish the purpose. The outcome. At the end of this call look. You you'll have a good sense if we can help you or not. And then, typically, what we would do is we would loop in your CFO, for instance, and we would do a deeper dive on the actual how we can solve the problem. In other words, it would typically be some sort of demonstration. Does that sound like a plan for us? So what I've done is I've told them a couple of things. Number one is I've told them, I'm gonna do discovery on you. Right? And the goal of this meeting is to figure out if you even have a problem that we can solve before I show you any sort of software so you don't start itching for me to show you a demo. And then what I've done is I've also planted the seed that I'm gonna ask you to multithread at the end of this call. And if you disagree with that, I'm gonna get to know about that right now, and we're not gonna waste our time upfront. Can we talk about that scenario, Armand? I mean, the first two are not tremendously, I don't know, contentious things. No one's gonna be like, oh, I don't want that to be the purpose of the call. And the plan that you laid out, you're like, hey. To get you the thing that you want, which is to see software, I kinda gotta figure out how you're doing things right now. So I don't think you're gonna get a lot of pushback or resistance on those. Where I see somebody getting tripped up is the person saying, hold on. Hold on. My CFO and slowing that down or resisting there. Can you talk about if there is resistance to the multithreading ask upfront, how you navigate that conversation? Yeah. And so I always like to ask often and early. Right? And the key thing is it's probably not gonna be a, yes, I would love to do that right this second. But what I've done is I've now planted the seed. And so let's say I get a bunch of resistance up there. I'll be like, look, totally fine. I completely get it. Oftentimes, what happens when buying a product like ours is people are really excited about it, and there's already some sort of budget for it. And so you wanna make sure that we get the right people involved early as possible. It sounds like this is gonna be a little bit more of a, hey. Let's make sure that you're super comfortable for with this thing and your team is super comfortable first, and then we can go take that step together afterwards after we've done a deep dive between you and I. Does that sound like a plan? We can talk about this later. I think we're laying the cart before the horse a little bit. And but I wanted to give you a sense of, like, what folks typically do. And so I'm not backing down to be clear. The only thing that I'm doing is I'm inserting a microstep in between that's saying, hey. I'm gonna get you and I on the same page first. Actually, I think you're right. But by the way, we're still gonna take that step together. And if you disagree with me, we can talk about that later. So what's really interesting about what you're doing here is you are setting the upfront five minute drill that you're doing, and then you're also having that conversation on the back half of the, meeting that you're in. I like the way you described it as the steering wheel. Right? And I agree with you. We're not gonna go tremendously deep into every little nuance of the questions that you ask and the order that you ask them in the discovery call. But one area that I've struggled as a seller before, Armand, is I recognize that that first meeting, there's really two big things you're covering. One is, can this thing help you, like, the the value sale of what you're selling? But then there's also having a conversation around the process of what this evaluation or buying cycle is going to look like. And you've gotta have a somewhat measured balance of the two of those. In that first call, I know you're not gonna get every little nuance of the pain and the impact and everything that you need from a discovery perspective to get the deal closed. Can you talk to me about, like, your philosophy on when do you stop doing discovery on the process and showing software and get into talking about the logistics of the deal? Right. So my perfect first thirty minute discovery call flows a little bit like this, is it's a five minute agenda plus rapport. It's about fifteen to twenty minutes of discovery. If it makes sense, there's a five minute demo, if it makes sense. And then there's about five minutes of next steps, a. K. A. The five minute drill at the end. Here's how I know I've done enough discovery. Or, in other words, the way you can invert it is here's what I must need to know to be true before I am allowed to show software. I must have a hypothesis that based on the information that I had today, if I took one or two more calls with this person, based on what they've told me, they would buy the software. And that might mean they've gushed their heart out on all of their pain points in the first ten minutes, and I don't need to do more. K? And so ask yourself before you go into the demo that question is, if this were to keep going in the same direction that it's going for two to three more calls, would they buy, knowing what I know today? Most of the time, the answer is no. K? So I know that's like a sense check question. Let's get a little bit more tactical on how you actually do that. K? I'm gonna use my company, Pave, as an example. One of our products is a total reward statement, And what that does is it allows people to understand not just what their salary is, but it's their equity, their salary, their benefits package, but then also model out the upside of their total comp package. K? And where a lot of people will stop is you typically ask the initial situational questions of what systems are you on? Those are qualification questions. And, how are you communicating equity today? And you get qual you get situational answers. And then oftentimes, you get a problem, which is my employees don't understand equity. And people get excited, and they start to start to share software at that point. That is not enough. What I need to understand is the so what behind your problem. In other words, is I need to get one big thing that hits the p and l of the business. And so what I need to get to is I need to get to my employees don't understand equity, And for that reason, it has come up in multiple exit interviews where employees are leaving due to compensation. In other words, you need to get one deep business impact and tell one story that shows people that you can solve their problem, and that's your cue when you are then allowed to show software. Okay. So let's drill into that question right there. You're on a discovery call with me, and I drop, you know what? My employees just don't understand equity. How do you get from I've made that statement to then me realizing or articulating I'm losing employees and I'm figuring that out in exit interviews? Here's how you don't do it. Nick, has that resulted in high attrition? Or, Nick, are employees leaving because of that? And you know why? Is that makes you get defensive. But that is, unfortunately, the question that I do have to ask. But here's how I can ask it in a way that sounds curious and interested from mister Muhlbauer. Is I'm gonna be like, Nick, we see this all the time. Usually, you don't, like, just wake up and think, you know, today, like, my employees really didn't understand equity. Could you give me a sense of, like, was there a moment that this came up? Did it come up in exit interviews? Did it come up in, you know, an NPS survey? Like, how did you actually, like, come to realize that employees didn't understand equity? K? So that's the first step is I need to get one data point, and it is nearly impossible, Nick, to answer that question without a specific story. K? Usually, what you'll give me at that point is you'll say, oh, yeah. I came up with one manager whose top performer was about to leave, or I came up in an exit interview here, or I just get peppered with a million questions. And don't stop there because now I have one deep data point. But, again, that is one data point. And so what do I need to do is I need to figure out if that's just one data point or if it's a million data points. And so the follow-up question to that is, shoot, Nick. I'm gonna tell a story. Empathize that I see this all the time. This happens a lot. I do a lot of massaging in my discovery so that you feel like I'm not just interrogating you. And I'm gonna be like, sometimes this is just a one off thing. Right? And it's not that, like, widespread of an issue. Was this an isolated case? Or what you were mentioning earlier is it sounds like this is coming up a lot. Is this, like is comp related attrition, like, a big percentage of the reason that people leave, or is this some something that's coming up left and right? Or was do you feel like this is just one of those one offs that can be handled individually with that manager? Nine times out of 10, if I've done the right discovery before, I figure out that comp related attrition is one of the biggest issues that they're losing people. Two things I wanna highlight that you are doing for the audience. One, your goal is to get them to tell you a story. And what you're doing is you're actually using a variant of what you and I call typically language, where you're saying, hey. Like, did this come up in an exit interview? Was there an employee NPS survey? You're actually prompting them with ideas that typically come up and that can help them make the connection to get you to the story. You're not just saying, when did you realize? I'm making them do all the work of thinking. The other thing that you're doing that's really powerful is you're also sense checking your deal with that second question when you ask about, is this an isolated incident? Because if it is, this is gonna come out in your deal, and you probably don't end up having a deal if this was just a one time thing that a director is looking to solve. This has to be almost a systemic business issue that you are helping to solve. Powerful stuff that you're doing. Let's sort of fast forward a bit, Armand. That meeting's gone well. You've had your next demo. You're starting to multi thread within the organization and you get to a common stage that a lot of sellers have, which is the big team demo. You've got six pages of notes. Your heart is thumping because you've got some CXOs in the room. Talk to me about what you do to make sure that you nail that big group demo. Alrighty, folks. So here are some critical assumptions that people make going into this big team demo that lead it to fail. The first critical assumption and probably the most terrible assumption to make is you assume that everyone knows what you do. I'm not saying is on board. Right? That's actually what most people do. Like, most people assume when you get onto the call, oh, these people are excited about my product, and they they've been brought up to speed by the champion. They we assume that they've been prepped by the champion. Nine times out of 10 folks, especially if it's a big room of five plus people, that usually means you're dealing with someone who hasn't really bought software before, and they've just thrown five people onto an invite, and maybe half of them have looked at your website. K? And so that is one key thing that you need to break down on the front end of the call. Number two is they assume that the big team demo is in fact a demonstration, which it is not. It is a validation of the key problems that you've learned in discovery, and it is rediscovery with executives on that call. K? And so on that basis, here is how you run that call. I'm gonna give you a four slide flow that I use for every single big team demo. There are four slides that I use every single time. The first is it's an introduction and agenda slide. K? And that introduction and agenda slide includes all the faces of all the attendees there. And the reason for that is I don't believe in doing one by one introductions. Instead, what I recommend is you introduce your side and your champion introduces their side. Because the moment you do the 10 person, hello. My name is Bill. I run the finance department for 10 people. No one wants to be on that call, and you've burned ten minutes. Okay? This is Nick. This is Jane. This is yada yada yada. That's my team. Who's your team? Great. The second thing is on that slide, have your champion introduce the call. Okay? Have them kick off the why we are here. Do not kick off the call yourself. You need to force them to set the stage on why you're here. That's your introduction. From there, the second slide is you're gonna recap the key business priorities and the business problems that they wanted to solve. And this is all before you talk about your product whatsoever. These should be able to stand alone. These are just the things you are trying to do without a product. If a product didn't exist, this is what you're hoping to accomplish. Then you have one slide on how you solve that problem, and then you have a fourth slide, which is all of those assumptions might be wrong. I'm curious. What do you actually care about as it pertains to compensation? So that's your four slide flow, and it gets them talking immediately, and it calibrates the room on key priorities. Are you preparing the champion in any way for the call? Like because you're sort of having an unconventional intro. You're asking them to do some specific things. What's the prep look like for that meeting with your champion? So this goes back to the five minute drill, which is at the end of the previous call, which is either a discovery that went really well or it's a sixty minute deep dive that leads into the, quote, unquote, big team or the exec team demo. Right? At the end of that call, I'm setting up what's called the champion sandwich. And so what that would sound like is, look, typically, Jane, you're the director of people ops. We're about to go into this meeting with your CPO. You and I would get on the same side of the table, And I wanna make sure that all the problems that you and I have discussed solving here, I wanna make sure that we knock it out of the park for that room. And the reality is, well, you've given me some really good stuff. There are gonna be some new faces in the room, and I wanna make sure that we make you look really good here. Would you be against doing a prep call for that meeting right beforehand? And then maybe we can just preschedule a debrief after the call so I can get your feedback. They'll never say no to it. This is also the best time to get digits, cell phone number. Be like, awesome. Sometimes it's helpful to call you right before the meeting. Could I shoot you a text too just so we can get out an email? Every single time, you'll get it if you have good rapport. You do that prep call. There are a couple things that I always need to know in that prep call. The first thing I need to know is who is on the call. Obviously, specifically, I need to know their titles. And then the second thing that I probably the most important thing to know is I need to know what do they want to get out of the call, Right? What do they care about? And I'm basically doing discovery secondhand through my champion. Like, what does the CFO care about? What's an example of a software that they've blocked in the past? What was an example of a of a tool that they were super excited about in the past? When AEs run demos for them in the past, I'm curious, do they tend to be the type of person who gets really annoyed if they get asked a million questions, or do they tend to want to jump in with a million questions? I want to know everything humanly possible around how that person desires to receive discovery. Right? And then the third piece, which answers your final question, Nick, which is, have you gone and explained why we are here today to them? And if the answer is no to that, I always say, hey, I'm going to give you the slide that we're going to use on the front end of the key priorities that you wanted to solve for and the key ways that we can solve your problem. Would you mind pre walking them through this just so you can calibrate upfront and we're not starting from zero? Because I would hate to jump onto that call, and they jump on and they're like, hey. I don't even know what you do. Can you help bring us to stage three and catch them up to where you and I are in the sales cycle? I've got one more question for you around multithreading and the five minute drill. Because I understand the five minute drill with your champion where it's like, at the end, you're figuring out, alright, where do we go from here? Are you happy with this, etcetera? I feel like if I've got now meeting with one group, demo with another group, I'm having conversation with my champion, am I doing the five minute drill when I have the permissions and integrations meeting with the analyst's analyst? You do the five minute drill at the end of every single call. K? And so let's talk about what the five minute drill would look like at the end of a big team demo. This is probably the toughest five minute drill in the entire call, and the reason it's tough is because you usually have five plus people on the call. And what it would sound like is, look. Nick, Jane, Sean, this is the first time that you guys are seeing everything Pave has to offer. But what we've done is we've recapped all the conversations we've had with your director of people, Diane, here and given you a sense of, like, where Pave fits in as it pertains to some of your key business priorities. And you've also gotten to see how we can solve your problem. And usually, at this point, what you'd have a sense of is, is pay the right solution to be able to, like, help you solve some of these problems? And so before we talk about next steps, before we talk about cost and pricing and all this stuff, like, can I just get an independent opinion from you all and get a sense of like, how do you feel about what we showed you today? That's if it's a room of like three or four people. If it's a room of five plus, I need to ask that question specifically to the key executive buyers in the room. And so if it's a room of five plus people, I'm gonna identify the two or three that really matter in the room beforehand with my champion, but then also just what I know about who makes decisions. Right? And I'm going to target that question specifically at the economic buyers. K? And then I still go into the when and the how. Right? I inform them of the timeline that we've already agreed upon with our champion. And I say, are there any blockers to that? I wanna get the blockers out upfront. And then I explain the how, which would oftentimes be in getting executive sign off to engage in a procurement process offline with the champion. I'm not making them do all of that, but I'm getting them to sign off on the process of what I'm gonna do with their team afterwards. Armond, this has been a fun interview. I never get to interview you. We're running out of time. We gotta move to the final question. The final question is this. We've talked about a lot of shoulds, things salespeople should be doing. I'm gonna ask you about a shouldn't. So the last question is this. What is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that they need to break, shatter, and quit because it's hurting them more than it helps. They mistake selling activities as revenue generating activities. K? And what that looks like is they give things away for free. They give the demo away for free. They give a proposal away for free. They give everything. They give multiyear deals away for free. They keep giving things, and the reason for that is they justify it because it's like, oh, I had 10 customer calls this week. And to me, if you've jumped on to a second call or a third call or a fourth call with the buyer and they haven't explicitly told you that you are the vendor of choice or that we believe that you can solve problems for this, that they have not yet earned the demo with you. That is the key mistake that people make is they think that having more calls is better, and I believe having more of the right calls is better. And you should do as much as humanly possible to make your customers do an equal amount of work as you, if not more work in the sales process, to opt back in to buying your tool. And if they don't, you know where you stand in your sales cycle, and you should go focus your time elsewhere on other deals. Beautiful. Arman, thank you so much for joining us, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Your top four actionable takeaways from this wonderful episode with Arman Farrokh. One, never walk into a big group demo without having a prep call with your champion to cover who's gonna be in the room, what do they want to get out of this meeting, How have past demos gone well or gone awry? And do they have context? Because if they don't have context, your champion better give them context. Two, make sure you connect the thing that you sell to something that actually hits the p and l. It's not enough to hear from your champion, well, my employees don't understand equity. You need them to connect that problem, not understanding equity, to a real business outcome or failing, I suppose. Number three, you can connect the thing that you sell to a real business outcome by getting the customer to tell you a story of how this impacted them. You might say something like, well, gosh. I can't imagine you woke up yesterday and said, I need to request a demo with Nick because this is a problem. I guess, could you tell me about the moment when you realized this was something that you needed to address? Number four, ensure the problem that you are solving is not just a one off isolated incident. You've got to ask, is this something that's happening frequently, or is this just a one off thing that could get handled on its own? If it's a one off, you probably don't have a deal. So this is the part of the show where Arman would say, oh, Nick, how can people help us out? And I would answer that by saying, oh, follow us on LinkedIn or subscribe to the show. But unfortunately, Armond has left the studio, and so no one is here to ask me how people can help us out. So instead, I'm just gonna say some nice things about Armond because for those of you who don't know, he puts in a ton of work to make thirty minutes to presidents club happen. The guy is literally a VP of sales, and he's in back to backs all day. So he puts in a ton of work early mornings and nights and weekends. He and I do a lot of planning for thirty minutes to presidents club on Saturday mornings, and I wanna say thank you to my wonderful cohost for all of the hard work that he puts in to make thirty minutes to president's club possible. And if you would be open to sending Armond a nice message on LinkedIn that said, Nick told me to say that I kind of like thirty minutes to presidents club and you're not such a bad host. I bet that would make his afternoon and make him smile. And I do wanna make Armond smile despite all of the, the jokes that I make about him. So an ode to Armond. There it is. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes to Presidents Club.
