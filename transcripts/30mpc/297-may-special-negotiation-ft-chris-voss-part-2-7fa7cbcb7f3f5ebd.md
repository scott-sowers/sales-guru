## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. I'm your host, Nick Sigelski, joined with my cohost, Arman Farouk, and we have part two with Chris Voss. Arman, I'm not gonna let you label me again this week. This was a great episode, but I would like you to please share with the audience. I don't know what you're doing. Share with the audience why should people listen. Seems like you're excited for a second round of the show, Nick. Well, folks, if you liked what you got last week, we talked about the first half of a negotiation. We talked about when they balk at price, how do you get them talking about where they're coming from? How do you figure out if they're just a bargainer or if there's actually a fit issue? And once you figure those things out, that brings us today. Today, we're talking about how do you start to drive toward a solution in a negotiation. And once you start to do that, what are some keys to using silences, pauses, inflections versus ending on a down tone to nail the tone in a negotiation. It is part two in a negotiation master class in a three, two, one. Let's roll. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Chris, we've talked a lot about labeling the emotion if someone's blocking that price. You try to unpack where they're coming from, and, eventually, you need to start working towards some sort of solution. And you mentioned a really interesting concept earlier here and on another interview that I saw you on where you say they should feel like they earned everything they got. And I know if someone asks for a 5% discount, I even if I know I can give them a 5% discount, what I should not do is say, sure. Let's end the deal. Because they're gonna be wondering, could I have gotten 10? Could I have gotten 15? Could I have gotten 20? So can you talk about how you move from the labeling portion, the early part of negotiation, to the later part of a negotiation where you start to align on a solution and make them feel like they won. Yeah. That you know, in our human nature, you're peril. And that's just an unavoidable thing. If you get what you ask for too easily, you're gonna be disappointed. And your disappointment is gonna manifest itself in the implementation. And I kinda need to say both of this front then. And I've been I've been a pastor, made the mistake to give in too quickly, and it always regret. So I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna figure out a little bit, on a 5% if this is doable, if this is really the issue. I might say it seems like 5% of Memphis is a great deal for you. You know, I'm probably I'm gonna wanna hit you with a couple labels. I'm gonna I'm gonna get you forgive me an affirmation on that. Without trying to get you to say yes, I'm gonna hit I'm doing it with labels because it hits the brain different. But I'm I'm gonna get you to affirm that for me with tax rights or expansions on it based on my label probably three times. Jim Kent in his bookstore with no, add an approach, or food plus to get somebody to say yes to the same question three times. Now that is not the yes momentum, which is three different yeses, which leads somebody down the path. This was three yeses to the exact same question. Three times to get your commitment. He felt you had to get somebody to commit to a firm three times on the same issue. You read their body language. You read their tone of voice. You you you wanna take somebody from if you if you're going for yes, which I don't, but it would be taking somebody from yeah to yeah to yes. You're gonna get the delivery, the the tonality, three straight times. Even if somebody's BS ing, the more times they repeat it, the more emotionally committed they are. So you're looking for an affirmation on an issue three times via labels, via paraphrase, via mirror, via summary, Anything other than a yes oriented question. I'm not gonna say, so 5% would make this a great deal for me. I'm driving for a yes with that. Seems like 5% could make this a great deal for me. That subtle change in voltage is your emotional system completely different. I am not going for yes no matter what because it always the ministers report. So, Chris, I do one, two, three additional labels. And then what they say is you're trying to get me to essentially land at the 5%, and I'm not willing to land there. And the reason that I'm not willing to land there is because I gotta go talk to my boss, or I start to say, my CFO controls the decisions, or I make it seem like I have zero power in this negotiation whatsoever. And you talk about in your book, the more they talk about the other guy, the more they probably know what they can get or the more they probably control the power. And that's oftentimes true in sales is our buyers are primed with the price that they need to get or what gets them a yes in a negotiation. So when someone starts talking about their manager or their CFO making all the decisions for them, what do I do from there? And I'm just gonna I'm I'm I'm gonna let you I'm gonna let you roll with it. I'm I'm never gonna want you because you it also may be the strength of your pitch, once you know that you're gonna carry the day with your manager that you see it go based on how you pitch. And you know that you gotta work hard for this, and, you know, you gotta put in the time. Then you probably if if you're actually making a deal and you're not playing me for the rabbit, you know, I'm not a competing fit, then I'm I'm not gonna pressure you for it. So we we need to let the clock tick a little bit. Cool. If I don't do you know, you need to put in another day. It's not close enough to the end of the week, to the month, to the quarter, depending upon how you are being judged internally. Like, alright. I don't know. Do you wanna burn up some more time to actually make a deal? And I'm looking for a long term relationship. Will you trust me? Will you feel like I'm looking at for your interest? What more time do you got? I you know, your your reaction could be a variety of things. If you wanna continue a conversation in the moment, you're testing it. I might say, you know, how has your CFO reacted in the past? How's your CFO shot you down? How's this impact with the rest of you too? If you answer that with real clear answers, you're telling me the truth. If you're at a loss for words, you're bullshit. Because if it's really there and I ask you how, it's gonna be in your head. But if you're using as simply as a tactic, it's not in your head. Vision drives decision. You're looking at an outcome. You're looking at implementation. You know what it is before we start. So if I ask you our how or what question, that's really designed to get a vision implementation response out of you and you go dead silent, I know you bullshit. Now I'm not gonna call you out. I'm just gonna be happy to be that much smarter and more. One of the things you talked about earlier was giving the buyer the the no slowly so that they're not surprised. And if I think about some of the deals that I've sold and the negotiations I've been through, my buyers typically don't grant me the same courtesy. And a lot of times, I get smacked out of the blue with a a firm no or a a last minute ask for a concession, or I feel like I have the deal done. They've been giving signals, and they almost, like, switch into this negotiation mode. And one of the things I've struggled with that I really admire about you, you always seem very calm and present and centered. And one of the things I've experienced in a negotiation is my emotions go awry. And I'm wondering if you have any best practices that you follow or any things that you do to keep yourself in that really calm level focused space, especially in a tight negotiation. Well, if you've gone through it enough times in the past, just go back in your head and reedit the mental thing. I mean, you it'd be you on Stevensville, you know, your own writer director. Right? So you shot it once real time in reality. You got that memory in your head, and you run it again, and you run it the same way. What that is is a rehearsal to do it again wrong. Now you can go back in and override the video in your head. You can go back in and imagine something cool and calm. And this is actually a characteristic of all of the great world champion athletes. They're running the video in their head over and over again. I heard it once referred to as visioning, and they're imagining the game winning shot. They're imagining the game winning hot or the the some 300 yards wide. When they were at it's that hole that they hit it into the water last time. They were there if you want the golf analogy. They go in, and when they're getting ready to set up and hit it in real life again, if they're replaying the video of them hitting it in the water in their head before they hit the ball, it's probably going in the water. But if they're replaying a vision in their head of it hitting the green, it increases the chance that it's hitting the green. So you can go back in those moments where you wish you would have performed better and reedit the video in your head and imagine yourself calmly reacting. Imagine hearing yourself saying things with a calm tone. The the interesting thing the neuroscientists have picked up for us, the voice in our head activates many of the same neural mechanisms of actually speaking. If you imagine yourself singing it properly, it's pretty close to actually practicing singing it properly. So you could do it in a on an airplane where you can't be doing the out loud rehearsals. But if you're running it in your head, you're activating the same neurons, and it's almost as good. On the note of tone pauses being calm in conversation, You talked about this funny concept in another interview called Elon Musk silence, which is you gotta be so comfortable after a label just letting it sit. Right. Can you talk about some of the most important places in a negotiation where you should be leveraging silence and zip in the lips, going on mute, making sure that no words come out of your mouth. Is there any time that you've said something you really want it to land? You know, it's a label. It's a question. Whatever it might be. That you know, start counting thousand citizens. And two out of three of us had a little problem with that. I think you probably heard me talk about the world divides even the third, assertiveness, and The assertives and the economies struggle even their mouth shut. They're vastly different reasons. And I'm I'm doing an interview recently, Camille Vasquez and Johnny Deporton, Got her as a guest on, the thing we do on Fireside, which is an interactive social media app, live interactive. It's concrete. And I just wasn't waiting long. And I'd I'd ask Camille a question, or I'd say something to her to get a response, and she'd be contemplating it. And, you know, I wasn't keeping my mouth shut long. And I I'd wait for about the count of two, and if she didn't answer, I'd start talking again. We both started talking at the same time. Like, ah, I just I gotta keep my mouth shut. I'm just I'm not waiting long for her to respond. So it it's a struggle. Now the one person that loves silence and and loves keeping her mouth shut is the end. And the the the Elon Musk, thing that I referred to is getting interviewed by Lex Fridman. Lex is an. And on another show, Lex is talking about silence. Like, she feels intimacy. Like, if you can share sit there in silence with Lex, he's talking about he feels connected to you. He feels silence is a shared intimacy, and that is vastly different than the way the the assertors and the accommodators. And stuff. And it listening to Lex talk about that, it never occurred to me that you feel a shared bonding moment if I could keep my mouth shut. So anytime you want something to land, give give it time. Let let it let it sink in. Don't don't don't panic. I've always. One thing that I've noticed you do, especially when you are using the tool that you have of of your different tonality, is you do different things with your body language. Like, when you asked the question earlier where you had that uptone right at the very end where you asked a question, you sort of cocked your head to the side and your eyebrow sort of raised. And I'm wondering if you can talk about some of the specific things you do with body language, maybe actually starting with this piece of silence, like, when you're being exactly quiet. I get you're counting the thousands in your head. Like, what do you do? Like, look down? Do you pretend to take notes? Do you drink water? Like, how do you hold that silence? And then what are some other body body language best practices you have? Yeah. It's a great question on silence. I'd have to think about that for a little while. I mean, maybe it's just physically being still because, you know, your body language can help manifest your turnout. And with practice, you kinda get that. And so if you if you wanna be in silence, my first guess is probably just remain as still as you possibly can. Now, inflection. Particularly, you you wanna download inflect, all you gotta do is not be changed. We get that question a lot with women or people who have higher voices. Like, you know, I don't have I don't have the late night FM DJ voice. You know? I don't I don't have the deep bass voice. You know? I don't have your voice. I don't have Andrew Huellner's voice. I don't have The Rock's voice. You know what I mean? These guys with these deep voices? That's not the same as a downward inflection, and you can you can override your tongue by just dropping your chin. And then the the inquisitive tone? Yeah. I'm definitely I'm definitely raising my chin and cocking my head simultaneously to enhance the delivery. And you so you can whoever you are, you can figure out what works best for you with practice and observation. But broad general terms, it has a lot to do with what you do with your chin as you're talking. And, you know, that was a that was a great catch on your part. I hadn't noticed that that was, like, cocked my head when I did the, upward inflection. I definitely do that to enhance the delivery. Chris, can you talk about this late night DJ FM voice? I've heard you talk about it in the context of using it to draw lines in a negotiation where it's too far, and you have to make it clear that it can't go past here. When and how do you use that voice? Probably about maybe 20% of the time. Real rough ballpark guess. Draw the lines or make another person feel that you're a thousand percent solid. There's no movement. Now you're not trying to corner anyone. So I need you I need you to feel that I really, really mean this without me being a threat. And most of the time, the late night FM DJ will sit down and reflect them and then go on bedside, not threatening, not condescending. There's slight tonality changes that cause those things. Not accusatory. Just, you know what, this is the way it which is, I'm good with you. Leave it. But it's a way to express take it or leave it without making somebody feel porn. But that, you know, my intent when I do that is also that if this doesn't work for you, no hard for you. But this is what I need for this to be a great deal for them. I wanna wanna continue. So, yeah, probably maybe 20% of the time, maybe even less. But it's gotta be in your arsenal because you need to let people know where you're from without making them feel that change, without making them feel cornered, without making them feel it's an ultimate takeaway. It probably isn't take a look. But if you if it feels like an ultimatum and you're the type that gets triggered challenged easily, that's that's not in either of our interests for me to challenge in in in that If I'm someone who's newer to using this late night DJ voice, what are some of the cues or things that I should be intentionally doing to be able to get it from myself? Like, how do I actually do it when you're teaching it to someone? Yeah. Maybe take a deep breath in advance, you know, or, you know, a slight hesitation. Sort of gather yourself up, so that you feel solid. You you know, intention has a smile. Your inner voice betrays your outer voice. Let yourself feel solid. It's gotta be genuine that you are solid in your phone. It's not a tactic. You know? If it's if it's disingenuous, it's gonna come out in the long run, and you're gonna, condition people that you can't be trusting. You gotta really you gotta really mean your walkaways, and it may be part of a walkaway. It may be part of an immovable point. If I got an immovable point or an immovable problem, I'm gonna want you to volunteer to solve it. I'm not gonna ask you to solve it. I'm gonna want you to volunteer to solve it, and I'm gonna want you to have the freedom to solve it or not, which increases the chances that you're gonna volunteer to do it because it's an. So calibrated, in that context, I guess, is what I'm driving. If I can give the audience a one, two punch using two of the concepts from this interview that have worked really well for me is it's on the walkaway, where a lot of times, a tough procurement person or a tough CFO, they'll be pushing you into the corner on the $50,000 discount. And oftentimes, the first thing that I'll hit them with is the late night DJ FM voice, Or I'll say, I'm sorry. I just know we can't do a five a 50 k discount. And you start there, and you let the silence sit. And then you transition to a label where you might say seems like or sounds like it's not even worth me going back and talking to the team around what we could do moving forward. And so you call the bluff on the walkway, and you basically say, I guess it doesn't even make sense for me to come back with a solution at all. And when you do that, you draw the line, and you put the ball in their court to do the final walkway. Because oftentimes, the buyer has no risk with doing the first walk away, but you make it clear that if they walk away, the interaction is actually finished. Yeah. I like that a lot. In a lot of other ways, I always want you to have a decision to walk away, and and we need it. So I I I like where that shifts the burden of the decision making versus this is over or moving forward. And I like to shift in the burden on of the problem onto the person that's causing the problem. That's you're gonna cause it. I'm gonna shift the burden to solution over. Chris, thank you for joining us. We are unfortunately running out of time and so we have to move to our final question. And our final question is this: we've talked about a lot of really great things that salespeople should be doing when it comes to negotiation, But now I gotta flip that question on its head and ask you about a shouldn't. And so my last question for you is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Yeah. I think driving for yes is probably the worst habit after. I mean, if you if you can go from yes to no to start with, there's pretty much an instantaneous 23% improvement in your effectiveness, which to me is both delightful and a caution. I see a lot of salespeople that it's a simple but difficult switch, and the acceleration in their effectiveness is so instantaneous that they don't learn anything else, which is a shame because they just turned themselves from a c student into a b student, which is a great improvement. And, like, this is awesome. Yeah. But you're not an a student yet. And people don't know how much better they could get to shift the rest of the way. But the yes is the biggest problem out there. The yes addiction, you get happy years. You get bamboozled. As soon as the other side finds out that all they gotta do is feed you a bunch of yeses and you got happy years, and you start engaging a free consultant, and they no longer need you. You're giving away your value. They no longer need you. You're just killing yourself by being a yes app. Chris, thank you for joining us. How can people follow-up with you? Yeah. The best way is to subscribe to our newsletter. It's complimentary. That's not why it's valuable. It's valuable because it's actionable actionable and concise. I gotta tell you something. I value concise, actionable stuff. The website is blackswanltd.com, blackswanltd.com. Soon as you go there, you're gonna get the opportunity to sign up for the newsletter. Give us your email. You get the newsletter Tuesday morning. You're gonna find out about different ways to learn from us. It's really the gateway to the gold mine. So subscribing to our newsletter, The Edge, is the best way to follow-up things. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Your top four actionable takeaways from this part two with Chris Voss. Number one, you, when responding to another party's asks in a negotiation, should not go off on your own and then come back with a full built out response to the prospects, demands, asks, requests, etcetera. And the reason for that is if you are not cocreating the solution to a commercial agreement, there are two problems. Problem number one is you are creating a response with imperfect information, which you are never going to have perfect information, but you're gonna come back and you're gonna slightly miss. And that's a problem that gets expanded or made worse because the other problem with coming back with a full, here's what we're gonna do, is that the other party feels like you painted them into a corner, that their voice wasn't part of the solutioning, and they are going to feel diminished, which will make them push back. So don't do that. Number two. If your prospect is doing something that you actually like, maybe they're working really hard at wrangling stakeholders or they've been really communicative recently or they responded to a negotiation or an offer of yours in a moderately generous way, label the good thing that they are doing. That will give them affirmation that the behavior they're doing right now is good and make them do more of that good thing. It is small, but it is powerful for getting an intended behavior out of your prospect. Number three. If you get the sense that you're aligning on a solution, don't just say, yep. I can do that deal and run away because they're going to think that they could have gotten more out of you. Hit them with another label. You might say, sounds like 5% would be a good deal for you, and you wanna use an uptone inflection on that one. And then lastly, number four, use the late night DJ FM voice to draw lines. One of the best ways you can do that is if there's a walkaway line, and you could say, look. There's just no way that I can give you a 50 k discount. Alrighty, Nick. That is the end of an amazing two part special. Can you tell folks what they can do to help us out here? Well, Arman, I do happen to have something in mind. One of the things we talked about in this episode was how Chris uses body language in a negotiation and how he uses his body language to get a certain tone out of himself using his chin position. And it's one thing to hear it on a podcast. It's another to see how he actually does it. And if you're someone who likes seeing us, I don't know why anyone would wanna look at our ugly mugs, Arman. But if you're actually interested in seeing the guests, we are starting to put thirty minutes of presidents club episodes on YouTube. And so this episode is on YouTube. There is a link in the show notes if you wanna see see this episode. Go check it out. I promise Arman and I will try to look more presentable, but Chris looks great, and he really has some effective stuff that I recommend you watch. Thanks for watching or listening, and we'll see you next week on thirty minutes to Presidents Club.
