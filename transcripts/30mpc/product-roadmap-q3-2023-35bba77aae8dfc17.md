## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this road map episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we got some crazy products coming your way. You thought we were gonna be sandbagging because Nick went full time and then I went full time. You think you just leave this place with only a podcast? You think you'd leave with only a webinar? You think you'd leave with just a newsletter? We got a lot more coming your way than that, folks. So, Nick, why should people listen? Indeed. That is true, Arman. And so for our first announcement, we're changing thirty minutes to president's club to thirty seconds to president's club because truth be told, your attention span just keeps shrinking and shrinking and shrinking. For our second announcement, if you've ever wanted to see Nick and Armand in Hollywood in front of the camera, well, nobody really wants that. But if you've wanted some Netflix style stuff from thirty minutes to president's club, you may like announcement number two. And then couple quarters ago, Armand, we said, hey. We ain't doing webinars anymore. Nobody wants to join a webinar. Sadly, our tactic tear downs are following the same fate, but we have a replacement in store for announcement number three. And so look at that, folks. What could Nick possibly be talking about? Well, we're gonna cover the things we cover on every road map episode, which is number one, feature enhancements on our product, things that are changes but are not revolutionary that you should keep an eye out for. Number two, we will walk through some new product launches, and we got some big ones. Number three, every single quarter, we announce a new member of the club at thirty minutes to president's club, and we are announcing a new club member at the end. And lastly, number four, that club member will run a home run lap, and we will give you the quarterly content lineup, which includes everything from tactic tear downs, which no longer exist apparently, amongst other things that we're doing this quarter that you can sign up and attend today. And if you wanna make sure you never miss these updates, at the very top of the show notes, there is a link for you to follow where we're gonna send out all of this stuff in writing so you can make sure you never miss any of this. If you're on our mailing list, you're gonna get that stuff too. Okay. Section one, feature enhancements. We got one pretty meaty feature enhancement. Historically, Nick and I are social media Luddites. We have no idea how to even open Instagram. Don't even try to find us on Instagram because you'll see three followers. It's extremely unimpressive. And so what we do is we just post on LinkedIn because that is all we've known. And the problem is things get lost on LinkedIn, and the other problem is a thirty minute podcast is phenomenal. But what if you only have time for a thirty second daily dose of tactics? And look at that. We have now given birth that sounds sort of weird, but we've given birth to the daily sales tactic on Twitter. One sales tactic broken down step by step every single day that'll get you that much closer to Presidents' Club. It's like having a calendar on your desktop where every day you rip off the page, and it's one more tactic you get every single day. And you should be able to digest that thing in thirty seconds and use it right then and there so you can get your daily dose of daily tactics from thirty minutes to president's club. And, Arman, you weren't kidding about that Luddite thing if you're indeed still using a paper calendar, which worries me a little bit. But, folks, if you wanna follow us on Twitter, again, that first link in the show notes, go follow that. We will send you a link to our wonderful Twitter page, which is exciting. But the bigger stuff are on are some of our new product launches. And one of the toughest things about running thirty minutes to president's club is it can sometimes be like trying to find a tactic in a haystack because we do these big thirty minute episodes, and we've got these big thirty minute tactic tear downs. But if you just wanna figure out the thirty MPC best practice on how to use the word why strategically in sales or, hey, the five minutes on how to set an agenda, it's sort of janky. I gotta scroll through our feed. You might have to follow Armond on LinkedIn, which is an experience in itself. And, Armond, we for a while talked about going to Hollywood. Going to Hollywood, getting in front of the camera, and that is here with the launch of thirty minutes to president's club YouTube. For the longest time, I've been told that I have an amazing face for radio, and so we've withheld YouTube for a period of time. However, we found that to Nick's point, there's a massive issue that can be resolved with short form video content. The first piece is, believe it or not, people will still ask us, have you done anything on cold call openers before? Which is shocking to me because we've done probably 20 episodes on cold call openers. And so instead of sifting through the podcast feed for the cold calling playbook, which there are two editions of, which you should go find right now, also available in the show notes, instead of having to do that, you should be able to type in cold call opener on the 30 YouTube channel, and three cold call openers pop up, and each video is five minutes. And you can get exactly what you need right now. Then, number two, when you open up that video, sometimes we've been told when I'm driving, I almost wanna pull over and write notes when I'm listening to your podcast because I'm gonna forget these things. And the problem with that is that podcasts are only auditory, and we're talking about pretty dense stuff. And so when you watch that cold call opener video, one of the things that you will see is a visual breakdown of that cold call where we are walking through the steps, and you can see that live. Or you might even see a live role play that is subtitled prospect and myself talking to each other, which are, again, things that you cannot do in audio only format. And then the last thing is it's the difference between a Hollywood set and live improv. Of course, we can do some of this stuff on tactic teardowns. However, there's something to be said around being able to publish an extremely tight visual tactical breakdown to you all so you don't have to sit and wait thirty, sixty minutes to get that information that you need. So starting on July 10, every single day, mark your calendars. We are going to be dropping a video on the YouTube feed. And if you're on our mailing list, you're gonna get a big reminder email the day that everything goes live. If you are not and wanna make sure you are there for the launch of 30 MPC YouTube, open your phone right now. Go to the show notes of this episode, and you will see that very first link. If you go through it, we will make sure that the day YouTube goes live, you're there. You're watching us. And, Armand, I think your face isn't that bad. I think the audience will be able to get over that because of the wonderful sales best practices that you will share. You know what? Folks are gonna learn to live with it just like I have. But there's something that we can't live with any longer, Armand. Last year, we said goodbye to webinars because most webinars suck. It's a bunch of guests who show up on a panel and they're they're just talking, and it's not worth anybody's time. If you're gonna do a webinar that could have been a podcast, just make it a dang podcast. So we abandoned doing webinars in favor of tactic tear downs, live tactic tear downs, where we were only covering content that was improved by the visual nature of the webinar platform. But we've realized something, Armand. We have got to make some changes to tactic tear downs. So as Nick mentioned, no one wants to watch your webinar. Webinars sound boring, corporate, dry, and then breaking down prospecting emails on a webinar sounds like a great way for me to replace melatonin for those. Instead, I remember when I was learning best as both a sales rep and as a sales leader is I would get the two or three best reps on the floor, and I would put them on the stage. I'd be like, alrighty, folks. You're taking turns handling objections. Or, hey. You're gonna break down this discovery call step by step, or, hey. We said this. What should we have said instead? And instead of a boring webinar, now what you will see is what's called tactic TV. Yes. No more tactic teardowns. No webinars. Tactic TV. Every single show we host is going to be a live sixty minute game show style sales competition, where instead of having someone boring walk through a long objection handling framework, we're gonna be having three or four people going head to head playing wheel of objections. Instead of reading a boring LinkedIn post about writing emails with AI, you'll watch three sellers compete against the machine in beat chat GPT. And, of course, instead of watching a boring lunch and learn where you review someone's tape at the speed of molasses, we're gonna rattle off the things that were said that were wrong, and then we're gonna correct them in the greatest show of them all, what should you have said instead? And so every single show, you'll watch multiple sellers compete on a blast of a stage while, of course, breaking down the best tactics you've ever seen in your life. And the best part is you don't have to wait that long because our very first tactic TV goes live in July. So in lieu of a webinar in July, we've got tactic TV. V. And you can go to the link in the show notes and see all of our past and present and upcoming tactic TV shows on the 30 to presidents club website. And in this episode, we will be letting you know who those TV guests are at the end of the show. But we've got something bigger here, Armand. It is the launch, the release, the announcement of our newest club member. And this is somebody who I hear people talking about in sales, oh, you gotta have empathy. And for a long time, Arman, we were like, yeah. We know. That's just like one of those fluffy things that people say that you can't actually use in sales. But this is somebody who has taught us the most practical, tactical, actionable, usable ways to take what is this other person's experience and use it to be an effective seller. This person's got stuff like the priority drop. He's got killer stuff for responding to objections, and I'm gonna let you, Arman, because I'm an empathetic person, reveal who it is. It's the one and only, SpongeBob. You guys know that Krabby Patty moment? Here's the reveal. It's the one and only mister Jason Bey, who I was lucky enough to have lunch with the other day. And holy smokes, did you ever think that you could have sushi and sales tactics in a more joyful combination with this lad? The thing that I appreciate most about Jason Bae is some people are talented, other people are thinkers, but Jason Bey is both. What Jason Bey has the ability to do is he has the ability to spot patterns in what amazing sellers do, whether it's the permission based opener, whether it's a discovery framework. And he has this insane ability to break all of those things down in not scripts, but in frameworks that allow you as a seller to take the bits and pieces and put them together in the style that works best for you. The way he breaks down his cold call opener is in three steps. The way he breaks down the priority drop is in three steps. The way he's going to break down some things in his club playbook are all broken down into repeatable patterns that you can take the ingredients of, but then you can decide which cookie flavor you're gonna make today. And so on that note, I believe it is time to go through our final section of the road map, which is the content road map. Nick, would you like to lead us off? No. Because the outline says that you were gonna lead us off, but I'm happy to take that off of your plate, Arman. So the month of July is gonna be Jason Bey's home run lap. It's gonna start with his club playbook episode, which is where he's going to give a ten minute summary of how you can get to power in your deals every single time. He's gonna follow that up by hosting our Tactic TV show, and that's gonna be starring Jason, Jen Allen, and Kyle Ese, where we're actually gonna be taking a real sales call. And there's times that the rep didn't do so hot on that call. And Jason and Jen and Kyle are gonna be chiming in on what they should have said instead. Finally, Jason is gonna be releasing a get to power playbook in our tactic toolkit. So Jason is really gonna help you if you're trying to get to above the line stakeholders. July is gonna be your month with our man, Jason Bay. And if you want to fight the robot, welcome to AI August because August is the second month of the summer, and there's been all this crazy nonsense around how AI is gonna take over the sales world. And we don't really have a desire to be like the fearmongers that are on LinkedIn. Instead, what we'd like to do is we'd like to help you be part of the solution and learn how to use this stuff to sell better. And so AI August leads off with Charlie Johnson starting off with a ten minute club playbook on how to use chat GPT to write cold emails. Next up, we have our tactic TV show, which is beat ChatGPT, where Alan Shen is gonna be manning ChatGPT, and then Charlie Johnson, Vin Matano, and Anthony Natoli are going to be writing emails in parallel to try to beat ChatGPT. And then lastly, while Alan's gotten really, really good at writing these queries to ChatGPT, you will also have a toolkit from him on Alan Shen's ChatGPT sales queries. And so September, it's an exciting one because both you and I, Armand, have our birthdays in September. And to celebrate, you're putting more work on my to do list. I get to do our club playbook episode, which is gonna be a guide to doing the opposite in sales. One of my core beliefs is you cannot be perceived to be better until you're first perceived to be different, and I'm gonna be teaching you how you can be different in every facet of your selling life. Our tactic TV show, if you feel dizzy when you get hit with an objection, you'll feel dizzy seeing the wheel of objections spin around, but you will be stabilized because our great friends, Josh Braun and Sam McKenna will be helping handle, overcome, address, whatever word you wanna use, those objections. And as part of our toolkit, that wonderful friend of ours, Josh Braun, is going to be giving away a number of his tongue tied objection talk tracks. And that's a wrap, folks. So as a reminder, we talked about the launch of Twitter. We talked about the launch of YouTube. We talked about the launch of Tactic TV, and we gave you Jason Bey as part of the club who's leading off the content road map. And if you were only to do one thing right now, do one thing, pull out your phone or your laptop, whatever you're listening this thing on, and open up the show notes for this episode and click the link at the top of the episode. And whatever resonated with you most, please take action on that. That might mean you follow us on Twitter. That might mean you sign up for a tactic TV show, or it might mean that you are an early subscriber of YouTube because YouTube is launching in a couple weeks, and you're not gonna wanna miss your first peek of that. Alrighty, folks. Thanks for listening to another 30 MPC roadmap episode. Signing off. Cheers. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
