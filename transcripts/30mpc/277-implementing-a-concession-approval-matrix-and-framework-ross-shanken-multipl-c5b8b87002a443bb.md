## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents' Club. My name is Arman Frogg, and I'm here with my host, Marc Casaglow. And today, we have Ross Schenken, the VP of sales over at Multiplier and the first ever episode we've had on all things around pricing. Marc, why should people listen? I don't know if people have heard of Multiplier. It's one of the fastest growing companies on the planet right now, and this is the guy that is orchestrating the engine. You know he's got stuff to drop, and I thought he dropped it. So let's go. This was a freaking good one if you ever have been confused about deal structure, folks. And so three, two, one. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, Ross. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Takeaway number one, effective Monday team meeting. So all leaders typically have a, weekly stand up on Mondays. So every Monday, you wanna kick start the week to ensure we're rolling in the same direction and focus on the right key initiatives. So in order to do this, you gotta have a structure in place where we connect, we celebrate, we learn, communicate, and prioritize. So first, when we connect, we're learning about people's weekends, any fun facts, things that were going on, getting people to communicate so it's not just the sales manager show, but more about them opening up to the rest of the team. Next, we want to celebrate. Let's celebrate the team and what they did last week. Did they win any big deals? Did anyone get married? Any big celebrations? Then we wanna learn from each other. Typically, you're gonna wanna have one of your teammates be the one to present on their key learnings. So everyone is learning about the action item together. Then this is your job to communicate any changes that are happening, any expectations for them. That's really important to communicate at the team level meeting, and then prioritize what are your key focus areas? What are the things that you want them to remember for the next four or five business days? Boom. What's number two? Number two, Mark's favorite, speedy meetings. Meetings suck, but they can be better with speedy meetings. So this is where all meetings start at the five minute mark, and they end at the thirty minute or at the end of the hour. So it reduces chances that people are typically being late when they're running back to back on Zoom calls, but they're gonna thank you when they have five minutes to run to the restroom, grab a beverage, grab a quick bite to eat. So for you as a people leader, you also don't wanna be the leader that's always late to their one on ones or their meetings and being a disrespectful manager. Set your meetings to speedy meetings and watch your world change. Watch our world change with no further ado. He is in sales, Mondo. He's in sales. I sell Speedy Meetings as well as EOR. So whatever you need, Mark. One of the greatest takeaways of all time. Okay. Alright, Ross. Bring us home. What's number three? Number three, concession approval matrix and levers. So it's important to create a concession approval matrix and framework at each level of leadership, including the AE, to encourage stronger pricing integrity habits and uniformity across each segment that accounts for commitment, which is like the usage or users, the term, one year term, two year term, the product suite or number of SKUs if you're a multi product solution, and even billing frequency. It becomes messy when your largest customers are paying more per unit than your smaller customers due to a poor pricing framework. So do this early and it's still the right behavior. Alright. First question. So you have this really nice framework. I love a good framework. It helps you know what you need to roll in on Monday morning having ready. People know what to expect. Is this explicit? Do you have a slide that says connect? A slide that says celebrate, or is it like a known flow that you use? How does a rep see what you're doing with this? I think it's starting to become, like, organic with the rep of what to expect in a Monday team meeting, and that's important. They wanna know what they're walking in on. We instilled really early in our, like, sales leadership that we have to make them enjoyable for us to show up, or else our reps are sitting back in their chairs. They're unengaged. They're thinking about all of their other deals. But as a first time leader years ago, I actually had stress on Fridays and Monday mornings when I was creating my deck of, like, what am I going to talk about this week? Is my team getting value out of it? Is like the biggest question I want to answer each meeting. So how do you know it's fun? Because fun is the fuel for hard work. Hard work makes you feel like you're contributing and every human wants to contribute to stuff. Right? So fun is like this one of these baseline things for me, like, listen, connect, celebrate, learn, communicate. That sounds cool. It doesn't sound fun. Help me how do you make it fun, man? The first part is the fun part. So when we connect, sometimes we have, like, an open ended question. Some of our favorites are, is a hot dog a taco? What's your favorite dessert? When you're in this, like, remote Zoom environment, you just don't have the shoulder connection you used to have with your sales team on the floor. And so there's only so many opportunities for you to actually get to know each other if you're not listening to each other's calls and Clary Gong, etcetera. And so this at least opens the floor up a little bit. Sometimes, based on the mood of the team, it's a little bit more forced, so you have to read the room. Not everyone wants to answer their favorite dessert. But more times than not, we're getting the team communicating a little bit amongst themselves. And your favorite dessert is? Chocolate chip cookie melted with vanilla ice cream. Cool. I like Kevin Mondo for dessert, but go ahead, Mondo. I'll see you up. I think a lot of times, these Monday morning meetings, everyone's tired. It happens at 8AM or 9AM. People are multitasking. And frankly, the sales leader comes in because they have to. And all of the Monday morning meeting structures that I've seen, the good ones all have similar elements to them. But what I usually see outstanding leaders do is they realize that if I'm not gonna get up on Monday, my team is not gonna get up. And so we had this thing where my team would sort of roll their eyes at it. But in the last week of the quarter, every Monday morning meeting Ross, you'll appreciate this because you're a Drake fan. I would, like, start every end of quarter week with that song on screen share and keep it up uncomfortably longer until the entire team was dancing. I would refuse to stop until someone would be on their feet being like, let's go. It's in the corner. And it's like those little things out of the transfer of enthusiasm in sales. We're not doing some boring bean counting career. There's a leaderboard. There's a gong. There's all these things. And so, Ross, you talked about the learn piece where you're oftentimes having one of your reps teach something to the team. Could you talk about how do you actually structure that piece? Are you pre deciding on a topic? Is it basically anyone can volunteer to teach someone something and they're going off the cuff? How do you structure the learn portion where someone else is taking the stage? Yeah. For sure. I love that you're playing music when your Monday morning meetings. Oftentimes, we'll do the same. Some things that are fun is sometimes like, if we really need a pick me up, I'll dress up in, like, a costume. Sometimes I've worn a suit. Sometimes I've worn, like, a seventies outfit just to get us in the right mood for the day. You know, it's tough. The number of screenshots that have been taken of me in a Monday meeting are countless. So to your original question of how are we structuring that and setting it up for success to for a key learning of the team. Typically, in that last element we're prioritizing, we're gonna have like a theme of the week. But as we know that we typically have these sales initiatives, whether it's Medpicks a new initiative, setting next steps is an initiative, whatever that initiative may be. Those are the things that we are looking for within the rep sales calls to highlight of like, Hey, here's an example of us doing the thing that we talked about doing. And, if in the event we can't find one, we'll then find, like, an objection. We'll find, just a rep talking through a deal that they won that was against a competitor. You know, we had teams with multiple managers. I'd ask the managers the week prior if there's any good examples and volunteers that we feel like could be a good representation of the team. Or if it's myself, you know, I'm going through calls constantly, so seeing areas and then asking the rep if they're comfortable sharing that on the Monday team meeting, and they'd give them a allotted period of time, which is typically, like, five to seven minutes. I think the theme of this area is have a structure. But, like, what I'm taking away from it mostly is just this kinda, like, fun, don't take yourself too seriously, have your music going. Completely agree. We started to do themes when it came to, like, our monthly kickoffs too, where we would have pairs of hosts and we would dress up and we'd make the deck all different themes. The emo theme was a big hit. I think Bachelor or The Bachelorette was a huge hit. So we were giving roses to each other. And you can just go based off, like, whatever is top of mind or culture specific. Are you doing any sort of metrics review or any sort of review of numbers, commitments, etcetera, in your Monday morning meeting in the communicate and prioritize portions towards the end? And or are you keeping this metric light and more professional development and mindset focused? I think this is probably a debate for many sales leaders. I definitely see the purpose of showing, like, the scoreboard and where we're at, etcetera. In my experience, and open to a debate here, I've seen you just fall flat. Most salespeople care about themselves and not about others. They obviously care about a dashboard, and they typically have that as a bookmark on their inbox. But I see it just fall a little bit flat when I'm showing these metrics, and here's what we need to do. Well, I wanna move into the concession approval matrix, Ross. I think this is a very interesting idea. So what I'd love is first of all, is that something that you can share? Is there something that you can share with us that we could show people? I'm sure I can mask one and make it empty and share you, like, what it looks like based on, headcount or users, free incentives, what levels of approval. I can definitely provide something. I just did this actually at Multiplier, and I'm still learning everything about the business. Inherently, if we're able to make these things approved by Saga, etcetera, it's going to inherently change the behavior of the reps on how they wanna sell deals. And we're gonna be giving some pretty good incentives for them to sell the way that we want them to sell. And so the thought here is that I'm a rep, and I'm about to go into a call where we're gonna talk commercials. And I have my little piece of paper next to me. Is it a work sheet, or is it literally like a laminated thing that I look at and, like, color by number? I wish I did have an example for us to walk through prior. So essentially, it's a it's a large grid, and it's broken out by, typically how we bill, which is on users. And so we have, you know, an X to Y, a Y to Z, category. And so for you to get to, like, the next set of discounts, you would need to get to that next benchmark. And then there's going to be, different levels where the AE is going to see what their floor is, and then they're gonna see what their manager's floor is too. And so hopefully, they're articulating only what they can approve. And then if there's a part of a conversation where, Mark, you say, Hey, Ross, I need to get to this discount level, you can truthfully say, like, I need to actually loop in my manager here. Like, I need to talk with them. And the thing that we're really solving is that now the managers are being brought into these deals earlier than before, and they're getting to answer questions. So the rep is saying, hey, I need a x percent discount or else they won't move forward. And say, oh, why is that? Right? The manager gets to be involved. They get to learn about the deal. And more times than not, they're probably going to approve if it meets their, you know, criteria. But it just gives the AEs a little bit of a framework to not just be offering the world without a commitment. So when you lock somebody in to, like, a framework, there's always gonna be buyers that wanna push the outside of that. How do you help your sellers understand that? Yeah. More times than not, they do too. They wanna push outside of it, and it's up to our, account executive team to really uncover the reason behind the ask. And so if our pricing is ever more than you know, we're getting pushed back on the pricing. I always ask to try to understand their expectations, you know, what they expected around our price and how does that differ from it. And then try to uncover, like, where they got those previous expectations from. Mhmm. It could be from the competitors, but it also could be what they're doing today, which may not be applicable. Or it could be a number that they made up in thin air, which was also not applicable. And so those are, like, the questions that we'd wanna get to before we continue to go down the concession path. I would love to get granular on some of the specific terms inside of this grid. So let's start with the most obvious one, which is just discount percentages. Right? At a previous team to not be named, reps were able to discount up to 20%. K? After that, anything further would require manager approval, and then there was a certain amount for VP approval. And we didn't wanna slow deals down from a 10% discount. That was the thought behind it. But then there were more approvals for things like multiyear deals just because we were so early in our life cycle. So if we just start with the pricing, the discount piece, what types of break points have you generally seen whether at your current job or past jobs for the rep manager VP level approvals or any other approvals? One of the break points that, is really important to do, I I think you can absolutely say 10% or 20% or 30%, whatever it may be, by actually, like, taking a look at what's the rep average before we put a framework in place and trying to increase or, you know, decrease their ability to discount a little bit just to see if there's a little stronger pricing integrity before they start bringing in a manager where the manager is now at the average. And we slowly get to a place where we're getting stronger and stronger on our price integrity and delivering more value in our sale. I like that a lot. Do you see similar types of break points on deal size for quarterly, monthly, whatever types of payments, or is it more of a case by case basis for your team? I can't say of too much experience in that. We've done a pretty good job in, you know, all the companies I've been at to have pretty strong pricing integrity. But if I were to look at that, I'd probably take a look at where does this stop making sense for us to do this deal, you know, on our cost of customer acquisition or payback period, and then really make, a business decision if we wanna be hovering around there, if the logo is really attractive or it gets us to be a reference for a next set of customers that are interesting to us. They're not typically something I've been around. Ross, in the opening session, one of the things that you talked about when you're introducing this concept was the fact of what happens when you end up with bigger customers that are actually have worse price points than smaller customers. Like your reps got crazy for one quarter because you were close to your number and you needed to do a few things. And now you got people that are paying $10 that their unit cost is half of what your million dollar customers are paying. How does this situation prevent that? How does this help with that? What I've seen work in the past is when you have different levers and discount approvals by those units. And so your SMB team can't discount as much as your mid market team, and your mid market team can't discount as much as your enterprise team. The challenge is, you know, as you become more tenured as, an account executive, you're able to sell on value a lot more frequently and more naturally than someone that's a little bit earlier in their career who may be, little more advantageous to to discount faster in the sales cycle. And so I've seen it before where we've seen some enterprise customers pay more per unit than, like, a mid market customer, and that's because the rep is really strong. They articulated the value. They create a business case for the enterprise customer. So the framework helps prevent that. I've had a lot of people asking me, Mark, new business is so hard. Acquisition is down. Pipeline is down. And one of the things that I did at Catalyst, where we doubled revenue in a little over a year, was I empowered my reps. And I was like, listen, he who makes the deal wins the deal. And so I was like, listen, I was saying yes to discounts I would never have touched at Outreach. And and the current economic environment, how are you helping people deal with discounting? Because, boy, our CFOs I have one person say they're called CF no's right now. And so how are you getting them CF no's to CF yes's? Well, I don't think price can always be the driver, but there has to be the initiative before the price. But I do think you're going to see a lot of players that aren't, like, the number one in the space win a lot of deals. There's a clear reason why there is a number one. But if the number two can do 80% of the number one at 70% of the price, you're gonna see a lot of those customers win. Mhmm. They're much more flexible. They're doing the majority of the software that you're purchasing it to accomplish. And so I'm starting to see it, like, just from my network of of people that these number two players are winning a lot. So do you think that if you're number one, you should discount more? Do you think if you're number two, you should continue the aggressive discounting? Like, that's what I'm kind of after is, like, you're in the market. You have a discounting question. Do you believe, like, right now is the time to discount more than normal, or do you think now is the time to try to really hold on price? This would be my take. I think it's important for you and the customer to agree that you are the best product to support them. If you can agree on that, then we shouldn't let the price get in the way of them choosing the best vendor for them within reason. Right? If they're comparing us to the number two in the market, I get that. But if they're comparing our apples to their oranges, that doesn't make sense to me. I totally agree with that, which is we're always the most expensive by sometimes, like, a puke worthy margin. And in the bull market, we could get away selling a deal at 45 k when someone else would be selling it at sometimes 15 or 10. We'd literally be three x the price. But it got to the point where, obviously, no HR leader could justify that type of thing. And so we might have to still settle at 20 or 25 and honestly drop our pants to win a deal. But the first question that needed to be answered was, are we vendor of choice? Are we the superior solution? Because if we're not, we're just setting up our CS team for a cheap churn bomb that's, like, massively unprofitable. Speaking of churn bombs, there's one other topic that I've seen a million different ugly structures on multiyear deals. I asked 10 people how they structure multiyear deals. Do they do ELAs, flat deals, all that stuff, price locks, and you get a million different answers. So I'm curious, what type of guidance do you give your reps on how to structure a multiyear deal? And do you maybe have one or two examples of what a good multiyear deal would look like versus a bad one? Yes. I've done both. So why don't we first start with the bad? Let's talk about the market a couple years ago. Everyone is investing in themselves. They're doubling headcount. They're doubling revenue. And, in order for us to get those next tiers of approvals that we talked about before, we can get to lower price points. And so we'd often have employers or companies commit to a higher headcount because that was in their trajectory in the near term future. And so we saw a lot of these companies, say, Yeah, for sure. We're gonna be there. The reqs are open right now. And, once you say yes to us, like, you're committed to those number of users, but, you know, what happens when interest rates go up, we've flattened our orgs, we have higher manager ratios, we're doing more with less, And now we never reach those number of employees, and we're not even close to them. And so that's an example of a challenging conversation that customer success is having today. They've purchased licenses that are not in use. And how are the companies, the software vendors of the world, gonna right size it? That's example of the bad. And so in that type of deal, essentially let's put numbers to it. I might have been a rep who sold what's called an escalator deal, so a fifty to seventy five k deal. So it's 50 k year one, 75 k year two. And that year two price increase is based on the assumption that this customer is going to grow and probably a price per seat increase or something like that just because things increase over time by a couple percentage points. And what happened with most teams is they didn't grow, they shrank. Right? But I would argue that in a bull market, that would have been the right deal to sign. And so today, if you're not signing escalator deals for growth, are you signing flat deals? How do you grok a multi year deal when someone's basically saying, Yeah, this contract is pretty much going to stay the same for two years. Yeah. Here's my favorite, is price based incentives on tiers, where users decrease as headcount increases, but not retroactively. So let's imagine, you're a thousand users, and we say your first thousand users are going to be at $5 easy numbers. But your next 500 users are gonna be at $4 The first thousand are still billed at $5 and only the next people are billed at $4 And so it helps just create the better economies of scale for the companies that are growing. And as they're decreasing, they know what those different tiers of employees are at when they're purchasing software. That's my favorite. I love that one too. Do you do the thing where, okay, we know you're buying a thousand, but if you go all the way back to 500, you're gonna go up to $7? Have you done that part? I haven't personally. No. Yeah. I found that incentivizes people to help understand, alright, we're selling you a thousand person deal. A 500 person deal is substantially different. You can't just go backwards and still receive the discount that we gave you for the thousand person deal. So it's a way to have an insurance policy against the volume based discount. And right now, like we all know, like that second year, if you oversell, you're gonna take a contraction at the best and a churn at the worst. I think you can sometimes avoid some of the impact of a contraction by having that backstop of, you know, if you go below this, we're gonna actually raise your price instead of just always looking forward right now. Yeah. I think that structure makes a lot of sense. Because, organically, if I'm thinking about it and you signed for a thousand users, like, that's your minimum. And what we've seen, organizations have downsized. They went from a thousand to 800 employees. What are they doing with those 200 licenses? And so it helps them make it, a little bit easier to swallow when, like, hey. Now I'm only paying for 800 users, but I'm paying more than my $5 that I agreed to because I'm not having the commitment of a thousand employees. I like that structure a lot. To just clarify exactly how you guys are structuring this deal is in Mark's world, let's say that I bought a thousand seats at $5 per seat. If I decide to cut half my workforce and I drop to 500 seats, I might now charge, instead of $5 a seat, 7 or $8 a seat, for example. So my total contract is not getting cut in half. It's probably getting cut by 25%. But if I go up and I choose to add users, when you first sign this deal, Ross, it doesn't sound like there's a TCV or a total contract value, a multi year contract value on the deal because you actually don't know how many seats they're gonna be at in the future years. But what you are doing is you're mapping out future price tiers for twelve fifty seats, for 1,500 seats, for 2,000 seats. And it really just depends how much they grow next year. So you're kicking that countdown down the road. Is that correct? Yeah. I've also seen the structure, like I just mentioned, where that thousand person minimum, whatever that price may be, that is your minimum contract value annually. And so when we put it into our metrics and for quota retirement for our reps, it's the two years, three years at that price. And we know that it can really only go up from there because if it goes down, they're still on the hook for the thousand users at that price. So last topic on this one, and then we have to wrap. How do you compensate multi year deals? I love this. It was always a battle with finance. And it's a great conversation to have because you just wanna make sure that your CFO also likes to have customer retention. And if they do, then let's incentivize reps to have multiyear deals. That's the best way to incentivize the behavior of a rep is through monetary gain. I've seen a couple different structures, curious on your guys' take. I've seen, the first year is paid out, like, typical one year, however that may be, X percent. And then I've seen, two different areas. I've seen one where the second year is then having, like, a kicker, which may be, maybe half the one year value, or I've seen, a spiff based model, but my preference would be the smaller percentage on the consequential years. Yeah. I've always done the spiff based model, an extra 5% or 3% or whatever it is for every out year after that. That way, people are incentivized to do two, three, four year deals. That's been the most common way I've done it. I tried it the other way a couple times, and it it always felt like we got into disagreements about what was going on. For me, at least, that was in my experience. So for example, if I get paid 10% on year one, you might pay me an extra 3% or 4% for year two. That extra 4% is still based on year one ARR. So you're not arguing about, oh, let's project out how many employees this company is gonna add. Is that right? So I've tried it that way and gotten pushback from reps a lot. So what I end up doing is we estimate every year. So let's say we have three years, and one year's at 10, one's at 15, one's at 20. Then we take all three years. So together, 10 plus 15 plus 20 is $35,000. We divide that by three, and we take the $12. We pay commissions on that. Then we pay the SPIF'd amount on top of that for however many years out it goes. Gotcha. And that model wouldn't necessarily work with the future pricing grid model where you don't know where they're going to land. That would have to be in a you've already determined that year two is 15 is is gonna be a 150 k, year three is going to be 200 k. Which I think we've also talked about probably isn't the right thing to do in this market, honestly. Yeah. We would do it the same way, Mark. We'd average out the years if it's two years, three years, four years, and then use that SPIFF based model. Fascinating. Well, Ross, this was a blast of interview. Not only did we get the best tactic of all time in Speedy meetings Speedy meetings. This is the first time we've ever gotten to talk through pricing, which is something near and dear to my heart. So we have to move to the final question. The final question is, Ross, we talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit. Now it's time to talk about a bad one. So what is one bad habit that every sales leader should break today to make every sales team a little bit better. Definitely. I'm gonna talk about co selling. So co selling is when the manager and the rep are working together on a deal. I see a lot of managers jumping in immediately in the deal because they are typically pretty good. They were promoted internally. They know what they're doing. I'd say stop it. Let the rep struggle a little bit. Let them learn from their mistakes. Obviously, if we're going overboard, save it, but you gotta let the rep learn from their own challenges and let them experience the struggle, so that you can then make that a a learning moment for them. Boom. Totally agree. Let them fall. Let them get a scab, and everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Two by two number one, make sure your Monday morning meetings are fun. We can read off a bunch of numbers and thank Billy for this and Jenny for that, and we run through thirty minutes of 18 slides and put everybody to sleep on Monday morning. Or you can dress up like Drake, throw down some bars and have your backup senior management team, like having your back and being your hype man. Like, that sounds like a Monday morning meeting to me. Let's go. Boom. Let's go. And then number two, I really like this one is when you're doing your discounting approval matrix, the first place to look is what is your average discount right now in that area of the business and then make the matrix just a little bit better. See if you can't get a little incremental revenue out of improving discounting by making sure that you're tuning your matrix and approvals to what the current average is. I thought that was a baller move. Number three. Another grid is the multiyear deal grid where maybe two years ago, you could assign a $507,500 k escalator deal over three years. And now the problem is a lot of these customers aren't growing. And so what you might choose to do instead is you might say, hey. If you reach 1,250 seats or if you reach 1,500 seats, here's how you get economy of scale in future years, but we're not going to pre agree on growth. And if you happen to shrink, here's how your price proceed will actually go up so that we protect ourselves from the downside by protecting you on the upside. And then lastly, number four, speedy meetings. I have been the manager who has been five minutes late to every one on one, And, eventually, I got freaking tired of apologizing at the beginning of every single one on one, so I just started doing all of them at the o five mark, and you would be amazed how much more calm you enter these meetings and how much more your team appreciates it when you have a second to go to the bathroom between your four back to back meetings. So, folks, if you like this one, go connect with Ross on LinkedIn. Tell him you love this show, and hang on for the next episode of 30 MPC leadership edition. Peace out. Sponsored by Speed Meetings.
