## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, guess what, folks? We already gave you one gift from Charlotte Johnson, and she gave away her cold email drip for free. All of her email templates that would typically go into 10 to 15 touches over thirty days, you can get those in the show notes here. And now she's backing it up with a podcast episode too, breaking out everything you need to know about cold emails. Nick, why should people listen? I think the most impressive thing about Charli is she does a really, really good job standing apart from other salespeople in the words she uses to start her cold emails, in the way that she makes cold calls, in the way that she kicks off discovery meetings. She has a lot of really small tweaks and suggestions that you can make to how you're running your sales life to have the prospect say, wait a minute. This person's a little bit different. So I had a lot of fun with this episode, Armand. Three, two, one. This episode's a little bit different. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, Charli. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Yeah. So number one is take your research that one step further than other people and be smart about using it. So what I mean by this is don't just use generic personalization or the first thing you come across when you're researching someone. Like, everyone is using that first thing that they see on someone's LinkedIn profile, using their company, using their industry. So take it that one step further than other people you're competing against for your prospect's time. So for example, if you're using a funding announcement, don't just say congrats on the funding announcement just like every single other person is gonna do. Say exactly what in the article you found interesting. And I'd even start it with quotations of the point. Whatever it says, expansion into The US found this really interesting in your funding announcement that you posted about. Beautiful. What's number two? So number two is incorporate more humanness into your PS. And being more human sounds so obvious, but the challenge that a lot of people have with standing out today is that we've all incorporated this common salesy language that we've been taught over time. But the issue is that's making it really difficult for us to then actually stand out because we all then sound the same just like little sales robots, and our prospects can smell the desperation and, smell that sales y language from a mile off. So for example, using this especially in the PS is probably one of my top tips. So if you see your prospect has a dog and you have a dog, share the fact that you both have dogs in the PS and maybe sprinkle in a gift for their dog or something like that. So adding in that humanness into the PS. Very nice. Round us out. What's number three, Charlie? So make your outreach a pattern interrupts, and the above being human actually ticks this. But what I'm talking about here is incorporating different structures in your outreach in order to stand out. So not using the classic repetitive sales emails, phone call scripts, etcetera. So as an example, instead of starting every email with, hi, first name, I saw on LinkedIn that started with something like reading your careers page and found this role interesting first name. Alright. So, Charlie, a lot of emails that look exactly the same to me. It's like the same two word subject line. It always starts with hello, Armand, and then it typically goes into noticed that some generic research. You do some things really unique to how you make that research pop out in an email, whether it's the preview text or the subject line, what have you. So let's say I have some cool piece of research for lack of a better word. How do I make that pop out the moment it hits the inbox? I don't know why we don't just start emails with the personalization. I don't know why we have to start with hi first name. I noticed that and have it really long winded. And the only reason I kinda thought about this is because when I read my own emails, I get very uninterested very quickly. So I skim over my inbox, and I quickly delete the ones that don't stand out. So I was like, well, actually, I'm probably doing this in my prospects inbox as well. So how can I stand out? So one of the things that I do is that I actually front load the personalization. I don't even put, hey, first name. I will literally say what I found interesting, and I'll try not to use words like I noticed that or I saw that because everyone uses that. So one of my favorites is use starting it with words like browsing on the SDR role you're hiring for first name, and then I add their first name at the end. So So if you look at your inbox, everything says, hi, first name. Hi, first name. Hi, first name. So mine, when I'm saying browsing on your SDR role you're hiring for first name, instantly just stands out. And that small little difference really kinda makes a difference. We saw quite an uptick in, like, open clicks and reply rates just from adding the first name to the end of that sentence. I'm curious. You mentioned some of the examples of stuff you were looking for to weave into the email. So I've heard you say funding announcement, hiring for a certain role. You're including if you see that they have a a certain type of pet. They've got a dog. You've got a dog. Two questions here. One, what other stuff are you looking for to weave into the personalized aspect of the email? And then the second part of that is, like, what if you can't find anything? Or what you can find is, like, incredibly dull? Like, there's not a lot about Armando on the Internet. Yeah. It's a good question. I'm gonna start with the second one. You're gonna have to remind me of the first question in a second. I actually think the fact that people are like, there's no no information on my prospect. Yeah. Personally, on someone, they might not do a lot of on LinkedIn. But being honest, I rarely use unless someone has something really powerful on their LinkedIn. I actually don't start with that as my personalization because I think it's just too obvious and everyone's using it. So I actually do the first thing I will do is I'll look at their careers page, understand where is this company investing their money. I will read the roles. Usually, at the top, it will tell you exactly where the company is focused on. Sometimes it will say, like, we're gonna be expanding into Amsterdam, so we need a Dutch speaking rep and things like that. So I can use that initially as my personalization. Other thing that's, like, a really easy thing to do, and I'd argue that not many people do this, is simply googling the company's name. And then just going on the news section and just understanding, like, they will obviously post about things that they care about. So is it the fact that they're getting a lot of inspiration partners and things like that? And if they are, I can use the hypothesis that I'm guessing that your partnership and growing your product to attract more people is a is a focus for you at the moment, even something so simple as that. You can link anything to your product. And the beauty of these hypothesis is that they don't need to be right. I'm probably wrong most of the time. When I am right, I'm like, woah. I got it right. But how the hell are you supposed to know what the company's focus and challenges you're not going to? And all you have to be doing for this, like, pipeline general is just gaining a bit of interest. And in order to do that, I just think creating this hypothesis and guess about what you think their focus is gives you enough credibility to earn the right to have a call to actually find out what their focus is. So there was a fun example that you gave earlier that I'd actually love to put into practice here. So you mentioned one thing you might have noticed on a career page was they were hiring for a Dutch SDR or something like that. Right? So let's say that I observe that, they're trying to hire the Dutch version of a young Nick Seagalski, and that's my tailoring. How would you weave that into an email and then tie that to a problem that you can solve? Yeah. So how I would start it, and especially if you know that person's gonna be on their team, is I'll either quote something. And I I I love starting emails with quotes. I just think it's very different, and I love to put it in italics because it's something that they know and something that they've written, so they should kinda recognize it. Or I will start it, like, quite informally and be like, wow. So many SDR hires. Or I'll be like, so cool that you're expanding into Amsterdam. I was reading the job spec for the Dutch SGR. Once I've done that, I will be like, look. And I'll be really honest. I I'm really, like, self deprecating in my emails as well. And I'll be like, look. I'm probably way off here, and I actually add stuff like in my email. I'm probably way off here with my guest. But, usually, the struggle that someone will have when they're expanding in a new geography is either this or this. Am I way off here, or am I at least a little bit close? Either way, best of luck growing the team. I used to live and maybe in the PS, I used to live in Rotterdam and would go to Amsterdam quite a lot. So definitely get them to check out this restaurant. It's the bomb. I'm curious to what extent are you considering cultural implications with emails like this? Because I see pros and cons. I see, okay, knowing that Germany is different than Amsterdam, you might change the way that you message. But I can also see, like, the law of diminishing returns applying where, like, you spend hours researching Dutch email culture, and you really slow yourself down. So what is your take on that? I personally, like, I'm just me, and that's how I am in my email outreach. I don't really adjust too much for different cultures because at the end of the day, they're gonna get on a call with me, and they're gonna realize that I'm not a mega serious person. I'm quite a lighthearted person, and and they're gonna find that out sooner or later. And I think one of the things that does benefit me and why people do react to my emails is because I am just myself. So whether we have so many different cultures in in sales often in our office in EMEA. Like, I can see a French, salesperson. I can see German salespeople. And, like, everyone is very similar. So, yes, some people might not react well to you being you, But I just think, like, there's no point wasting your life trying to be someone you're not, and it just makes it way less fun as well. Like, it's just so much fun being yourself and having a bit of fun with your outreach than just being really formal and someone you're not just to try and impress someone who you think might like this more than this, but you don't actually know. So, Charlie, one thing that I talk to folks about a lot is try to make your language more human. Read it out loud. Listen to how it sounds, but still sometimes you see a lot of really stiff language. For example, they won't use conjunctions or anything like that. If you were giving advice to someone on how to tactically get better at making their language sound human, do you have any advice to lend to folks? Yeah. And this is actually really difficult to notice that you're not being human because we're almost taught. I remember from day one at STR ing, I was almost taught to have this really vivid structure and to have a certain language. So it's almost, like, embedded into us today. It's actually really difficult to notice when you're doing it and when you're not. I would personally get, like, a an outsider's view on it, like or record yourself saying it as well. Record yourself saying your email. Listen back to it. And if you're like, what have I just said that does not sound like me? Then change it up a bit. One of my favorite things on SalesLoft is that you can email yourself a preview, and I will let that sit in my inbox. And I'll after I I I can still send the email to people, and I will have a look at it. And I'll just scan it and be like, is this too structured? And then start playing around with how I can move things, how I can make it a bit more different, easy to read, and things like that. So recording yourself, I think that's a great way. Like like you said, when you say stuff out, rather than it's like, we help companies like x, y, and z. It's just, like, slow, robotic, and repetitive. Get an outsider's view because you have a team who also has a has has insight into, like, what would be robotic or not. And also ask your persona as well. Something that I do a lot of is I actually just send templates and emails to people I've connected with. I'm like, look. We've never spoken before. We I target you, and I'm trying to up my, email game. Is this too formal? Would this stand out more? And I'll give them a few options. And usually people reply and be like, I actually prefer number three, which is like the really short informal chilled one. There's a quote that I heard which was if you ask for advice, you get money, and if you ask for money, you get advice. And I bet you get meetings, from people who are like, by the way, this actually might help me. One of the things that you put in our prep doc was the idea of pattern interrupting with your outreach structure. And I think there are a lot of salespeople that default to, alright. I send a manual email on day one. On day three, I make a call. The next day, they get a thoughts email. Can you talk to me about the things that you feel you're doing differently in the structure of your outreach? Yeah. Good question. And, like, everyone has cadences and sequences nowadays. And if you don't, then you probably should because you're not gonna be as consistent as the other people out there. But everyone has these structures. And I think there's, like, that a GoD one or something like that. And everyone just copies the same structure in the same sequence, and they just all use the same thing. And it's kind of, like, the same as having all the same email. So I think, like, yes, start with a baseline copy someone's, but iterate and change it from the results that you're getting. So I think, firstly, make sure yours isn't identical and you're constantly looking how to change it and improve it over time. And the second thing is just because you have a cadence or sequence doesn't mean you have to strictly follow it. You should be doing out of cadence activities as well. So something I do is I will follow people, especially in my tier one accounts, and I will create a list on Sales Nav so I can get updates when their company posts things or when they post things and or when they change jobs or whatever it might be, I get updates on Sales Navigator. And then I will do out of cadence activities from those triggers that I'm receiving from, from LinkedIn. So if they've just had a funding or they've been promoted or something like that, I'm not gonna wait for them to get into the next step of my sequence or my cadence. I'm I'm gonna give them a call, or I'm gonna send them an email, or I'm gonna send them a a reach desk or Sendoso. And I'm gonna do those out of cadence steps, which in my opinion are just as valuable as the ones you're doing within your cadences. Another example is if they're clicking on your email or they're clicking on a piece of content that you've sent them, don't, again, just wait for them to come up in their next step. Send them an email. Pick up the phone. Give them a call. Message them on LinkedIn. Like, I'm really informal when people, like, click on stuff that I've sent, and I'll just screenshot it. And sometimes I just send it on LinkedIn, and I'll be like, oh, what do you find interesting here? Hey, or something like that. And it's just like I'm not then being this sales robot, a, writing really boring emails, but, b, following this really strict and, like, processed approach. I'm being different, and I'm being more flexible and targeted to them, which I think people just appreciate as well. How do you make sure that an email that you send out of sequence or out of cadence doesn't conflict with another email that you have teed up possibly for the same day or the next day? Like, how do you sort of intertwine the messaging so it isn't very, very obvious that some is automated versus some is human you? My cadence isn't hugely automated. I'll be honest. I use templates a lot, but they will be very personalized to those people. Rarely do I have automated emails that are actually gonna, like, conflict. And I think it's diff unless you have very specific persona cadences, I think it's really difficult to automate content because they will care about different things. So for me, it's like, I will have templates which I can insert, which takes me two seconds, but will be things like hiring SDRs and stuff like that. And usually the automated emails I have are usually more like nurture content like, oh, because you have a sales team and I'm a salesperson, I found this webinar really useful, and I thought your sales team would as well. All of this stuff, I don't think me sending a one off email or a one off call and just don't see it conflicting. If anything, it's complementing each other. And I honestly don't care if I send two emails on one day or I send three emails on one day or two LinkedIn and email on one day as long as I'm being personalized. It could be difficult if you have very automated, like, pitchy emails, but personally, mine aren't. Mine are more insert templates on certain scenarios that I found out about them. So my guess is even though you're suggesting that we don't copy paste the same number of steps, mix of the steps, what have you, My guess is you probably still have some general guidelines for yourself on how much you space out touches and what the mix of those touches are between video, email, LinkedIn, cold calls, etcetera. So do you have any general rules of thumb? If someone's building out a drip over thirty days, how much spacing and how they should mix in different types of touches? I think in the first five days, you can be a lot higher with, like, the amount of content you send. Like, so for example, on day one, do three do three steps. Like, get your name known. We're not necessarily trying to make them book a meeting and buy immediately. We just wanna get them a bit curious about ourselves. So there's no reason why you can't have those three steps on day one. I have, for the first five days, like, a step on every single day. They're gonna know who I am, but if they're not ready to engage with me at that point, that's okay because I have the rest of the cadence of the sequence to prove that I deserve their time. So after those first five steps, I chill out a little bit, and I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna give them a bit of a break and let someone else have a bit of a chance. And I would probably the next five days, maybe leave things to three days, and then after that, it gets a bit longer. So I'm really concentrating at the beginning. And over the time period, it's getting more and more and more spaced out. And once someone gets to the end of my cadence, they're not finished. They then go into my deposit cadence, which is just one piece of content a month. But it's not me saying sales up does this, or here's our case study, or here's a guide we published. It's like, because you're in this industry or because you're a certain persona, here's a really useful podcast that our sales team have used to book meetings. So I'm then peppering them with really great content that's actually genuinely gonna help their team. It's not always related to SalesLoft, but it's gonna actually help their team. And then, eventually, they're gonna be like, you know what? This person's given me a lot of great content. Let me give them a give them a shot. Can you tell me more about this deposit cadence? Because I don't imagine you can only promote thirty minutes to presidents club every single month to your prospect. Questions on it. Is it all automated? And how if it isn't, how much tailoring are you doing in that deposit cadence? Third question I have related to it, like, are you still doing the out of cadence activities when they're in that that piece of it? I'd like to learn more about what you're doing there because I haven't heard much about a strategy like this. Yeah. So it is automated, but I have different ones. So, like, we have a certain amount of personas. Usually, information for SDR managers is gonna be different to what a CRO wants to engage with. So we'll have persona based deposit ones, and I'm gonna send them things that are actually gonna be valuable for them. And how I find this information, yes, for me, it's a lot easier because I'm sales and I sell to sales. But, actually, I don't know what CROs like to engage with, so it's not always as easy. And so what I do to find the information to put into it is I just ask. I just ask my persona, what content do you like to engage with? I'll ask our VP, here. What do you like to read? What articles do you read in the morning? What podcast do you listen to? Like, what do you like to engage with, and what do you find valuable? And I'll ask them to send me stuff, and I I do it to random as well on LinkedIn as well. I'll be like, look. I'm building out my nurture cadence. Is there anything that you particularly like to engage with, whether that's someone on LinkedIn, whether that's a certain article that your persona enjoys. And I ask people, and that's how I get my content. Then it's automated, and I do it, like, once a month just so it's not too much because they've just gone through my, like, sixteen, seventeen step cadence. But once a month and, yes, I do the out of cadence activities. If I see them comment on something or post something or start clicking on something, I then again will do that out of cadence activity. And the thing is, like, I've never had someone say, like, oh my god. Can you stop spamming me? It's always like, we have thoroughly enjoyed what you've been sending us. It wasn't the right time, and now is the right time. Charlotte, I'm curious about the amount of time and when you're dedicating it to your prospecting because you have a lot of other things that you need to do, put together proposals, show demos, have discovery calls. How do you work doing what you're doing here, which is extremely strategic and intentional and focused, but I can also see taking up thirty seven hours of your week. So what's your approach to weaving this into your work week? Yeah. Do you know what? It has been a struggle since moving to AE. Like, I've never done an AE role before, so I've had to do a lot of learning. So, yes, I've been a bit guilty of not doing it as consistently as I would like, but I still make sure that I do a certain amount a week. And how we're targeted and how we kind of, like, measure ourselves is we call it day one activities. So I make sure that I'm doing, like, 15 of these a week. If I'm not doing these, I don't build my own pipeline. I have to rely on inbounds, which might not be reliable sometimes, or I have to rely on SDRs who maybe they're having a bad week or a bad month. So I am strict that I need to do my own pipeline gen in order for me to feel comfortable about the pipeline coverage that I have. How it doesn't take up my entire day is the fact that we're really lucky in the fact that our solution can tell me exactly which of the steps that get me and leverage me the most results. So I will make sure I do those steps at the beginning, and I will have more cadences that are focused on different scenarios. So a cadence for someone who's hiring, a cadence for someone who has a full cycle AE team. So that content I'm adding in later on can be automated, and it's gonna be relevant to the fact that they're hiring people or the fact that they have a full cycle team who's gonna need different content for different, like, triggers as an example. The clock is ticking. We're running out of time. It's time for the final question. So, Charlie, we've talked about a lot of great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? I'm gonna do two things. Pitching as soon as you connect with someone on LinkedIn, I hate this so much. And I get it as well, which is just really annoying because I'm definitely not a decision maker. But, like, just pitching as soon as you connect with someone, like, it just doesn't work. I instantly remove them because I'm like, I know I'm gonna get spammed. Get rid of that salesy nature. Let them have a little breath, even interact with a few things before you message them, but don't pitch people the second they connect. They haven't connected because they're like, sell me. So break that. And the other thing is, like, try not to use such automated and templated emails within your cadences. Like, I've seen some of the stuff that our our managers get, and it's just so obvious that it's templated. So try and make sure that if you are using templates, you're being creative and you're inserting templates that are relevant to their scenarios, not just, oh, I'm guessing that pipeline is a focus and SalesLoft helps 10 times pipeline. It's just so obvious it's salesy, and no one's gonna reply to it. So stop with the templated boring emails. Add a bit of, like it doesn't even need to be personalization, but just add a little more focus into them. Wonderful. Charlie, thank you so much for joining us, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Charlie Johnson include number one, Don't start your emails with hi name or noticed that. That's junk filler text that clutters your preview view. Instead, just lead immediately with the research, ideally a quote from your research. Number two, try to research where they're spending their money. That means things like job postings, funding announcements, etcetera. But don't just say like, hey. Noticed you raised a round. Literally put a quote from the job posting or a quote from the funding announcement in your email. Number three, stop speaking like a robot. Use human language. I know that sounds really theoretical. One fun tactical example was, I'm probably way off base in my guess here. That is literally what Charlotte is putting inside of her emails, and you can do the same. And then lastly, number four, if they are clicking on your email, if they're popping into your sales, Navid, or if they're breaking in the news, email them. Don't worry about breaking all the other steps in your cadence or your sequence or whatever you're doing. Don't worry about breaking that up. Just send them a note one off outside of the drip. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us off here? Direct your eyes and your mind and your thumbs or your mouse to today's show notes because we are giving away Charlie's drip campaign. Yes. For free. All you gotta do is follow the link and download it, and you will be booking more meetings with a lot less effort. Thanks for listening. We'll see you all next week on thirty minutes to Presidents Club.
