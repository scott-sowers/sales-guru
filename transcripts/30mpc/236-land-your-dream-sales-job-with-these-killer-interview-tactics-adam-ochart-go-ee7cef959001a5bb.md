## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. I'm your host for today, Nick Sigelski, joined by my wonderful cohost, Arman Farrokh. And today, we have got a repeat guest, Adam Ochart, who is a sales manager at Gong. And, wow, if you want to learn how to land a killer sales job at one of the most killer sales orgs out there, this is a clinic. Armand, why should people listen? Adam has the rare combination of three things. Number one, he is a sales manager who has outstanding interviewing skills. Number two, it's not like it's been a million years since Adam was a rep, so he understands what it's like to be in a rep's shoes. But then number three, he's working at one of the best companies out there in Gong, and you will get a sense of what a world class interview process looks like and how you can nail that process yourself. A three, a two, a one, a killer episode. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to dock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes.

So today we're talking about interviewing and how to land a job in today's market. The first is about building champions each step of the way as you go through the interview process. So first person you're gonna talk to is typically recruiter. On that closing call, when you meet with that person, find out if they're gonna move you forward. And at that point, set up a separate conversation with them. You should block fifteen minutes to allow them to prep you for that next meeting. I would say a good portion of people do this. Not as many as probably should, but people stop there. And then you hop on that hiring manager interview, run that same play. Don't stop running that play and continuously build champions each time you go through a new interview step. And by the time you get to the final bots, you should have an army of champions that you can read into. Beautiful. What's number two? Number two. This one's actually interesting because it's something I didn't know about when I was running through the interview process. But pre draft your thank you emails and get those out as soon as possible. Something that I learned as a hiring manager, as soon as an interview ends, I'm getting an email from the applicant tracking system, the hiring manager, and sometimes from my boss saying, I need the feedback in there quickly. Let's move swiftly. We wanna communicate with you really quickly. So I put in my feedback. I put in my notes, and I figure that out. I would say realistically, thirty to forty five minutes after, sometimes sooner. Well, what happens is people send these incredible follow-up emails that actually make me more bullish on them as a person to join my team and make me think, wow, they'd be incredible if they're on my team, but it's too late. And this happens quite frequently with someone that I'm on the fence. So set yourself up for success. Have that pre drafted. Think about the things you know about the business you know about them. Add in a few notes that show you were actively listening, and fire that thing off as soon as possible. This is a huge difference maker that I think is easy. Round us out, Adam. What's number three? This one here is something that may seem obvious, but, candidly, not a lot of people do. Have a list of unique questions, and don't be afraid to put the interviewer under the hot seat. You are interviewing for a job just as they're interviewing you. Right? So interview about the business and assess the risk. Ask questions about where the business is doing well and isn't doing well. Ask them about their strengths as a manager, their weaknesses as a manager. And we'll dive more into this in a bit, but make sure you come prepared with questions that are going to be unique so you stand out, but also assess that risk within their business in that role. Adam, I'm actually gonna reverse the interview to start this off. So let's say that we have interview number one with hiring manager Adam Ochart. What are you looking to suss out? Or how do you structure interview? Because that will inform how I should be preparing for it as a candidate. We look at, primarily, within the hiring manager interview, business acumen and skill set for the job. Will they hit the ground running? Do they understand our sales motion or will they be able to adapt to it? How have they been successful historically as a seller? I would say that's 80% of the interview process, and then 20% is cultural. I wanna get to know this person. If I hire someone, we're gonna spend a ton of time together. Are we gonna be able to have a good working relationship and enjoy our time together? And and that needs to be mutual. So those are the things that I'm typically looking for. I'm gonna double that. I've had people that are interviewing me. What are you looking to uncover in this interview? My blanket answer is first thing you should say when you jump onto a call is, like, hey. Sometimes on these calls, I know it's behavioral. Sometimes I know it's skill based. What is the theme of this conversation, and what is the main thing you wanna uncover as you interview me today? That question is gonna give you a blueprint of how you should structure that call. And so let's say, for example, this person gets on the interview and you've prefaced it that it's gonna be 80% business acumen type of stuff, past results, yada yada yada, 20% more cultural. My guess is you still start these interviews with some semblance of, alright. Tell me about yourself. What are the do's and don'ts of walking someone through your resume? Who have you seen in the past that has nailed that, and who have you seen in the past that has driven you insane within the first thirty seconds? This is, like, a huge thing that's a pet peeve of mine. I start every single interview saying, I've read your resume. I've seen your LinkedIn. I briefed with the hiring manager. Let's talk about everything before what I can see in your resume. I wanna know nothing about you professionally. I wanna know about you as an individual. And I'll give you the floor, two, three minutes, and start wherever you want, end wherever you want. It's a complete blank slate. So I start all my interviews like that. Because number one, we're in sales. I wanna make sure, like, are they a storyteller? Are they captivating? Are they interesting? And I'm not saying that that is something that is one to one and how they perform, but I think the best sellers tell a good story, hold a good conversation. The 95% of people will tell you, like, one small thing. I grew up in Glendale, California, and I went to SLOW, and I got my first job at Oracle, and they go into, like, the resume. So it's like, I don't know if this person's actively listening. Number one, make sure you understand what it is that they're asking about your personal life. Tell that and stay there. One other thing I'll highlight, we remember things in thirds. So do things in threes. If I was interviewing today and someone said, tell me about yourself, I have three bulleted life events or mini stories that I would talk through that'll be really, really crucial. So okay. It's like, if you interview and said, hey, you have two minutes to tell me about yourself. I'd say, okay, cool. Three things you need to know about me. Number one, I was an EMT at 18. That formed my life as I was in college working, you know, neonatal intensive care. Number two, at Gong, I launched a European business unit. It was a crazy life experience. I'm happy to tell you more about that. And number three, family is the most important thing for me. And I'd leave it vague and let them ask questions. Let them pick and pull. But again, having a bit of structure is gonna be really important there as well. I love how you talk about having different compelling life events or stories that tell a broader theme about you. The way that I've answered that question in the past myself is somewhat similar, except I'll pick one. And I'll usually talk about my story as a wrestler back in the day. And I'll talk about that, and I'll say, oftentimes describe myself as the world's most naturally untalented wrestler. And then at the end, I'll bring that home and explain how that I'm also probably the world's most naturally untalented seller. And that's why I think I've gotten half good at this thing is because I've had to learn how to learn in many other aspects of my life. So I love this concept of, like, having personal stories that tell them something about you. Where do you take the interview after this? Someone's introduced themselves. What are the first types of questions that you're asking to crack open the can of what is the seller actually capable of selling at my organization? So the transition from getting to know them a little bit, because we'll have a bit of dialogue there into the actual work discussion. I personally just like to get a sense of, like, hey. Before we dive into numbers, why are you looking for a new role? And the question I'll typically ask is, you start working at Gong tomorrow, and we fast forward to December 1 next year. What needs to be true outside of quota attainment for you to say that that was a good move? You know, I wanna get a sense on what matters to them and what's important to them from work perspective. Everyone's gonna say money, but what else matters? And does that align with our culture as a business? And then from there, what does a perfect day in the job look like for you? Because I wanna make sure that the way that they function and what they want to do as a seller is really aligned with my rep stated they look like. And then from there, I say, okay. Cool. Let's take a second and step back. I'd love to unpack, you know, your last few years in sales. Can we go over some of those numbers? And and we ask everyone to come prepared with numbers in terms of attainment and so on. So I'm actually curious about this one, Adam, because when you are leaving a job, it's very, very rarely it's like, oh, yeah. Gong was truly the coolest company in the world, and I saw you on an ad. And I just had to apply there and leave the place where things were going great. Most people, when they're leaving jobs, they've got some grievances. How do you wanna hear from the person that you're interviewing the reason that they're looking to leave and the reason that they're looking to go to Gong? Yeah. I actually have to give credit to Wendy Harris, who's my mentor or one of my mentors who I reach out to her about this. I started managing and interviewing in the midst of the largest layoffs in tech history. I think we're gonna crest a quarter of a million people in tech laid off, which is just a crazy number this year. I think the only thing that really matters is accountability and ownership. If you haven't been successful for a really long time, it's gonna be hard for me to justify moving you forward. But if you've had a good career, you had a bad experience at your last role, or you had a couple bad quarters or anything along those lines, I just wanna hear ownership. I wanna hear that you have a clear understanding of why that situation happened. You had a plan to overcome that. You tried it. You know, maybe it did or didn't execute, and now you're moving on. But, again, it's all about accountability and ownership. So it's funny because I've had people that left just because they were ready to move on. But the story was the company was a mess, and they didn't know what they were doing. And then they start pointing fingers. And that to me is an immediate red flag. And I had people that might have been tipped out, and they'll open it up and just say, hey. I didn't perform well the last three months, and here's exactly why. And here's what I'm gonna do to fix it moving forward. When I hear that kind of accountability, that to me translate to someone that's gonna own the sales process. They're gonna own their own development. They're gonna own their growth, and they're gonna be successful. Adam, one of the things that you mentioned in your top three actionable takeaways was creating a two way dialogue where you're putting the interviewer in the hot seat also, and you're asking them hard questions. And I'm curious. We've talked a lot about how you should be responding to these questions with your things in threes and the taking accountability. At what point in the interview? Let's forget about how I ask the hard questions, but at what point should I start to turn questions back on the interviewer? Because my guess is you're a little off put if they start smacking you with tough questions in the first two minutes. Yeah. I can only speak to, like, my process. Right? And I'm interviewing salespeople for a sales role that sells to sales leaders. So, like, what I appreciate might not be the same for, like, someone selling to IT, but there's a bit of, like, aggressiveness that I think sometimes it takes me back, but I'm impressed to see. So the first thing I'll say is I don't know if it's necessarily ever too early. I definitely think that you should sit back and, like, let the interviewer run their process. But if you have questions in what I've seen the best people do, just say, hey. I have a question about it. Should I jot it down, or do you mind if I ask it now? Because Kendall is the person that runs a ton of interviews. Sometimes it's nice ten minutes in to be like, no. Like, I'd love to hear your question. Let's kinda make it a two way street. So I would ask for permission on that. But definitely don't be afraid to write it down and bring it up later. Adam, I wanna press on the previous point of being transparent if you were underperforming, for example. And if I just play the role of a rep who might be in that position interviewing today, There are a lot of sellers who are being laid off, let go because companies are going under and all of these other things. And it's very unlike eighteen months ago when if you're looking for a job, even if you're a middle performer, you might be the best person that that company is looking at. If you're an underperformer, you're probably competing against other top performers now in an interviewer process. And my concern as a rep would be, shoot. If I tell people that I only got to 60% of quota in my last job, why in the world would they pick the 60% of quota person? Aren't I better off just not talking about that at all and avoiding the performance conversation or even possibly lying and say I did well or at least average instead of drawing attention towards my underperformance. That's what I would imagine a rep in that situation would be thinking. How do you think about that? I think any good interviewer is going to get to that information, whether it's on the call itself, whether it's on the reference check. At some point, we're gonna want clarity around that. So I think it's something that you need to address, is my opinion. I also operate, and I think that being honest is the right thing to do. I know that it's let's talk about action here, not about fluffy things. But I think you should have a clear conscience. In sales, you need good karma. You need good juju on your side. So look. It's been a crazy, crazy eighteen ish months, and a lot of very good sellers are on the market right now. A lot of good sellers didn't perform, and it it wasn't a 100% under their control. The market shifted. Everything was just completely in flux. Businesses have shifted on belly up. If I was in the position of, hey, I was at 60%, and I was part of a massive riff, number one, own it. Number two, it's funny. There's a line someone said to me. I was part of a riff, but I have to be transparent. I probably could have survived. And I can tell you what I wish I did differently. It's just so impressive when you have that level of ownership. And the third thing is individuals that that have been performance managed out or maybe haven't achieved the glorified numbers that you put in your LinkedIn profile, have someone on deck ready to talk to that person that's, like, willing to go to bat for you. So, hey. Look. I was only at 60%, and, you know, and I wanted to discuss that. And here are the reasons why. The other thing I wanna note, my manager at the time will go to bat for how hard I worked and will tell you everything that I did and will tell you that they'd probably hire me back in a second. I'll send you their information after this call. I'll include it in my follow-up. But, again, it's having social proof, and I think that's a huge factor as well. That's a killer talk track there. I really love that. I actually wanna press on that talk track even further. You talked about reasons why someone didn't perform and things they would have done differently. What are things that you would like to hear? If I'm a rep interviewing with you, Adam, and I'm like, I didn't do so hot, what are good reasons that I didn't do so hot, and what are good things that I wish I had done differently? I think a bad thing that I wish I had done differently is, yeah, I wish I had pushed to be moved to a different team because mine was a mess, and the other team did really well. What are the things you're hoping to hear? Because so much of this is how you position and tell the story. Yeah. What I would like to hear is just any sort of thoughtful approach that utilizes data and utilizes the mentality that, like, marginally, I could improve. And an example of that would be, you know, hey. It's 60%. Well, I sat down with my manager, and I ran the numbers. And I was slightly under the top performers when it came to self source pipeline. My middle of the funnel was pretty weak, and I lost one really big deal that I probably could have closed if I ran a tighter timeline. So what I did moving forward was actually partnered with our top performing SDR, and we had rolling one on ones. The second thing I did was to clean up that middle of funnel was I actually extended our deal reviews fifteen minutes with my manager, and I made sure to talk about middle of funnel deals. And then regarding that last deal that pushed, I've actually really, really dug into Medic and adopted a very deep approach of Medic on my deals. And that way, it doesn't happen again. So, again, that's kind of like shooting off the cuff, but, like, that type of very clear and concise breakdown. I've heard people do similar things, and it takes something that's negative. And I'm like, holy crap. This might be a diamond in the rough. So, Adam, we've talked a lot about the qualification questions of an interview, your quota attainment, why you're leaving, tell me about yourself, walk me through your resume. Eventually, we start to get into actual sales questions. In other words, how do you sell? How do you run a discovery call? How do you open up your calls? How do you drive timeline? Things like that. I'm curious. We can't go through every question under the sun, but I have asked reps simple questions like, how do you run a discovery call and gotten a seventy minute monologue. And I'm curious, is there a magic formula or a way that I, as an interviewee, should think about answering questions about my sales process in a way that is clear, concise, and compelling? Yeah. I think first and foremost, directionally, you shouldn't be blindsided at all. One of the first things I talked about was have a champion in that the recruiter and then the hiring manager, and they should tell you these are the types of questions you should be prepared for, and this is what you should have. So we ask a lot about process. A big part of my team is they build their own pipeline. They're commercial sales org. So they're out there prospecting like lunatics. Well, I'm gonna ask every single person, what is your process for managing building pipeline while also managing deals that are in flight? So have process related questions. I don't think it needs to be, like, a super sophisticated answer. Speak concisely. Word economy is really important. So when you think about your process, it's not gonna be a long form podcast. It's gonna be, here's exactly how I break down my day. Here's the things that I need to do. Or when I have a discovery call, here are the three things I do to prep. Here are the five things I wanna leave that call with, and then here's the one thing I make sure I do when I follow-up. You gotta be concise. If I could just double down on that, what Adam just rattled off is oftentimes what I want the first answer to be from an interviewee. If I'm asking you, how do you structure a discovery call? I wanna know a high level understanding of step one agenda, step two, high level discovery questions, step three, impact questions, step four, next steps. I don't need to know all of the details of every example of discovery question you could possibly ask, but I wanna know the big buckets. And so what I will oftentimes do as an interviewee or I've seen other interviewees do to me as the interviewer is they've said, I'm gonna give you a thirty second, sixty second overview of my process. Tell me where you'd like me to elaborate. Here's step one, two, three, and four. Is there one place you'd like me to give more detail? And we show that level of control over an interview and control of answering the question and understanding that you might not wanna demo the whole feature, you wanna give the harbor tour and let the prospect ask questions, you're starting to seed how you would also control a sales conversation without rambling for days and days and days. And that's exactly what you just did there, Adam. Yeah. I mean, it's so smart. What you're doing is you're sort of pulse checking of, like, hey. I'm gonna give you the high altitude answer. Know that I could go way, way deeper. And it's sort of similar to what you mentioned earlier, Adam, about asking permission to ask those questions mid interview because you don't always know where the interviewer is and where their head is at. And when you do those little pulse checks of, like, hey. I think you want me to, like, give the high level, but just in case you were looking for the long monologue, I can give that too. I don't want you to think that I only have this shallow answer. It's very, very smart. I wanna go to what you were talking about in the beginning of the actionable takeaways, which was prepping these unique, hard questions for the interviewer. And I'm wondering if you can elaborate on that a little bit. Yeah. So I think first and foremost, you should have a lot of time to ask questions. I try to give people at least ten minutes on a forty five minute interview. And what I'll typically do is give fifteen minutes and then utilize the back end for next steps. So it's an opportunity for you to ask questions. But in my opinion, it's an opportunity for you to be unique, for you to stand out, and for you to showcase that you can think critically, right, about a business. And the last thing that I'll add, committing to a job is a huge, huge thing for an individual. This is your opportunity to suss out risk. So be prepared with questions that might put someone in the hot seat. And when I think about the best ones that have been asked to me, one of them is what's one thing you'd change about Gong? Or what's one thing you'd change throughout the sales process? That put me in the hot seat of, like, I don't necessarily wanna lead and say, like, I don't love these things. But it made me think about what is an area of the business that I would change. And that led to a really good conversation about, like, why don't you think they're doing that today, or why wouldn't the business do that? And I left that conversation to be like, this person has a really good business find. Another one and people sometimes ask, you know, why is the spot open? The reason I don't love that question is because people can get promoted. Someone could have just left for whatever reason. It's kind of an easy out. I would ask, why is the bottom performer on your team currently struggling? And then from there, it's a long tail. Okay. Cool. And, like, how have you tried to help them? And And what is your plan moving forward? Like, what happens if that person doesn't necessarily improve in that area? Like, run discovery on that because that'll allow you to get an understanding of how does a manager deal with someone that needs improvement? And does that align with how you like to be coached and how you like to be managed? That's another one. And the third one that I'll point to, people always ask, are you gonna move me forward to the next round? And you're very seldom gonna get the answer that you want. It's usually gonna be, hey, we gotta circle the wagons at the end of the week. We gotta look at all the candidates. We gotta read all the reviews. We'll reach out to you on Friday. That's like a typical normal answer, something along those lines. I would ask, if you had to point to one reason, you wouldn't move me forward in the process, what would it be? And what that does is it puts the interviewer on the hot seat of, like, okay, I gotta pick out one thing. And I'll be upfront when I'm interviewing someone. I find a bunch of great things. I find a bunch of okay things. I typically find a few beige red flags. I'd bring it up. I would tell you directly. Okay, cool. Here's, like, the one thing that's kinda holding me back. And then you'll have an opportunity to objection handle and or quickly fire that follow-up email. Right? Hey. The one thing you said might hold you back is a b c. We'll put in some proof there as to why that shouldn't be a concern. So you were telling me in the prep for this that part of the reason you want your interviewee to put you in the hot seat is you want them to show that they have some of that natural aggression to feel okay pushing the other person a little bit. And they're also having an opportunity to start to sauce out risk related to this role that, hopefully, they're going to be offered. What should I be doing as a candidate if I get to this point and I'm like, I don't think I should even be sussing out risk yet because I don't think Adam's really sold on me yet? So what are things I should be thinking about doing maybe in that back half of the interview if I'm like, this is going alright, but, like, I really need to tip the odds in my favor before I press on the risk related to the role? Yeah. I think that you bring up a really good point in that it's not natural to, like, start poking into the role if if they're not a a believer in you. I think that you still should have that equal business stature and still have that aggression or that bullishness on yourself. But you should dig in instead of the business. You should dig into that interview and how they feel about you. And I'll tell you, a huge part of sales is, like, reading the room and understanding what's happening back and forth. That's a huge part of interviewing. It's usually pretty obvious when we hit a little bit of a rough patch. When it's your turn to ask questions, it's like, hey. Can I address the elephant in the room? When you asked about a, b, and c, it felt like my answer didn't really resonate. I'd love to understand, like, do you see that as a bit of a red flag? Like, look, what are your thoughts on that? That? Get there. And then, again, I would have some sort of, like, transition, like, hey. Okay. Cool. And generally speaking, does it feel like I'd be a fit for the role? Okay. Cool. Boom. Now we can go into talking about the actual role. So I never thought of it that way, Nick, but that's a great breakdown. Like, first, let's talk about myself and make sure that we have a green light, then let's talk about the actual role itself. It's almost like talking about timeline and and discounts. It's like, I don't even know if you want this yet. What Adam is doing is similar to the concept of breaking the third wall in acting. In other words, oftentimes, there's this fake transparent wall that sits between someone who wants a job and someone who has a job to offer. And they both have questions in the back of their mind and objections in the back of their mind. But for one reason or another, they're not actually comfortable sharing them. And what happens when you punch through that wall of transparency, you actually get your interviewer to open up as a real human as well. I remember the first ever sales interview I bombed. It was actually for Drift, funny enough. And he ripped me apart on a mock discovery. And at the end of it, I was like, look. That was one of the worst sales calls I ever run. If I was running this differently, I know I'm probably not gonna get another chance at it. Here are the four or five things that I should have done better. And I took the words out of his mouth, and you could see he just sort of eased his foot off the gas pedal as he was getting ready to give me all this feedback. And next thing you know, he actually passed me to the next step. And the person in the first round of the on sites was like, someone told me that you seem like a really, really hard worker that cared about your own development. And it's because I did that thing to break the third wall. So I love how you talk about that, man. Another place that you talked about doing that is after the interview. Can you talk about interview closes? Minutes are going by. I'm punching my one, two, three, four rating on this candidate. What should I be doing as an interviewee to make sure that it's either a three or a four? So first and foremost, the speed of you sending out that follow-up email is so important. And I talked earlier about being an EMT. The golden hour is a huge thing. If you get a patient back from the incident to the hospital in an hour, the chance of survival go through the roof. Well, think of it like that. The golden hour, as soon as that interview ends, and I would probably say half an hour. Fire off that follow-up. Make sure it's thoughtful. And look, I don't wanna get too in the weeds tactically, but you should be blocking the thirty minutes after an interview to do these things. You don't wanna roll right into a sales call or something else that you have to do. That's the first thing. The second thing is you should be already connected with them on LinkedIn. You should have sent that days ago. Message them right away. Hit them on the multiple mediums. And then tying back to the first thing that I said about building a champion, you should be texting and or calling the champions you have, which if you're talking to the hiring manager, it's through the recruiter. Texting or calling them. Give them a really quick brief. I thought it went well. Here are the things that went well. But here is where I have concern. I would love any direction that you have. And I promise you that recruiter, who's incentivized to move you down the funnel, if they sourced you, will reach out to the hiring manager and say, how did it go? And they'll get an inside scoop. So the three breakdown there, it's fast follow-up as soon as possible. Send that thank you note. Second thing is you should be connected on LinkedIn. Send them another ping. And then last but not least, reach out to your champions, your recruiter, and so on, and give them the loadout. Adam, thank you for meeting with me today. I look forward to hearing next steps. I'm curious. There's a question for both of you guys. What does a great follow-up email look like to that interview? What should be included? I think the most important thing is you wanna do two things. You wanna be unique because you have to stand out, and you wanna prove that you're actively listening. So the be unique part is harder to coach on, but be yourself. The active listening part, though, put in the things that were, like, important to you that you thought were relevant. Hey. I loved how you talked about Gong's go to market strategy moving forward as x y z, and the things you're excited about are those two new product launches. That's really awesome to me. And that makes me further excited because a b c. Right? Because I did that already at my previous company. So something that shows active listening. If there was any sort of red flag that was discussed, address that as well. And I'll give you an example. Oftentimes, people that I interview, I get nervous that they may not be as bullish on prospecting as they need to be to be successful in my role. A lot of people will send me, hey. Here's an example of a few of my best cold emails, and I'll have screenshots in there. Or you can do that in two minutes. It doesn't take that long. Right? Or a shout out they got on LinkedIn for incredible prospecting. Or it could be a shout out they got on Slack for being the top performer for booking opportunities that month. So you can put some social proof. And if you're really good, you're gonna align that to red flags and and beige flags that they called out in the interview. So when you ask, like, what does a really good follow-up email sound like? It's original and authentic. It's gonna be concise, and it's gonna show your active listening, and it's also gonna help you overcome some objections you might have heard. Dude, that's so brilliant. And I would implore if you're listening to this episode and if you're not looking for a sales job, start keeping a file today of all of those greatest hits. The awesome shout out from your manager, the really, really great creative prospect email that booked you a meeting with the CEO, etcetera, etcetera. So then as you get deeper into your career, you can point to this awesome swipe file of how amazing you are. And speaking of amazing, you're amazing, Adam, but we're running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question. And so the final question is this. We've talked a lot about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing when they're interviewing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so my last question is, what is one bad behavior that you see folks exhibiting when they're doing these interviews or in the interview process that you think they need to break because it's hurting them more than it helps? I think it is the need to describe everything, the need to be long winded and not be concise. And Arman and I both kind of touched on it multiple times. Do not be afraid to be concise. Do not be afraid to be almost a little bit vague, and give people the opportunity to unpack the answers further. Long winded answers are the bane of my existence, and I'm sure I'm not alone. We think very quickly, so be very concise with your answers. Amazing. Adam, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode with Adam Ochart is number one, be concise when answering questions. Word economy matters. It's alright to give the four bullets of an answer, and then let the interviewer know that you can go deeper on things if they would like you to. Number two is do not neglect the golden hour. It's really the golden thirty minutes, like Adam said. What you should be doing is post interview, sending out a follow-up thank you that is creative and shares how you could be great with the recruiter and the interviewer. One tip is to pre draft this so you have it ready to hit send very quickly. Number three, going into your interview. Never be surprised. Get the cheat code questions to the interview from your recruiter and your interviewer. If you are hearing surprise questions and you had no idea this was gonna be the topic, that's probably your fault. And lastly, number four, if you have the unfortunate circumstances of possibly going through a rift, that is okay. It happens to everyone. It's happened to me. Hit adversity head on. Tell them, hey. If I were to survive, maybe I could have, here's how I would have done it instead. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? Well, if you've not sent Adam Ochart a message on LinkedIn saying thank you. Thank you. Thank you for this amazing interview, it would mean a lot to Adam and, actually, to us if you would thank our wonderful guest. He took a lot of time out of his day to prep for this. He literally had a forecast call right after this, and he stayed with us for an amazing interview. So send Adam a thank you note. That's it, and we'll see you next week on the show.
