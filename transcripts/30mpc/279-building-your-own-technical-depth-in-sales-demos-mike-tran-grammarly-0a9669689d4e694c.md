## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigalski. And today, we have the first ever sales engineer episode of thirty minutes to president's club with the one and only Mike Tran from Grammarly. Nick, why should people listen? If you're a salesperson listening to this episode and you're like, I don't have a sales engineer. I'm gonna skip this one. Don't. Because if you don't have a sales engineer, that means you are the sales engineer. So you can do the things that Michael is suggesting. And if you work with a sales engineer, he can also do the stuff he's suggesting. Three, two, one. You should listen to this episode. Alright, Michael. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Number one, the importance of clearly painting the current before and without state. And I can't overemphasize this enough. Too often, we hop into directly what life looks like with our product, how much life is better with our product, but that doesn't really connect with the customer. So for example, with Grammarly, you know, if we hop into a document and we're correcting, you know, making a sentence more clear, improving the tone, sure, that's exciting as a feature, but really what we have to do is say, think about how long it would take for someone to, like, even start writing this document. How painful it'd be? How hard it is for someone to put together a comprehensive document when they're both focusing on the content that they're working on and, like, grammatical structure. Right? So once we paint that, we really bring people back into the moment. And then when we talk about how much better life is later, it really connects with them. Beautiful. What's number two? Number two. Linking back to the person who mentioned the problem and the pain. And what I mean here is whether it's in demoing or discovery, when we're on a call, we really gotta first listen, obviously, listen to what people are saying. I take notes of that. And later in the call, I'll give you an example. Maybe we're on a call, and Elaine mentions, oh, my colleagues are really not good at being clear and concise. They're really wordy, and it makes it hard for us to collaborate. Later on, when I show the product and I show how Grammarly helps with clarity and concise, as I say, Elaine, I know you mentioned that you have a couple teammates that have trouble with brevity. This is how Grammarly helps with that. And what that does is it shows, one, that we're listening, and two, it brings your trust to this. Right? Because now it's not just this pain that we're talking about. It's a pain that Elaine specifically mentioned that she feels every day. Woo. Giller, round us out. What's number three? Number three, preempt customer concerns. I think this is so huge. And at Grammarly, really, one of the biggest concerns we have and we hear from customers is around security and privacy. And that's because we do handle what people write, and and we work in the majority of places people are working, and there can be a lot of private information. So when we're on a call with a head of security, an IT team, a security team, even before they ask a question, I just start with, we understand that security and privacy is a concern. And because of that, we take the utmost care with your data, with privacy, and we operate to the highest security standards. And what that does is it shows the customer that we, one, we understand, and two, we're already thinking about and solving the problem. And it just builds a lot of trust. And then they're like, great. Sounds like that's a great start. Obviously, we'd still need to see documentation, but instead of starting on a back split where they're like, oh, we don't trust you, and then having to answer their questions from that perspective. Perspective. So for everyone who has not worked with a sales engineer before, one, congrats to Mike Tran because he's the first ever SE interview on 30. But then, two, what a sales engineer does or solutions consultant, call that other companies, is they're essentially product and technical experts, and they are a jackknife that assists the AE who's oftentimes quarterbacking deals. What that means is if there's a technical demo to run, especially at companies that have multiple complex products, you cannot possibly know all of those things as an AE or get in the same level of technical depth as an SE. So you might have an SE run a technical demo. You might have them scope a technical deal for you. You might have them even help you build a business case or handle a security review. So they're really an extension of the AE from a product and technical expertise lens. So, Mike, on that basis, one of the things that I imagine both a new SE and, frankly, AE struggle with is you talked about preempting the concern around security, which is getting in front of it, talking about the things you know they're gonna be worried about. But I imagine there's a fine line to be walked as an SE, which is whenever you're demoing a feature or explaining something, you also don't want to go through the 17 steps and all of the back end architecture if you don't need to because you will bore people to death and also possibly provoke more objections than not. So how do you draw the line between being overly technical versus speaking in generalities that are like, wait. This person is not giving me enough information. Yeah. I think that question comes up more, I think, when we're in the actual demo and someone asked, like, how does this security feature work, or how is your ML model work? Right? And I think it sounds cliche, but it's really about doing your research and listening throughout this whole conversation. Right? So I think one of the things that I require as we work on demos and even if it's already a demo call we prep for, we already did a disco call before, is to do fifteen minutes of disco on that latest call. Right? So that we can get a really good feel for the room. We can hear things. Right? And once we have that, we can really set a baseline for what do people actually wanna hear in this conversation? What is their level of technical expertise? Right? And that's why that, like, I call pre disco for a demo is so, so important. It sets the tone for the whole conversation, allows us to link back to what people are saying, but also understand the level of detail and what matters to them. Can you talk about what is different, and how do you make the SE DISCO nonduplicative with the AE discovery call that just happened before? It's a great question. And I think the truth is it's okay if we repeat some of the same things. The great thing about bringing a new face is I can be a little bit of that. I'm the new guy. I don't know. I haven't heard everything. You know, I had some prep, but I haven't heard it from them. Right? I wanna get to know them. And we can make it personal that way also where I say, you know, I know you may have mentioned some of this already on the last call, but I think it is important for us to just hear it again and maybe go a little bit more detail and kind of build that trust with them again. What you were telling me on the pre call when we were prepping for this is what you'll do is you'll have, like, a, hey. Here's what we heard slide, or you'll do a recap of, hey. I synced up with Arma and the AE, and these were the big sort of themes that I heard, but I'm hoping you can fill in some color here. What you're doing is you're not like, so tell me about your priorities. I know nothing about you. You're saying, hey. I I sort of synced with Armand. I got some stuff. And what this accomplishes is it shows, hey. You're in sync with your team. And two, it brings them back to that pain they talked about before and reorients them around that tough emotional space of the pain they're dealing with so that when you show that demo, it's all the more real. I actually wanna figure out, like, how the heck are you actually syncing with your AE on this? What sort of backdrop are you collecting from them to make sure that the call is going to be effective knowing that, yeah, you could probably go listen to the recording, but I don't think you got time for that. I think there are a few key areas I think are super important. The basics, obviously. This one is so obvious, but who are we working with? Right? Who's your main point of contact? What is the scope of this, you know, engagement? Is it just for the customer support team? Is it for the support team and the marketing team and the legal team and the finance team? Really need to understand the scope. And then we also need to understand what is the pain. But not just, like, oh, what do they wanna solve, but what is the pain. Right? Not just, oh, they want the team to write better. That's not a pain. Right? Obviously, Grammarly helps people write better. The pain is the team's not communicating effectively. It's slowing us down. We're not getting x y z done. Right? So I really push them to get us to that. Can you talk about what that pushing looks like? Because my guess is there's times when you get a demo put on your calendar for next Thursday, and the pain is written. They're excited to get to write better. What's that conversation look like with the AE where you push on them? And then how do they actually go back to the customer to go get some pain that you can demo on? So that happens sometimes. It happens less and less often because the AUs I work with are great. But if that does happen, I'll ask them, okay. Let's at least think about, like, what the pain might be. Let's at least hypothesize on what this pain might be. And then from there, what we can do is we can go back to the customer and ask for some specific examples of things. Right? So if we're working with a support team, I might say, we have an NDA in place. We're gonna have a demo next week. We want it be to be really impactful for your team. Can you share with us some examples of emails that have went out that weren't great? Can you share examples of the training materials you use for the team, the writing guidelines? And in there, we can kind of embed little questions also. Like, oh, is this the area that creates a lot of issues for the team, or is it this area that creates a lot of issues and kind of dive gently that way? I appreciate you even sharing just, like, the basic prep stuff that you're asking to get from the AE because I have worked with SEs who complained to me for days on end about the AEs who said, yeah. Just show them a demo. And I never did that. I promise. But, gosh, if you're an AE who is not prepping your SE, please do. I wanna talk to you around sort of two questions. They're actually connected. One is, I imagine, Michael, when you have a new AE who joins your team, there's some sort of, like, sync where you're setting some ground rules for how they should engage with you and the roles that you should play on on a call because I bet the AE should be behaving differently than you, and you wanna know that in advance. I guess, could you talk to me around, like, what are some of those ground rules and predetermined stuff that you're syncing with your AEs on? So I think for calls, the way we generally set them, and I think it is super effective, is having the AE generally kick these calls off and and kind of bring everyone into the room because I might be a new face. There might be other new faces in the room. Then the AE is gonna set the goal for the call as well as setting up the backdrop. Right? Both the goal and what's happened previously. And then that's where I come in and the SE comes in to go deeper on that. Right? So once the backdrop's set, that's, you know, where we can start that disco again. And from there, the SE runs through, I think, the majority of the demo, but I think the best demos are the ones where the AEs get involved as well. Right? I think customers really respect that, actually. And I think I may be demoing something, and one of my AEs and some of the best ones, you know, they find the right moment to say, oh, you know, with another customer we work with, this happens, and then I can show them something as well. And that's obviously a cadence that takes some work. Right? But I think a demo where only the SE is talking or only the SE and the customer is talking is to me not the a plus demo. The a plus demo has everyone in the room talking. And then they generally handles next steps unless they're technical or or security related next steps and then the SE YIELD act part of it. Are there moments during the SE talk tracker, moments during your demo where you'll pause? Or if I'm an AE, are there certain times that I can look for where I should be jumping in? Because I've seen it go really awkwardly sometimes where my SE will pause, and I'm like, rep, that's your moment, and they miss it. Or there are times where the rep will jump in, and the SE would be like, dude, I was literally about to say that. So how do I avoid stepping on each other's toes? I think the first thing is about getting comfortable about it's okay to step on it a little bit maybe. Right? I think when someone's like, oh, I was about to say that. I think that's the wrong way to work. That's, like, the wrong way to feel about it. We should be working really in harmony as a team. Right? Everyone wins. Right? Like, we're working together here to make Grammarly successful. And I think we have to first get out of that mindset where we're who should be saying what? Once you're out of that mindset, the flow happens so naturally. It's like any other conversation. Right? We're talking to customers, and we're talking to friends and new people every day. I think everyone can figure that out. I think it's about getting out of that mindset. In one of those meetings, is there any game planning behind the scenes or on a sec break communication channel that you're doing? And if so, can you talk to me about it? Yeah. Definitely. I think the way we get out of that mindset is the preplanning. So when we're going through the preplanning of the demo, we walk through the framework. I let my AEs know, hey. If I forget something here, hop in. Right? And so I think that's where we open that bridge, and then we're both really comfortable. So, Nick, I I really appreciate you asking that. I just let them know ahead of time. Let's hop in any point. You know the full talk track. I may get 90% of it, but I need the extra help gain that last 10%, and it just works better. The two things that I'll give you is one of them, Mike actually already gave us an example. If if you're just starting out as an AE, the easiest thing you can do is take what you learned in discovery and link that back to the demo that Mike is doing. And, of course, Mike is going to be saying, oh, Leanne, you mentioned x y z earlier on this call. But the reality is as the AE, you have thirty, sixty, sometimes ninety minutes of discovery ammunition that your SE doesn't have. So if your SE is demoing something and they're using the traditional before after state, your job as an AE can be to make it very, very real for the prospect. Similarly, the other advantage that you can have is your SEO is focused on the demo. And if you're in a big room, there might be three, four, or five people in the room, and they can't possibly be super focused on the demo and also looking at five sets of eyeballs. So it's your job to look at people who are disengaged and pull them into the conversation as well. Well, furthermore, Mike's given an whatever, a thirty minute hour long demo. Like, you gotta give him a chance, to take a sip of water or take a breath of air. Like, it's really, really hard to manage. You've got the demo environment. You're looking at your notes. You're having to go through all of your talk tracks. It's hard doing your job. And when you can buy your SE a second to just, like, reorient their mind, it's really, really powerful. I wanna talk about an area where you often do need to reorient your mind, and that's when I'm sure this never happens at your company, but some of the past places I worked at, the demo environment doesn't work. And it's always this awkward moment where it's like, alright. And watch when I click wait. And I always hear people make these lame jokes where it's like, oh, our engineers must be updating the product. We move really fast. How do you handle a situation like that? Probably doesn't happen at Grammarly too much. Well, it does and it doesn't. I'm actually trying to think of a good example. You know, I think these things definitely come up. Right? And, of course, Grammarly's product is amazing, so we never have issues. But, really, the truth is when it comes up, I think it's just about really owning it. Right? Like, as with anything, things happen. People understand that. I think making a joke of it is not what people will respect. I think often it's more like, oh, sorry. We'll just take a moment. You know, we'll reset this, and and it'll be fine. I think just owning that, sometimes things don't work. That's life. That builds trust with the customer as well. Mike, one of the things to the point of where things can go wrong that I've seen makes the difference between a great SE and an okay SE is you have the benefit of being technical, but that does not mean that you should answer every single technical question. So my guess is you get people who are super, super sophisticated. Technically, maybe they're very below the line, and they get into this train of, can you do this? Can you do this? Right? And you get the sense that they're bringing you down this checklist, and you're basically becoming a glorified Wikipedia for your product. So when you get the sense that that is happening, how do you stop the bleeding on that? It's always exciting when people are excited even if it's about a checklist. Right? And so I think it's kind of a leading into that, but not in that moment. So often, I'll say, love how, like, excited you are about the product, the things you wanna learn. I think today's call is about x, y, and z. Be happy to set up a separate time for us to connect with just yourself or the larger group. And, again, we're personalizing it. We're making sure they feel heard, but also that we have a clear goal for this current moment and call. So we've actually never talked about that next call where you've got Armand, who's this technical wizard who wants to know about all of the back end architecture and clicks and permissions, and he's not at all thinking about the problem, the pain, the gap, and where what you sell can take his business. How do you actually execute on you get on that Zoom with Armand, who's got his notepad with 432 questions for you. How do you run that call so that it's not just a stump the chump fest? Yeah. Before those calls, we provide people with access to Grammarly, right, and Grammarly business. So they can really use the product and love it. Like, it's a great product. It works so well. So that's the first step. And then the second step is, like, just doing a little disco. I think disco, it's, like, so cliche, but I cannot overemphasize the importance of discovery. Like, even in that moment when he has a clear agenda of going through his list, asking him about, you know, how was your experience with Bramble? How did you feel about that? Where did it help you the most? Right? That gives us a a chance to understand, you know, where his pain is gonna be and where we can go a little bit deeper. On this note, you said you put the product in their hands. How do you draw the line between you're sort of like a sliding scale. You could do a customized demo for someone to make it feel real, then you could give them, like, a tour portal to make it feel even more real. That That might evoke more objections. Or you can go all the way in and do a POC for a deal. How do you figure out which of those paths is appropriate for any given deal? Yeah. I think the way we think about it is, generally, each of these steps takes time and can potentially slow down the deal. Right? And so we look at them often as gates. Like, a POC only happens if we can't sell the deal without a POC. So that that's kind of that gate for the POC. You know, putting it in someone's hands, that's a maybe a a trickier and softer area to evaluate. Right? It's do we think it's gonna help them? Do we think they're gonna get value out of it? I think generally, yes. And there's also some guidance there. I think it's really important to preempt people the value they're gonna get before you put it in their hands. Right? Like, if I'm gonna give it to Arman, before I give it to Arman, I go, Arman, I'm gonna give you, you know, one week access to grab my business. You know, what people see is it really helps them save time and improve the quality of the right. Even if it's something small like that, I think it really helps to not just put something in someone's hand, but, like, preempt them again on what the value is they're going to receive from that. How much guidance or instruction do you give them going into a POC or even using a tour portal as to what they should be doing or what they should be looking out for? Or do you just, like, give them the tour portal and they're like, figure it out. Have fun. So I think with the product, if they're gonna have it for a week, we give them a lot of examples of where it'll help them. You know, we know that, Arman, you're in sales. You work on SOW. They'll help you there. You work on emails. They'll help you there. You work on call notes. They'll help you there. So giving them some outline of of where they'll be using it, where it'll help them. In the POC, we really hold their hand. I really think it's about controlling the narrative or maybe not controlling, but guiding the narrative. Right? So there, we have whole plans on how do you launch to users? What is the communication plan? What is the enablement plan? Right? What is the configuration plan even before all of that? Right? So we really wanna handle them because they should look at this product and be like it's a no brainer. One, it works almost perfectly out of the box even though we've invested so much time in handling and making sure that everyone has the perfect experience. Okay. So I have been part of POCs that haven't gone too hot. And, usually, the first impression is where it starts not being too hot, where I get an email out of the blue with credentials, and I scratch my head, and I say, I well, hey. This. Talk to me about the intentional motion around launch through enablement to make sure that you have guardrails around making sure that they say, wow. This POC is a foreshadow of what rollout's gonna be. We should do this thing. Yeah. With launch, I think that's exactly the issue we've ran into at the beginning. When we ran our first EOC three years ago, that was exactly the issue. Users get an email with credentials, and they're like, I have no idea what I'm going to do with this. Now we have a full email sequence that we share with our champion or the program manager who's managing the POC. They'll send out to their users ahead of getting an invite. And we may not even do invites. We just may have a walk through of what they need to do. Right? That way, it's really personal. And that walks them through not only how to log in, how to configure what they need, how to get started, but, really, most importantly, focusing them on on why are they getting the product and what is the value. So for example, if we're working with a support team, the support team will get a note and the note might, you know, walk them through how to set it up. And then it'll say, you know, the reason that you're getting this actually is so that you help you with, you know, your customer communication so that you're more efficient, that you can work a little bit faster, and also that it'll help you improve the quality and consistency of your customer communication to our brand guidelines. And I think there's this beauty of preempting people to what they're going to experience that just opens them up to the experience and makes them so much more effective at using the tool. So for the POC, we always talk about having really well defined groups because well defined groups have well defined problems, and that means we can solve those problems. Now we are happy to open up to multiple different groups. We're happy to open up to the legal team and to the marketing team and to the support team, but, really, it's important to have really clearly defined groups there. And then as far as timing, Grammarly, if you used it, is a tool I hopefully, many of the listeners have used it. It's a tool that's really easy to use, and we do enablement also. We do enablement sessions, you know, webinars, is that your team will be up and running fully in two weeks. They'll fully know how to use Grammarly in two weeks. Then we give them another runway of two to three weeks of using it. And so between four and six weeks, we wanna cut that off, keep the conversation moving. And I think that's really important because the longer you run things, the less excited people are about things. Right? The less the top of mind it is. And, you know, we all know, like, the more time you spend on something, that just kills deals. Right? So we think the perfect point for us is about four to six weeks. We do enablement sessions, which are webinars. We usually host between two and three just to ensure that users can see how to use the product, understand, and ask any questions they have. We usually have recordings of that they can share with the rest of the team as well. And the other touch point we have with the users usually happens near the end. Around week four, we do a survey to ask them about their experience, and this is actually where we get a lot of insightful feedback. Usually, it's quite positive, but we also ask them about how much does it help them in their work? Where does it help them? Right? How much time are they saving? So we do have that touch point as well. And then one other area, not to overemphasize this, but I think the more touches I think we have with both the users and the champion, the better. My kickoff for every single call with the champion is have you heard anything from your team about Grammarly? That's the first thing. I want that feedback every single call. That's how we kick it off. When you're doing this POC, you're using the word we. Is it you who's doing this? Is it the AE AE who's doing this? I wanna understand how you're splitting up those roles. Yeah. So when we do a POC, it kinda ranges depending on the scale, but at the very minimum, the AE and the SE is on every call. I tell the AEs that this is a great chance for them to get closer with their champion. Right? Like, when do you get a call every single week with both your champion and others scheduled so you have to be there? For some larger POCs, we'll bring in even a customer success manager and an implementation specialist also early on and towards the end just to really have a smooth process. But, really, it's primarily run by the AE and the SE. Before we even kick off a POC as part of the requirement, come it's a fool's errand to start a POC without a success criteria, and it can differ depending on the company. Sometimes the success criteria is as simple as users are adopting it. 90% of users are up and running, and 80% of them wanna continue using the product. Sometimes it's that simple. Right? Other times, it's they need to be using it and correcting x number of suggestions a day, and average handle times need to be down by this much. But the way I think about it is we just need to set them ahead of time. I care less a little bit about what they are as long as we know we influence them. If we're gonna influence those areas of success, whatever they are, we're happy to work with that. Can you talk to me about this exit criteria, these success metrics? I imagine a lot of the times, they set success criteria that you're like, oh, we're gonna knock that out of the park because you make such a great impact. And then it's also if they set it way too high, you're like, okay. Hold up. We need to scale back. What do you do if it's, like, just out of reach? Do you try to reset them? What's your approach when you're not crazy about their success criteria? Yeah. I think there's two categories. I think the one where it's the area that we impact, but maybe it's a little too far, like, they're like, we wanna cut our average handle times by 70%. That seems way too high. Right? I think those, we can just be realistic about what we can do. If it's close, let's say they want 25%, but we're 20, we can say, if really you need 25%, this is what the ROI actually looks like for you. Right? That's, like, 50 x ROI. Even at 20%, we're still at forty, thirty five x ROI, and then that kinda helps bring them back. The other area is if they're asking about things that we just don't do, the truth is that's a great way of qualifying things out. Right? That just means if we're not gonna solve the problem, we just should qualify it out at that point. And I think that's a good thing because often, I think we say, you know, the second best answer to yes is no versus maybe. Mike, this has been a wonderful episode. But sadly, we are running out of time, so we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things that salespeople and SEs should be doing, but now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the final question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople or SEs exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? I think the number one thing is not disqualifying things out soon enough. I think our time is our most valuable asset, and too much time, whether it's AE or SE time, is spent on deals that aren't fruitful because we have sparkly eyes or we're just holding on. I think the best thing we can do is qualify those out, spend more time. That's how we're able to spend time running three webinars for a POC. Right? It's because we qualified out deals that aren't going to make it. Pick the deals you're gonna win, win the deals you pick. Mike, thanks for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Mike Tran include number one. If you don't have enough pain going into the demo, you can ask for some documentation that might reveal said pain prior to the demo. Number two, when you're starting the technical demo or the deep dive demo, whether you're an SE or an AE, you should reaffirm what happened in the previous discovery call and then also add on fifteen minutes of your own discovery to properly tailor the demo. Number three, as you demo, don't just demo the before and after state, which is good. Also, demo the before state, the after state, and who said they had the problem in the first place. And then lastly, number four, give your champion an email sequence when you are kicking off a POC that they can use to drive comms internally throughout the POC. Nick, how could people help us out here? Alright. So this one was a master class on how an AE and an SE should be working together. So if you are a salesperson that has an SE, take this episode, copy the link to it, send it to your SE, and get a jam on the calendar for how the two of you can implement this stuff as a team.
