## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Armand Farouk. I'm here with my cohost Nick Sigelski. And today, believe it or not, we have the guest of the first podcast that I ever listened to. The first podcast episode I ever listened to was starring Colin Spector. At the time, he was running sales at Namely leading HRIS platform. And today, he's running sales at Orem HQ. And we're gonna go through some gnarly role plays today. Nick, why should people listen? Colin takes us through best practices from the very first discovery call all the way through dealing with competitors, showing a killer demo, and then negotiating with the customer. Let's check this one out. Three, two, one. A killer show. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright. Colin, welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Awesome. Thanks for having me here, guys. So number one, inoculate common objections. Your competition will be planning landmines when your prospective buyers are speaking with them. So if you're early in the evaluation or even if, you know, you're number two or three, you can bet that your competition has already planted landmines about your services, your product. So if you can get in front of those landmines and and inoculate those potential objections in that conversation early, you're gonna see more success or or at least resonate the message better for those potential buyers. Very nice. What's number two, Colin? Number two, voice mail drops. This is around this is around prospecting. This is around outbound, cold calling, emailing, sequencing, cadences. Include voice mail drops in your outbound sales campaigns. What is a voice mail drop? So voice mail drop is leaving strategic voice mails at different steps in your outbound motion. So if you have, let's say, a 10 step sequence or cadence, dropping a voice mail at least three times referencing other channels that you're hitting them on will help increase the total reply rate we've seen between 510%. So a voice mail drop going in lockstep with an email, a voice mail drop going in lockstep with a LinkedIn, or in some cases, if you're doing direct mail, like on a Sendoso or you're doing, like, a cupcake drop back when we had offices and we're doing those, a voice mail drop asking if they if they had received that that package as well. So highly recommend. Awesome. What's number three, Colin? Number three, open your discovery or your qualification calls with why are we here? Why now? Even if it was scheduled from a cold call. Right? Oftentimes, you get in there. You you, thank them for joining. But understanding why they're willing to invest their time. Time is precious. I'm sure you see it all all the time on LinkedIn. We're competing for attention constantly. Why was that person willing to jump on yet another Zoom call with you to invest some of that time? And even if they're complimenting the the cold outreach and the cold message that you had sent or your STR had sent to to get that scheduled, There is a real reason why they were willing to invest their precious time with you. So always start the conversation there. Hey. I know we reached out to you guys cold. I know my STR did a great job get getting this conversation scheduled. But curious though, why were you willing to meet with us today? Why now? And just those those simple questions starting with why as as you may have heard from other folks can lend to, a successful opening to the rest of the conversation there. So, Colin, I totally agree with you. And I think Nick does the same thing where our first disco question is always, why did you take the call? You don't take every cold call you get. Why are you here? But a lot of people say, tell me about your business priorities. And you're like, who the heck is this guy to even ask me about my business priorities? You just called me out of blue. So could you tell me what happens after that? When people tell you why they took the call, you might be blindsided with something completely different in your disco that you wouldn't expect. Where do you take your disco calls from there? To the point you made, right, you don't always have the best notes leading into those discovery calls or maybe you're going from back to back. Hopefully, you're not doing that. Hopefully, you're always doing the prep work on the person you're speaking with, especially in a a discovery call. But asking them once you figure, hey. Why are we willing to take the call? I mean, you can follow that up with how familiar are you with what we do here at your company, in my case, Orem. So how familiar are you with what what we do here at Orem? Well, to be honest, not not too familiar. I I can't remember why I I took the meeting. That could be something they say in in example like what you're, alluding to. So just understanding, well, hey. And you go in a bit of an introduction into what you guys do, what your product is. In our case, hey. We're a conversation platform. Helps your sales team get more live conversations over the phone. I'm always curious, what are you guys doing today for prospecting? Right? Go into the business process or problem that that you solve for. So get you're starting to uncover what the current state of the union is at that at that company. So start the high level. Hey. What are you guys doing today for, prospecting? You guys doing cold calls, emails, LinkedIn? And, get them talking about their current process, and that can usually open the door to discovering if there's pain they have yet to identify. So I wanna talk about this if there's pain they've yet to identify. One of the things that's tough about asking process questions is they'll say, like, yeah. I have my SDRs find 50 accounts a week. They sequence all the contacts. They do mostly emails. They do some calls here and there just because I'm not the best use of time, and, you know, we're we're a pretty successful team. How do you get me to realize that I have latent pain or unrealized pain without being like, yo. Like, wake up. This this part of your business is on fire, dude. Absolutely. It's a it's a good question. I mean, with with if they're responding with an answer like that, yeah, we're we're seeing success. We're doing some calls. We're doing some emails. We're doing some LinkedIn. We don't do a ton of calls because it it takes a lot of time. The question you got there, I mean, they said that we're successful. Well, I'm curious. I mean, what does success look like for you guys? Is everybody hitting quota today? If they're saying, yeah. Every everything is great. Yeah. We're seeing a ton of success. We do a little bit of call, a little bit of email, a little bit of LinkedIn. Okay. Great. How many reps do you have on the team there? Oh, we've got 20 reps on the team. Oh, okay. And everybody here there's hitting quota? So understanding, like, yeah. If everyone's hitting quota and they're happy with the way things are, you're asking these questions early in the conversation. There might not be pain. There might not be a problem to solve. Right? But if they're saying, yeah, everyone hit quota last year, but my goal just went up 50%, and they're not giving me budget for more headcount. So you wanna figure out, okay. You're you're gathering information. Is it there there's a few levers that they can focus on. Right? It's it's headcount. It's be more efficient with the current reps time. And, again, I'm speaking to the pain that we solve for. You obviously have in each of your respective services the pain you solve for. Gathering all of these bits of information bit by bit is gonna help when you start to go into prescribing potential solutions or or helping them see the gap in the challenge you solve for. I wanna talk about now when we get deeper into the process where maybe you're working in a competitive deal. And one of the things that you mentioned earlier was the landmines planted by the competition. And so I'm hoping you can detail for the listeners, like, what is a landmine? How is our competition planting one? And then what do we actually do it to inoculate against it? Can you voice over, like, how you protect yourself from stepping on something that's gonna blow your deal up? Knowing your competition and knowing the type of objections they bring up to buyers is critical. So as a seller, you should be learning as much about your competition as you know about your own product. You should know oftentimes, you you know, you'll gather that from could be from other Horus calls or Gong calls that you listen to, other AEs. Your enablement team should be taking note of most common objections from each competitor, what your competition has potentially planted. Now if they already spoke with Connect and Sell, and if they mentioned to Connect and Sell, oh, we're gonna look at Orem. I know Connect and Sell is going to say, oh, well, Orem, they can't talk to gatekeepers for you. Or or, they can't get through every directory that we can. So I just get in front of that. Say, okay. Great. Well, you spoke with connect and sell, sound like a great conversation. And they probably told you we don't handle gatekeepers. They probably told you we we don't do a good job getting through every directory that's out there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. They did say that. They did mention that. Yeah. Happy to talk through the pros and cons there. You should understand where your strengths can resonate with them. Right? So, hey, understand. Hey. They probably told you we we don't handle gatekeepers. But I'm curious. What percentage of your data actually go to a gatekeeper? Are you guys mostly calling and talking to receptionists all day? No. I mean, here and there, the guy do receptionist, but we bought we just bought ZoomInfo. Oh, you just bought ZoomInfo. Oh, so you guys probably have direct dials turned on and you're enriching with great data. Right? Absolutely. We just made a huge investment in ZoomInfo. Okay. Great. Well, in that case, you may not need the the gatekeeper service as much as you might think originally. Right? So further uncovering other areas where you can lend a strength. In our case, it's if you have great data, if you have dial by name directories or direct dials, will probably be a a better fit in my opinion. And then, of course, lending to your other strengths. Right? And that could be the type of technology you have, the type of integrations, and that lends into the holistic view of what they're thinking about. So getting an idea of their state of the union of the whole workflow. Well, hey. What other solutions are you guys working with over there? Well, we have Outreach. We have ZoomInfo. We have Lucia. We've got Gong. Okay. Great. Well, we actually plug in directly with all the solutions, and we built Orem as a technology company first and foremost with these integrations in mind. I mean, we're built for the modern seller. So our competition, they're fantastic service providers. They've been in the space twenty, thirty years. We're just a different approach to solving a very serious problem that many, sales organizations face today. So, Colin, I wanna turn the table now. So knowing that we don't wanna trash the competition, what about if you learn something talking to the buyer that, like, the competition's weak at and you're strong at and, like, you kinda wanna let them know, but you don't wanna sit there and just dump on your your competitor? What's, like, the artful way for you to plant a landmine? Yeah. Great great question. So at Orem, we follow MEDDIC methodology. Right? And part of MEDDIC is decision criteria. And so understanding what is their criteria for this evaluation. Now is part of the criteria that the solution must integrate well within our technology stack? It's that it must have an intuitive interface. It must have dedicated client success. It must deliver a core problem. It must fit in with a certain budget and pricing model. So if you go through their decision criteria and you discovered what that decision criteria is throughout the the call, you can better position yourself based on the strengths that you have over your competition against their decision criteria. Right? That's when you're gonna you're gonna resonate over your competition. If they're telling you, hey. We just invested in ZoomInfo. Yeah. We rolled out Outreach last year. This year, we're going on on a a big investment on enablement and and and going through a deeper level there. Those, for us, are signals that these folks clearly care about investing in the technology that their reps interact with every day. So for us, we're gonna lean in on that. We're gonna say, hey. It sounds like it sounds like you're someone that is investing a lot in modern technology, enabling your reps with the best experience possible when they're out there prospecting every day, reducing the chances for for them to to burn out or bang their head against the wall, you know, working from home, prospecting all day. So we're happy to say we we've built a modern solution. It's It's best in class technology that integrates with all the solutions that you you've described. And we also have a very transparent and easy to follow business model. So I know you mentioned pricing is important. For us, we charge one rate. It doesn't matter how much you're using the solution. Many of our competitors, they actually charge a consumption model. Right? So for them, the more dials you make, the more money they make. So they don't care if your data isn't clean or they don't care if you haven't invested in a ZoomInfo. For us, we wanna make sure that you're able to use the solution as much as you want in any manner you want, and the price doesn't change. So CFOs tend to appreciate that. I do that a lot recently. Instead of, like, feature selling, feature versus feature, I almost talk about the business model versus the competitors business model. Because if you can show that your organization is incentivized in a certain direction and your competition's incentivized by their model in a different direction, features and things like that start to matter way, way less. So we've ripped apart the disco, and now we've gotten all this ammunition on our competitors. We've talked about how the business model is different. And, eventually, you probably have to show this thing. And I know you have some ideas on how you should be demoing the full picture, and I'd love to hear what are you doing differently in the demo, both in a competitive and noncompetitive situation. Great question. So we're big fans of discussing and demonstrating the holistic view of where our solution fits into their sales stack. So we've actually set up demo accounts with every possible integration we have. So we will demonstrate Outreach, ZoomInfo, Orum, Salesforce, SalesLoft, Gong. We show you the whole picture. From your reps day in the life, we pull up the schedule. What are your reps doing every day? Right? That's part of our discovery questions. Well, they're going in, they're researching on LinkedIn sales now, they're pulling a list or enriching it with ZoomInfo, then they throw it into Salesforce, they build a list, then they select all and click sequence all. And then they start making calls. So we show them that whole experience and where Orum actually plugs in and how seamless it is throughout that process. And then we actually make some live calls. So giving that full view, it doesn't matter what your solution is. If you're plugging in into some sort of life cycle, it's only gonna impact that prospective buyer. Right? It's gonna reduce the uncertainty to a level that's gonna help them understand. Okay. I see this. I can see how I can live my life with this every day and or how my people can live their lives with this every day. And so this is sometimes this has a negative connotation, but oftentimes, we call this there's a golden path in your demos. And you should know every time you're gonna start here. You know when you get to the page where it has the big table, you're gonna click on this person. You're gonna ask these types of questions. And then based on what you learned in discovery, you can have multiple branch off pass, but a lot of people will just pop in the middle of the software. And when you get a question that's like, so can you show me, like, what happens after you push that button? Or what does the whole workflow look like? Or how did this data get into there? When you get those types of questions, that means you've lost them in the middle of the forest of your software. And so I totally agree with you, Colin. On that note, I would love to understand as you're taking them through that path, what types of questions are you asking them so it doesn't become Colin's twenty minute speech on why Orem is great? Yeah. I mean, I I love to use the product for discovery. So in the case of Orem, you can ask them, hey. How are your reps prospecting today? Are are they sequencing their own leads, or do you have a marketing team sequencing on their behalf? And if they're they're sequencing on their own, I say, okay. Great. Are you guys are are you following this process? You're you're going here in the LinkedIn, putting them in the sequence. You can actually walk them through that live on your screen. Yeah. That's exactly how we do it. Okay. Great. So where we're gonna come in now is once they've put them in a sequence and you click sequence now, all of those call tasks are gonna show up inside of Orem instantly. Anything that's due today or past due is gonna show up right here. So it's allowing it to be conversational, versus you going through a full it's the salesperson show. The more you get them talking and sharing plus a visual, it is gonna lend you success. Right? You got folks that are visual learners, and you got folks that are okay just hearing what you have to say as well. So I think doing that both in in parallel, it's only, again, gonna increase the chances that you'll you'll hit the mark there. So okay. We've talked about great discovery, competitive situations, really good demos. Now, eventually, you probably get to a point where, like, the customer is almost ready to buy and you're you're going through some negotiation. And I know you have some hot takes on some best practices for negotiation, so throw them at us, Colin. Absolutely. So so there are rules for negotiating. The first rule is make sure that you are the number one choice. You are the vendor of choice. You don't enter a negotiation unless you have heard from that perspective buyer, hey. It's you guys. You guys are my number one. So if they're starting to talk about pricing and terms and x y z, and all can you throw in extra months, throw in extra reps, more licenses. Hey. The price is too high. Hey. I'm curious. Are we are we your top choice here? I know you guys did the test drive of of that solution, this solution, and us. Are are we the one that you wanna work with before we even get into the details? If they're not saying yes, and if they're not backing that yes up with at least three whys, so I we we we ask them, hey. Are we your top choice? Yeah. Yeah. Or you guys are my top choice. Hey. Why are we your top choice? Well, my reps loved it. You guys were awesome to work with. I just plugged in so easily with with our current workflow. Like, I feel like I don't have to change my process. My sales ops team loves you. So that's why, like, I I just see this as a better fit for the way we do things. Okay. Great. Now we can get into it. But if they're like, you know, well, you're not real you know, I don't know. You could be my top choice, but, like, the price is just too high. Like, you're not quite there yet. Don't even negotiate. Like, why are they your top choice? And, well, their price was lower than yours. Or, well, they handled the gatekeeper. You're not getting into a negotiation here. You're still you still gotta do some selling to do. You still gotta figure out other ways to add value, or you could bow out. The worst thing you could possibly do is negotiate when you're not vendor of choice, and all they're really trying to do is use and abuse you to get a better price with your competition. I love the really intentional use of the word why there, Colin, because the word why sometimes can put a customer like, the word why naturally makes the other person have to defend where they're coming from. And normally, you don't wanna put the customer on the defensive, except when you're asking them to justify why you're the number one choice. When you ask them why are we the number one choice, you are literally asking them to voice over and defend why you're number one. So let's talk a little bit about I've heard this this rule of negotiation called give forget. Can you explain to me how reps should be putting that into play? Yeah. Absolutely. Right. Never give something away without getting something in return. Right? And it's not it's not for selfish reasons. It it's really to help the natural flow of the negotiation. Hey. If I give you better terms on on your agreement, can I get in return a signature by the end of the month? Or can I get in return confirmation that we are your vendor of choice? Right? However you wanna leverage, you should have first of all, you should have a list of what gives you're willing to give. This is something that your manager should run through with you. And if they haven't, you as a rep should create a framework for a list of gives, ideally, non monetary gives. That means nothing to do with price. And those gives can be a better on like, a premium onboarding experience, maybe a free cold call training, maybe it is better payment terms on the on the actual agreement, maybe it is a price lock for three years. Have a list of gives that you know you can give away, and that you have the autonomy to do so. And then know what you wanna get have a list of gets that you wanna get in return. So the get could be an agreement by a certain period. It could be upfront payments. It could be, a reference or, a quote for the website or a video or a testimonial or, hey. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna get you what you want, but can in return, can you can you be my reference? Like, when I have other folks asking what makes us different, can I introduce you and you'd be a reference for us? So it's just some examples. Alright, Colin. This has been phenomenal learnings. We gotta move to our final question because we're running out on time here. So the last question is this. What is one piece of sales dogma that exists out there that you think needs to be picked up and chucked right into the trash can because it's garbage. This one popped in my head. Sales dogma that buyers are liars. I don't know if you've heard that before. I don't think that buyers are liars. I think that we often push buyers into a corner where they feel they need to save face and only way to do that is lie to us. And that could be by, like, promising a signature by the end of the month or pushing them into a place where there's unrealistic expectations that they feel they have to lie to us. Right? So that would be my kind of typical sales dogma. It's more on the buyer side. Right? I feel like, oh, buyers are liars. Like, they promised an agreement. I you said it was gonna close this quarter. Well, my champion said they were gonna close this quarter, but were you as a seller multi threaded? Did you hear that from three or four different people? There's a lot as a salesperson you can do to remove any risk that the buyer is going to lie to you. I wanna throw that expression out the window and focus more on what we can control as sellers. Right? Reducing the uncertainty, reducing the risk in the deal. There's a lot we can improve on all the time. Beautiful. Colin, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? I'm gonna plug Orem. So if you go to oremhq.com, that's oru,masinmother,hq.com/trial, We are giving away 500 calls included. You just self onboard onto our site. We will auto discover your sequence, your cadence, or you could upload a list. If you don't wanna go to your CRM, you can just upload a list. 500 calls on Orem will get you instant live conversations, and then take that data to your manager and see if we can become partners and help you guys hit all your sales goals this year. So thanks so much, guys. Really appreciate the time, and it was a a pleasure being on the show today. I love it, Colin. Thanks a lot for coming on, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode include number one, always get in front of the pros and cons. You can say, hey. They probably told you we don't talk to gatekeepers, and we probably can't get through those directories. Right? That's number one. Number two is after you say that stuff, now you can start asking them questions to handle those objections and understand their business better. What percent of your dials go to gatekeepers at all? Oh, are you on ZoomInfo? That means you're not gonna get in front of gatekeepers that often. Number three. Rule number one is you need to always be the vendor of choice before you're negotiating anything. You should not be giving away price because all you're doing is being abused for that discount so they can use you as leverage to buy somebody else. You're wasting your own time and you're wasting political capital. And then lastly, number four, build a list of non monetary gives and things you wanna get in return. Non monetary gives might be premium onboarding or commercial terms or payment terms or a price lock or training. But things you can get in return is you can get them to agree to sign before the end of the month if you give that stuff away or you can get a customer reference even. And so always have your give forgets. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out today? Well, I've got a non monetary give for you all. Look. Colin's an awesome guy, and we want him to know that the show was awesome. So if you liked Colin on today's episode, go on to LinkedIn and send Colin a friendly LinkedIn request and put something in the note. Don't try to sell him leads or something. Say, hey man, I heard you on thirty minutes to President's Club and I really really liked you. I promise he'll accept because if he doesn't, I'm gonna say something to him. Thanks for listening. We'll see you guys next week.
