## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Mark Pasaglo. And today, we have some hilarious disagreements. We're talking about something feisty. We're talking about setting quotas, comp plans, agreeing to a goal as a VP of sales, not overhiring, overhiring. It's the one and only Doug Landis for a repeat show. Mark, why should people listen? If you don't know Doug, you better know. That's all I'm saying. Doug is one of the most connected people, and I think that he just gives this really interesting perspective across a broad number of companies, stages, conversations, people. And I think when you get somebody with that in a room or on a podcast like this, I think we really take it to them and, like, talk about some of the assumptions. Like, how are board members? How are investors thinking about this? And I think it's a really interesting conversation around that kind of stuff. Alrighty, folks. And if you like what you heard, why don't you send Doug a DM on LinkedIn and tell him if you agree or disagree with the way that he wants to set the goals. Alright? And a three, two, one. Let's ride. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Doug. Well, welcome back to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. Number one, as a sales leader, it's so important. You are in the midst of q four right now. What I want you to do is I'll wait. You'll look at your incentive structure between now and the end of the year. This is for right now. You have to reevaluate your incentive plans. Look, it's really hard for reps to hit their number. We said less than 43% of sales teams are hitting quota. If I'm an AE right now, I'm freaking out. I'm not making any money. I got the holidays coming around. So I'm like, Mark, I got six mouths to feed. So what can you do? You can use spiffs. So put in a spiff or a kicker for a specific customer type. If you know your high value customers, the ones that are likely going to continue to expand, renew, upsell, etcetera. First of all, you gotta maybe gonna work with your CS team to identify who those good tier one customers might be. And then give a kicker if people close deals with that customer type or in a specific industry. The second thing is we're really relying on our existing customers for pipeline in many cases. So what if you close a deal and you get that customer to make an introduction to another person that's in a similar role and you book a meeting with that person? I would give a stiff or a kicker for that. So customer referral that actually charges you a meeting this quarter, it's another great little incentive kicker you can put in place to help your reps actually make some additional cash even though they most likely may not be hitting their number. Reevaluate your incentive plan, number one. The gift of spiff from Doug Landis. Doug, what's number two? Number two, build your model in 2024 for efficiency, not just growth. See, we have spent so many years focused on growth at all costs. And so what did you do? You hired for capacity and you're like, great. That's how I'm gonna get to my number. I've just gotta hire a bunch of people. That doesn't work when you're operating at sub 50% attainment. It's just not gonna work. What we really want, what your CFO wants, what your board wants, is we want you to be way more efficient. So as you're thinking about growing next year, adjust your incentive structure for if you if you're a VP of sales or if you're a frontline sales leader and you have this structure in place. And if your board hasn't told you you have to double, then what you do is now you set yourself up for growth in an efficient manner. So there's three things ultimately that you wanna do. First is if you can get your team, your frontline sales leader team to hit a 100% of our number one quarter for one quarter. If you haven't done it all year, then do it for one quarter. If you've done it half the year, three quarters of the year, then set them up for two quarters. And if they can get 80% of their team up to 80% attainment, then guess what? Give them free headcount, additional headcount. They don't take on the quota. You as the VP of sales, you take on the quota, but now they have a chance of actually hitting even more of their number and making some money because we all know the frontline sales leader job is the hardest job on the planet right now. The other thing you might wanna consider too is create an automatic promotion path. Basically, the opportunity is in their own hands. If they get a 100% of their number, two quarters in a row, boom, automatically promoted from AE two to AE three, AE three to a senior AE. If you create these opportunities where people actually can make a bunch of money or make some more money and you can drive the efficiency in the organization. So this also means that you've got to reorient your enablement efforts to be almost like account based, but I'm gonna call it individual based enablement plans. Each individual needs their own plan. If someone's been struggling and it's like they just can't get their pipeline up, well, then you need to sit down and work with them on ways in which they can actually generate more pipeline. And not just like consume this content, you're gonna be great. And if you don't, then, you know, it's on you. No. That's BS. As a leader, it's on you to get your team bolstered. And by the way, if they can't do it, if you give them all the support, the resources, you aren't coaching, mentors in the organization, they can't do it, well, now you've got a enough reason to get rid of them. On number one, Doug gave away a spiff. On number two, he's making sure everyone hits quota. On number three, he might be giving away his car. Doug, what's number three? Sorry. You can't take that out of my hand. Alright. Number three. This is pretty obvious, but you gotta put time into nurturing your existing customers. Question for you as a sales leader. How have you ever spent any time with your CS leader? If you don't own CS if you own CS, great. Good for you. But either way, have you ever spent time at actually evaluating your customers and identified which ones are your tier one customers, the high value customers? These are your babies. Right? Maybe it's in the marquee industry that you serve really well and you've got a lot of them. Well, the first thing you wanna do is make sure you go through and cure all of your existing customers. Like, who are our great ones? Who are not so great ones? Because look, your customers are an extension of your network. So tier your customers and then partner your AEs with their CSMs, with their tier ones to nurture those relationships so that you can again get those referrals. I'm gonna go back to suggestion number one. Connect it back to your incentive structure. But this is actually how you do it in the weeds because your existing customers have so much gold. There's gold in those conversations. The more time you spend with your existing customers, the better off you're gonna be. Not just the end of this year, but also next year. Alright, Doug. Let's dig in, brother. Eightyeighty. I remember that was my North Star when I was building out the 200 person sales team at Outreach. You know, 80% of the reps hit 80% of the quota. Dude, that ain't happening now. Like, get out of town. You ain't building a plan where it's eighty eighty. You say you can plan that, but I don't understand how you plan for that right now. When 43% of people are hitting their quota, there's pluses and minuses. It's not easy as playing an eighty eighty. Right? Yeah. But you gotta give somebody a target. You need something. And I'd rather get everybody up to that number rather than go add an additional headcount. And the problem is the board and your bosses are likely to go, go hire more. Go hire more Because they're thinking capacity. I gotta get to this number. Right? I'm at 10,000,000. I'm trying to get to 15,000,000, which is, you know, okay. That's gonna be a little crazy, but maybe it's possible because it's early. And they're like, we'll go hire four more AEs. They're like, no. No. Time out. I wanna get all my reps up to 90% attainment first before I actually do that. Your bosses might be like, that's crazy. And what if you don't do that? But then it's kind of on you. Yeah. Well, listen. I can get behind, like, hey. Before I hire more, I need to get the people like Dodd actually performing at a acceptable level. That makes a ton of sense. So, you know, Doug, you've seen it because you you're so involved in the VC community. There becomes a point, and I'd be interested to know what this point is, where you kinda wanna run hot. Like, I'm at that catalyst right now. I'm running hot, man. Like, I am I need my reps to do over a 100% of quota in order to hit my number, and I've done that purposely because I want them to make money. I had this one rep. I don't know if it's good or not, but he's like, I I need to have blood on my teeth. I need to be taking down deals all the time. I need my reps in tons of conversations so I can learn, so I'm running hot. But at some point, you transition to where you have to build capacity in because if you run too hot, you're gonna miss. Right? When are you having people transition? How does that work? How are you thinking about that? That's such a good question. And it kinda depends on the company that stage the market, the industry. Right? So there's so many variables with that. Right? Like, we've got some companies that are kind of on the fringe that Salesforce is bringing them into every deals, and they're crushing it. They're 200% of their number. And, look, I would rather run hot for as long as possible, like pushing the envelope as to whether or not the car may overheat than to be in that situation where we're, like, we're running out of pipeline. Like, I'd rather keep quotas low where everyone's able to crush it. I'd rather us just rely on our BDRs and our AEs to generate pipelines that we can go eat what we kill. That's just in this environment. It's kind of what we need to do to survive. You know, part of that the the challenge is what causes companies to kind of cool off is when your leadership thinks that because you're doing so well, we can actually push this machine even further and even harder. And that's kind of up to the sales leader. It's up to the CEO to have the real honest conversation, to do that bottoms up math, to identify the risks in the plan, the things that you have to believe to be true in order to actually continue to operate the way you're operating. And if you don't know those things and you can't actually use that in your argument to your CEO and to the board as to why, like, I'm good growing 30%. But if you want me to grow at 60%, we're gonna break. And that's what things are gonna cool off and people are gonna get unhappy. I'm super interested. Do you have, like, a story or an example of someone that really worked like a programmatic way to get that participation up really high like that. Like, you've you've got to have seen somebody that did something kinda cool or interesting that people that are listening to this would be, oh, that could be something I could try. Yeah. Yeah. The sad reality is is it's kinda simple. Mhmm. And, Mark, you you and I, we're old school. Right? So we go back to basics. I have a company. I'm not gonna name names, but they were one of the companies that was like, okay. They their the board was like, I need you to triple. And I sat down with the team, and we did the bottoms up math. I'm like, let's just say the number was four that they were at. They wanted to get to 12, and I was like, we're lucky if we get to seven, eight max. Right? And that is and, unfortunately, I can't tell the sales leader to say, this is not really my responsibility to be like, don't sign up for this number. Yeah. They signed up for the big number and this, two quarters in a row, and then you got canned. We went out and hired a new sales leader, and it was so interesting. Just just solid fundamentals is what she introduced. I love the fact that she's just a badass female sales leader. She's just fundamentals. And so she reoriented our ICP and who they were targeting, and then they she reoriented the messaging so that our outbound and inbound reps actually had the right things to say to the right people. Just total fundamentals. And then she got involved in all the right deals. Oh, by the way, she also went out and hired a whole bunch of people that she used to work with. So she changed the landscape of the reps that were in the organization. Let's talk about a theoretical 2024 planning process, and let's make this really, really real for the audience. So, Mark, you talked about a concept called running hot earlier, and I wanna explain what that means for the audience. So you guys correct me if this is different from your understanding. But in my experience, the first thing that happens before you talk about the number of reps, the capacity model, the implied attainment, Oftentimes, there's a number that is in mind, and sometimes that number comes from your CEO or finance or a combination of all of the above. And there's a point at which that number starts to hit you as a VP of sales or as a CRO. And oftentimes in partnership with rev ops, what you then need to do is you need to determine, okay, how many reps do I actually need to hit this? What are the implied capacity numbers? What's the implied attainment, number of headcount by segment, etc? And so what Mark is talking about when he talks about running hot is Mark might say, I have 10 reps that each have a million dollar quota, for example. Let's call it a $10,000,000 annual target for a CRO. By running hot, that would mean that Mark's actual target is closer to $12.13, or 14,000,000. In other words, if you just add up the quotas from all of your reps, the quotas equal $10,000,000, but Mark's actual number is higher than that. So he's relying on the over attainment from his reps to hit that number. Is that correct, Mark? Yeah. So a better concept is called street quota. If I have 10 reps at a million dollars each, I got $10,000,000 of street quota. Right? Now we know that some of those reps aren't gonna perform at a 100%. We know some of them are going to get out of the business. We know some of them are gonna leave. We're gonna have to ramp in new reps. So what what we need is, on average, for a $8,000,000 number, we need $10,000,000 of street quota to absorb all of those things that we know are gonna happen in the business because it's not gonna be 10 reps hitting a million dollars. Right? So running hot is the closer my street quota gets to my number, the hotter I'm running. And then running really hot is when your quota number is actually less than your number. That's running hot. Lovely. Yeah. Because at the end of the day, you're giving yourself cushion. So here's the other thing. If everyone performs a 100% and they all get to their number, you're likely your numbers are too low. Right? So finances could be like, your quota's too low. Everyone's making too much money. And our cost of sales too high. Right? So that's the trade off that you're constantly evaluating is like, okay. Are people making too much money, or are they not making enough money? What I mean by running hot is, like, if I've got a $10,000,000 number, and in this case, you've got 10 reps, the idea would be, well, you need 12,000,000 in quota coverage. So you probably need 12 reps to get to your 10,000,000 because not everyone's gonna operate at a 100%. That's everybody operating about 80% attainment. Right? That's great. What I want, though, is if I've got a $10,000,000 number, what if I reduce their quotas to give them some more incentive? So maybe I hire one extra person. Maybe I have to hire one extra person, two extra people, but I'm gonna reduce their quotas because I want them feeling good about closing deals because it's momentum. Right? You get momentum. It's gonna cost more, and that's the fight you're gonna have to make. It's the same fight as, like, alright. I'm operating at 80% or 20% overage. It's all about the battle that you're willing to take. And this is where the running hot comes in. It's just like, you tell me, Doug, you've you've seen a lot of sales teams. Who works harder? The rep that is 70% of quota trying to get to a 100% or the rep that's a 100% of quota trying to get to a 130%? Who works harder? 100% rep. That's right. Because he's in accelerators. And so when we step people up with these quotas that are too high and we're not running hot, then they don't get that extra, oh my god. I'm making 20% on every dollar I sell. I'm gonna go out and find out every penny I can find in my territory. Yes. Yes. Yes. They actually work late nights because they're like, dude, if I can find a couple more deals, that means maybe I make an extra $4 in commission this month or this quarter. Guess what I can do at $4? Well, there's my family's vacation for the holidays. It's that. But when you're at 70%, you're like, you have no line of sight of getting to a 100. You're just like, alright. Well, I'm just gonna keep cruising. Guess what? I'm gonna check out at 04:00. Yeah. I'm gonna push some of these deals in the next quarter because then maybe I have a chance to over exceed then. Right? At the end of the day, just never forget this incentive stripe behavior. If you're not getting the right behavior out of your reps, the very first thing you have to look at is your incentive structure and what are they getting paid on and what's motivating them. So I remember there are basically two different battles that you guys are talking about fighting. The first battle is I need to fight the goal. Right? So if I'm at 10,000,000 and they put a 50,000,000 target at me, you gotta fight that goal. Otherwise, you're signing your own resignation at that point. Right? That's number one. Let's come back to that. Number two is once you've aligned on a goal, you need to sell finance on hitting it your way, not their way. In other words, oftentimes, for example, at Pave, I was thrown a puke worthy revenue target, and it was like, go hire more reps than you think you need to hit that target, and that was when it was a bull market. And I remember at Carta, our VP of sales, now CRO, Jeff, he looked at me and he's like, we're running lean on our capacity model. And every single day, I get told by finance and our CEO that I'm ruining the company because I'm not hiring more people. So, literally, those are the types of things you have to fight. Right? And so, Doug, you've been on far more boards and in far more board meetings than me. Mark, you've been a sales leader far longer than me. Let's say that you've aligned on you're gonna do a double or if you're earlier stage, you might be doing a triple. Right? If I wanna go and I want to now explain to finance that I don't wanna just capacity model my way and hire as many reps as possible. I'm actually curious, Mark. How did you sell the concept of running hot to finance? So the way that I do it is I say, listen. I do exactly what I just did with Doug. Like, who works harder? 70 to a 100 or a 100 to a 30? I want my first reps to make tons of money so they tell their best rep friends to get over here. You want rapid iteration on your sales cycle, which requires lots of conversations, and so conversations need to be had with a few amount of reps and a lot of reps. And then lastly is I need people to feel engaged. And the way that a rep feels engaged is they're busy. My number one rep at Outreach, this guy named Riley Devine, he's a magical seller. Whenever he would feel feel like he wasn't busy, he called me like, I'm not busy. I need more deals. I need more deals. And every time I give him more deals, he would blow it out of the water. And finally, I was like, how do we just keep Riley fed all the time? Now we eventually found a part where, like, okay, can't keep giving Riley stuff. We try to do it in a fair way across the team too. But, like, I need that rep so engaged that he's not thinking about anything other than how do I close another deal because every deal is another fishing trip I get in The Pacific. Yep. By the way, as you grow in scale beyond the 30,000,000, you can still be mindful. At the end of the day, what matters to the board? Right? Is it like look. Efficiency really matters because it's gonna matter when it comes to raising your next round of capital. Yeah. You may be growing really well, forty, fifty, sixty, eighty, even a 100%, but, like, are you growing efficiently? Because that in this market today really matters. And so I wanna get the decrease in the goal and the decrease in the hiring plan was by what you described, which is if you look at our numbers right now, the way that we're growing is destroying our CAC payback. Right? For those of you who don't know, your CAC payback is your customer acquisition cost. How long does it take you to make the money back that it cost you to acquire that customer? And I remember my CEO was like, dude, our CAC payback is really, really bad. I'm like, yeah. We got a lot of reps. Right? And we needed to hire into this target. And so I was like, if you wanna improve your financial metrics, you gotta not throw so many bodies at the problem and not have me double the team over the next year. Are there other things when I'm reasoning with my board or with my investors or my CEO, Doug, that have resonated to you when you get the sense that a VP of sales or a CRO wants to pump the brakes on higher, higher, higher? Well, I mean, the other number outside of your you know, there's CAC to LTV ratios, but the other number really is attainment. And attainment is largely associated with your overage. Right? If you're targeting an 80% attainment, right, that means 80% of your reps are likely gonna hit a 100% or more. But in this market, that's not the case. You can't be efficient in your growth if your attainment numbers are sub 50%. So why go hire additional people if all of your reps are operating somewhere between 4060% attainment? Nobody's actually getting their number. So if you wanna go argue for keeping your quota down, your gross target for next year, you wanna argue for why I don't wanna go higher double the size of my sales team or at least higher 40% more for next year, let's just look at the attainment numbers. And let's look at how they've been over the last four quarters. And so what should I be targeting from both of your perspectives? What did the bull market attainment and participation look like? And then what does bear market attainment and participation look like? And just before you guys answer, attainment is if you just add up how much every rep produced, right, and you blend all of their attainment together. Right? So if you have one rep that did a thousand percent and nine other reps that did 0%, your blended attainment is 100%. Your participation is what percentage of reps hit quota. It's a measure of consistency across reps. So your participation in that case would literally be 10% because only one of your 10 reps hit quota. So what were you guys seeing before in terms of average attainment or participation? And then what are you guys seeing today as a reasonable benchmark that anyone in the room can take away? Mark, I totally need to hear your answer. Because my answer's gonna be different because it depends on the stage of the company. Right? And that is a diminishing number as you scale up. So in a super unique position where I talk to revenue and sales leaders multiple times a day for eight years at Outreach, I would say that on average, it was, like, 65, 60 to 65% of reps were hitting quota, but the blended it meant was probably between 90 and a 100%. And, again, that's with the the haircut that you get. So that means most teams were getting close to their number or beating them. And they were doing that, but, again, on the backs of people when you're that's an inefficient business. Right, Doug? No. No. No. They were doing that on the backs of, like, three or four reps. Crushing it. Those three or four reps did 400% of their number. Similar to what to Arman's example. You got reps that are crushing it. So in that case, your participation is, let's say, there's 10 reps and, you know, your average blended attainment is 65%. So then you've got, what, a 40% participation. Right? In the bull markets, it was, what, 90% at series a, 80% in series b, dropped to 70% at series c, and then they continued for somewhere between 6070% beyond. The problem right now is series a's, in many cases, it's still somewhere between 8590%, but the numbers are different. Right? So we're not expecting people to go from one to four per se right out of the gate or four to 12 as what happens in series b. Those numbers are different. We're now we're going to, like, one to three. So because the target's lower, reps are actually hitting their numbers. Same thing with series b. But instead of from four to 12, it's more like, let's go four to nine. Right? So the numbers are just different in in the early stages, but clearly from series c and beyond. It's like all of a sudden, if somebody started to count walks as at bats, the batting averages are gonna change. And so and what you're saying is is in this case, the attainment has stayed the same, but that's because the numbers have been drastically decreased because the just aren't as high as they were. Correct. Yeah. At least it you know, for our companies. There are other firms out there that are still maintaining the kind of their high standards because the companies come out swinging and they're producing, and they're like, okay. Well, let's keep pushing it. It. Just some release of AI. That's worth a x or two, isn't it? Mark always brings up AI in the last five minutes. It's it's the five minute AI closer for Mark. Alrighty, Doug. So we've talked about a lot of things that you should do, and, frankly, we talked about a lot of things already that you shouldn't do as a sales leader when it comes to setting comp plans, agreeing to quotas, and whatnot, and we end every episode with a shouldn't. So if there was one thing that every sales leader in the world should stop doing today, what is that thing? You should stop taking your reps forecast at face value. Woah. Woah. Woah. Somebody got spicy in the last minute. That's curveball. Waiting for the USAI for the forecast now. We gotta really round this one out. Oh, god. No. Yes. Yeah. Stop taking your revs forecast and face value. I mean, back to mark we weren't just talking about this before. Right? We have to get back to fundamentals. And guess what those fundamentals mean? It's being truly being able to understand whether or not you have a real deal on the table that is progressing and that they're actually willing to go to bat. And, I mean, look, the question that I always challenge people to ask is, like, okay. So have you had this conversation with the mobilizer of, like, exactly how they're gonna have the conversation with the CFO to actually get budget allocated for this? Because if you haven't, this isn't a real deal. I'm not forecasting this deal. Because the likelihood of the CFO saying no is so high that forecasts are just getting blown up all over the place because the little steps they're missing are actually really big ones. Boom.

Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alrighty, Mark. What'd you think? I thought it was good. Listen. Doug, like I said in the beginning, has a unique perspective. And I think one thing that he hit on that if I was a sales leader listening to this, that I would really pay attention to is, how do I start to construct my argument that I'm gonna get the reps I have to perform better rather than bringing on new people. And I think that the w you know is way better than the w you don't, and it's easier to work with somebody that you already know and get them improving versus to bring on somebody new all the time. Now that doesn't mean hang on too long, but it does mean, like, can you create an argument to help your company understand what you're trying to do there? Yeah. What was interesting is I think you guys had differing approaches for how to get to healthy revenue. Doug's approach was 80 by 80. Right? Get everyone to 80% of quota. Yours was like, hey. Let's make sure that our top performers are happy and feasting and have good win rates because they're gonna make up the share for the rest of the people. Neither of you guys were saying keep hiring, keep hiring, and just try to scrape your way to your number. Yeah. We're gonna pass those days. If you can't think past that, if you can't figure out how to take somebody that gets 40% of quota and move them up to 60 or from 60 up to 90, then you're gonna be hard pressed right now to keep a sales leadership job because that's the challenge. That's right. And, folks, I think we're, like, five, six, seven episodes in. And one thing that I wanna say is Mark has personally taught me a ton. And if you like learning from Mark, I certainly do. Go check out his course. The link to it is gonna be the top one in the show notes right here. It's gonna teach you a lot whether you're a rep, a sales leader, or something else. And this has been wildly fun interviewing with you so far, my man. So I look forward to more of them.
