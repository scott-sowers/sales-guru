## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Armin Farouk. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have a special episode with the best guest in the world. It's all of you. And here's the deal. We just got off of two back to back sessions on thirty minutes to presidents club live. We don't really like to call it a webinar, but it was sort of like two webinars back to back. And it was part one on cold calling openers and value props, and then part two on hand to handle objections. And along the way, there were over 2,000 people each time that registered. And, unfortunately, there are so many sad unanswered questions that we felt so horrible that we had to answer them live today. And so we're gonna go through three things. The first bucket is tone, how you prep for calls, and anything else. The second bucket is openers and value props. And the third bucket is how you handle objections. We're gonna go through key tactics and takeaways from each session in each of those buckets, and, of course, we'll answer some questions that we missed along the way. Nick, why should people listen? So I was talking to my CEO the other day, and he said 99% of the sales outreach he gets is email and LinkedIn message. And one of our philosophies here at thirty minutes of Presidents' Club is you should always zig when everybody else zags. So if you want to set yourself apart and become an elite salesperson, you gotta pick up the phone to book some meetings. That actually starts with everything you do before you pick up the phone. So the first thing you do before you even make a cold call is you've gotta plan your attack and then attack your plan. The worst thing you could possibly do is try to do your research and then make a cold call. Do some research, make a cold call. Split those things into separate buckets because they require totally different head spaces and energy levels. And if you want a pro tip, if you've sent a decently tailored email, actually have that email pulled up when you're making the cold call because it will make your cold call sound really, really researched. There's no reason to do that stuff twice. Plan your attack. Attack your plan. Arman, talk to me about the general tone and demeanor when we're making these calls. Tactic number two is you have to slow down and laugh. And here's the thing, is you laugh very frequently, but most importantly, you laugh when you get an objection. The faster you speak when you get a tough rejection, the more you show that you are below the person you're calling and the more you let them know you're a telemarketer, that can be rattled. Alrighty, Nick. What's number three? Now, occasionally, you'll make a cold call and the other person, shocker, they won't answer the phone. And so you come to this tough decision. Should I? Should I not leave a voice mail? I always leave a voice mail, but I do it in a very specific way. What I don't start my voice mail with is, Arman, this is Nick Sigelski with thirty minutes to President's Club. The reason I'm calling you is because what happens when you're a CFO is you get about 40 of those a day. And the way that you know someone is cold calling you is the beginning of that voice mail. All salespeople start with, Arman, this is x with y. Instead, leave your name and company at the end of the voice mail. So literally say, Arman, the reason I'm calling you, and that's those are the first words you say on your voice mail. Save the contact info for the end. You still wanna be professional and include it, but it doesn't need to come up front. Let's talk about some of the questions, Arman. So the first one here is, what is the best way to get rid of umms in a cold call? Best way to get rid of umms in a cold call is the same way to get rid of umms in your normal speech. When I'm not sure what I'm going to say next, like right now, it is doubly important to slow down versus if I talk really fast like this, I guarantee I'm probably gonna forget something that I'm gonna say, and then, there it is. Right? So there's the first that comes out of my mouth, and the reason is you're going way too fast. So the first thing you do is you slow down. The second thing you do is think of your cold call in buckets that are mini sprints that are always the same every single time. Your opener is always the same every single time. Your value prop is always the same every single time. When you get hit with I'm not interested, your answer should be same every single time. And so what you should do is practice all of these micro pieces so many times so that when you give your opener, you've given it a million times. Or when you get hit with I'm not interested, you practice that objection to be handled a million times and it comes off supernaturally. That's how you do it. Nick, now I've gotten rid of all of my umms, and a customer answers the call, and they're talking slow as a sloth. Right? And I'm going super fast. Do you suggest pacing and mirroring based on how people answer the phone? The key here is understanding what you want them to get to. So if somebody's talking slow, that's actually not a bad thing. That just might be how quickly they talk. So I do want to mirror to them if that's the state we wanna be in. But if they're hostile, one of the things you have to remember when you're in any sales call is that people respond or react in kind, meaning the way that you behave and act, they will actually match to. So if they're a jerk and they're like, well, where the heck did you get my phone number? I'm not gonna respond. Well, I found it on the Internet. What do you think? You gotta you gotta understand where you wanna bring them to. So it depends on the reaction that you get from them. Okay. We had another question here about voice mails. So let's go back. Let's talk about tone on voice mails. Does that matter as well, Armand? Yes. Absolutely. And so here's the thing is if you sound like you're giving a bunch of up tones or you say, like, something along the lines of, Pave is a compensation management software, and I just wanted to get in touch with Nick, you are sounding like a telemarketer. Your voice mails should sound like you're calling a friend. And what mine usually sound like is like, Nick, we work with a couple of Sequoia portfolio companies. It's, Armando Pave. I'm gonna send you a note. You don't have to reply to this call. Just reply to that email and let me know if it's even moderately interesting. Cheers. Super relaxed, comfortable. It makes it feel like he's supposed to answer my email because I'm familiar with him, and I'm a friend giving him a call. We should probably answer the the original question is which is should we even be leaving voice mails at all? It's It's a good one. I always leave a voice mail even if it's a very, very, very short voice mail. In the beginning, when I've done my research and it's my fresh touch to a contact, I'm actually gonna spend a little bit more energy on leaving them a substantive voice mail where I include all of the tailoring that I've done. But later in the process, when I'm on, like, my third or fourth call, there's not as much return on leaving a longer voice mail. So I'll make them very quick. My voice mail literally might be, Armond, this is Nick with thirty minutes to President's Club. Give me a call when you get a minute, please. Thanks. Boom. Done. And to that point, there is a law of diminishing returns of everything in sales. Contrary to popular belief, I do not believe you should do 500 cold calls a week. I think that's a colossal waste of time. I also don't think you should leave someone seven voice mails. I usually leave two. The first call is always the first voice mail, and it's usually a ten second voice mail with context only. So literally, Nick, I work with a couple of Sequoia portfolio companies. I'm gonna send you an email. Feel free to reply back to that one. No need to call me back. It's Arman at Pave. Cheers. That's it. The second voice mail is a little bit longer. It's twenty or twenty five seconds. And all it says is it's going to add the problem that I solve very briefly in that voice mail and, again, point back to the email. Alrighty? So, Nick, last question here on the topic of everything before the call and in between the call, tone, prep, everything else is, do you have any tactics for this weird pandemic world where people are working from home? How do I actually get people on the phone in the first place? Pick up the phone and call. That's part of the job. I I don't really have an answer to it. It's like, I think people make excuses to not actually pick up the phone and call, and the reality of what you need to accept is a phone call and a voice mail that are good, they can be effective without the other person actually picking up the phone. So a lot of reps will say, oh my gosh. I made 25 cold calls, and I only talked to one person. What a colossal waste of time. But what they don't recognize is that by virtue of calling and leaving a voice mail, they're actually strengthening their other touches. What Arman's talking about in that voice mail, he says, hey. I sent you an email. No need to reply to this call. He actually is forcing that person to then go look at his email. So don't think just because people aren't answering doesn't mean your messages are having an impact. Yeah. Here's the thing. This is very similar to the question of should I try to time my dials at a certain time of day? And my answer is absolutely not. And the reason for that is if you try to plan a 5AM or 6AM dial blitz and then a 4PM dial blitz and then a, 12:30PM dial blitz, you never allow yourself to get into any sort of rhythm. And the key thing with prospecting is doing a little bit every day first thing in the morning. So you do it and you get it out of the way instead of trying to time it so that by the end of the day, you're exhausted. What I recommend doing instead is do your prospecting every morning for an hour. Do your dials in the morning for an hour every single day. And then if you wanna mix up your dial times, sprinkle in twice per week, every single week on the exact same days, two afternoon blocks. So I'll usually do a Tuesday and a Friday afternoon dial blitz just to switch up the time zones from time to time. So I'm calling people at different times, but it's not screwing with my rhythm every single day. Alrighty. So enough about before the call, the tone, the voice mails, what have you. Now we're actually starting a cold call. So everything on openers and value props. Nick, first tactic. What do we got? You know I love my permission based opener. I always open with, Armand, this is Nick Sigelski with thirty minutes to presidents club. I know you didn't expect me to call you this afternoon. Do you mind if I take one minute? I'll tell you why I'm calling, and then you can tell me whether or not it makes sense for us to speak. I use it every single time. Nine times out of 10, the person says, all right. You got a minute. And I say, you know what? You can even start a timer if you would like to. And then I go into my pitch. Sometimes people say, well, Nick, what if they say no? Doesn't that open them up to turn you down? Well, nine times out of 10, they say yes. I have a way to handle if they say no. And there is a big difference on a sales call between somebody hearing what you're saying physically and actually listening with their brain. When you get permission and they opt in, it actually gets them to listen to your pitch, which is the intent of the call that you're making. Now, Armand, you do things a little bit differently, I know. Well, I combine my opener with the permission based opener. So my opener is called the heard the name tossed around opener. And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to get you to forget that it's a cold call. And it sounds like this. I'm gonna say, Nick, I work with a couple other Sequoia portfolio companies in the Valley. It's, it's Arman at Pave. Have you heard her name tossed around? And what I'm doing is a couple things. Number one is I'm not leading with my name. I'm leading with the fact that I work with other people in your investor's portfolio. So not only have I done my research, but I'm also not a complete rando. So immediately start to sit up, and then I end with an an assumptive ask. I say it's Armandette Pave. Have you heard her name Telstra? And the general tone behind it is you probably should have heard her name tossed around by now. Right? And it's a very relaxed opener. Here's the thing. They'll say yes or no. If they say no, I'm gonna roll right into the permission based opener. I'm gonna say, look, you're probably gonna hate me then. This I guess this is a cold call. Right? If they say yes, I don't have to pitch. All I say is, oh, you've heard our name tossed around. Awesome. Normally, we'd be working with someone like yourself by now. What'd you hear? Did we screw something up? That's it. Alrighty. Lastly, number three, before we get into the questions. Nick, once we've actually gotten through our opener, how do we describe what we do on the phones? Well, the timer little bit of buffer for them to calibrate. One of the things you gotta remember is you're cold calling someone. You're, like, shocking them out of what they were doing. And so give them a second to calibrate to, alright. I'm about to listen to a pitch. So I always say no problem. You could even start a timer if you would like. But then my framework here is I try to get extremely specific about a granular problem that we solve. Granular might not be the right word. I wanna be crispy. I want them to know that I am a expert in this space. So if I'm selling a billing solution to, a law firm and I'm calling the CFO, what I'm gonna start with is context. I might say, Armand, the reason I'm calling you is we work with a bunch of other CFOs of midsize insurance defense law firms like yours who have told me that they're frustrated with all of the deductions, rejections, and appeals that they get on their bills they send to insurance carriers. I'm calling you about something that makes that a little bit easier, and I'm wondering if you might be open to learning more when I'm when I'm not cold calling you out of the blue. What I've done here is context, problem, and then ask. I've said we work with a number of insert role and industry of the person that you're calling. Let them know you're not a rando. You're calling about their space specifically. Two, I'm giving a very specific problem that implies pain. I use the word they're frustrated. You might use the word they're anxious or they're stressed or they're upset. Imply pain. And then three, I'm not actually telling them a lot about how I solve that problem. All I'm saying is if you have that problem, I'm calling you about something that makes that a little bit easier. And if you'd like to learn more, we can do that when I'm not cold calling you out of the blue. So, Armand, I'm looking at the questions, and we got one here about your opener. They said, what are your thoughts on saying, quote, this is Justin from x x x. Oh, sounds risque. This is Justin from x x x. Does that name ring a bell? And then following up with a permission based opener. Is that too many questions or no? So it's not too many questions, for sure. I mean, that's exactly what I do, except instead of saying, does that name ring a bell, I say, have you heard our name tossed around? Right? And then I follow-up with the permission based opener. So not too many questions, assuming you allow them to reply in between your two questions. The key thing is, is the does that name ring a bell sound okay? And and honestly, at first sound like it it doesn't sound horrible, to be completely honest. Some people feel really uncomfortable saying heard the name tossed around. It basically gets at the same thing. I'll be honest. Just hearing it, it sounds a little bit more telemarket y, where you say, like, name ring a bell. Right? One of those types of things versus, hey. Heard her name tossed around is a little bit more casual and assumptive. And that's the tone you're going for with the heard the name tossed around opener is like, yeah, you've heard our name tossed around. Right? Not, hey, ring a bell type of thing. So it's a little bit more perky telemarketer y, so I'm not crazy about it. But if it comes off naturally for you, totally fine. It gets at the same thing. Alrighty, Nick. That's an easier question. This is probably the toughest one, and I don't even know what to do half of the time when this happens. You go into your permission based opener, you ask for twenty seven seconds, and they say no. What do you do? Well, you say no problem. When would be a better time to call you back? Now what's gonna happen is a couple things. One, they might hang up on you. That's fine. We can talk about how we handle that in a second. Two, they might say a time. Okay, great. You might actually then book a meeting and confirm with a calendar invite. Three, they might say, I don't know. What what is this even about? Great. Now you have permission to tell them why you called. So you can't ever try to force, well, it'll only be a second. If you asked permission and you got told no, don't try to shove your pitch down their throat. All you say is no problem. When would be a better time for me to call you back? If they hang up on you, here's what I do. You always assume positive intent. Assume assume that Verizon was the one who dropped the ball and that the phone line just got disconnected. Call them back, and then you're gonna say, hey, Armond. I'm so sorry. I think the call dropped. Can you hear me better now? Armond, still, nine times out of 10 is probably gonna be a jerk, and most salespeople won't have the guts to try that. But if you really wanna earn his attention, that's how you can get that hard to reach prospect to actually give you some respect. My favorite thing here is to actually completely agree with them. And, again, you'll get this concept later when we talk about objections is don't like to fight this. And so they say no, and they're usually angry. I'm usually going to apologize and say, like, oh, man. I probably totally screwed something up. Is it just because you're really angry at me because I cold called you? Or did I actually catch you in the middle of something right now? Because I can totally call you back if it's the second one. I'll never call you back if it's the first one. And you'll usually get a good laugh out of them, and then they'll tell you if they're actually busy or if it was just a cold call or they'll be like, alright, alright, what's this regarding? The great thing that you're doing there is there might be some people who'll be like, no. You can't, and then they hang up. Right? You're gonna get turned down anytime you ask the customer for permission. There will always be people out there who turn you down. They say no, and you've lost your chance. The thing is those people, you were never gonna get anyway. So I see a lot of people say, oh, you should just get to your point right away. If someone is, like, the anti anti cold calls, they think cold cold calls are the spawn of Voldemort, like, you're not getting them no matter what words come out of your mouth. I love how you infuse the humor there. So another one we've got here is after you give your great opener, and then they interrupt you and they say, wait, wait, who is this? Do you jump into the meet or do you ask permission again? Yeah. So at the end of my opener, usually, I'll say it's Armand at Pave. Have you heard of any name Tossed Around? And what's not good is if they say, wait. Who is this? The the thing to not do is to literally just be like, Nick, Nick, we work with a bunch of Sequoia portfolio companies. It's Arm on a Pave. Have you heard her name tossed around? You do not repeat the same opener again because they remember the tone. They just don't remember what you said. So usually what I'll say is I'll make a joke out of it. I'll say, like, it's Armon at at Pave. Like, pave a sidewalk. Come on. You heard her name tossed around? No? Not ringing a bell? Right? And that'll usually be like, come on. I'm joking around. I just repeat the last part, and I'm, again, sort of brushing shoulders with them, buddy buddy, and being like, hey. You've heard our name tossed around. Right? Oftentimes, the reason you'll get that question is if you think about how somebody, like, picks up the phone and answers, sometimes the phone isn't even to their ear yet, and so they literally don't hear the first part of your your question. So you've gotta sort of learn the timing side of it, and you'll know when you need to repeat in full versus you can even say, well, how much did you hear of what I said? So that's a good one. Alright, Nick. So we've talked about everything from when people say no to the permission based opener to if you give a great opener, but they don't even remember who you are, what do you do? The last one to wrap this one up is let's take it all the way back to the beginning of the call. How does this stuff change if you've gotten in touch with someone before? Or in other words, you know it's like a closed loss opportunity or a meeting that you had that's a follow-up. Now what do I do? I love naming my follow-up tasks the words that I'm going to say when I follow-up with Armand. Here's an example. I cold call Armand, and he says, Nick, I can't talk with you right now. I'm about to eat a pepperoni pizza. And then he hangs up on me. What I'm gonna do when I call Armand back the next week is I'm gonna say, Armand, you and I last spoke on February 23, and you told me you had been about to eat a pepperoni pizza. I have no idea if that conversation rings a bell or not. And what I've done here is this is very important. I use the exact words Armond told me. I don't say, yeah. You said you're about to munch on some pepperoni and cheese. I say exactly what he said to me because that triggers something in his head by saying, oh, wait. That's the language I use. This person has talked to me before. And they're they're gonna respond there and say, wait. Wait. Yeah. I I think. Wait. Who is this? And then you roll right into either your heard the name tossed around opener or your permission based opener. But it's a fantastic way to get somebody's attention. That's why even if you get hung up on any information, you can get off the call, hang on to, write down, and use it when you approach them again. Beautiful. Alrighty. So we've finally gotten through all of our prep. We've opened with good tone. We have crispy problem propositions, and now we get hit with an objection. And what do you do when you get hit with an objection? The first thing you do is you take a page out of Karate Kid, and you act like mister Miyagi. And here's how you do it, is whenever I get hit with something like not interested or call me in six months, you have to agree with them, ask them a question that gets you more information, and then incentivize them or sell the meeting. What that sounds like is if they say call me in six months, I'm gonna say, absolutely. Would love to call you in six months. I'm gonna put it in my calendar right now. Just so I don't sound like a goon when I reach back out to you, could you give me a sense of what's going on in six months? They're gonna tell me what it is, and then I'm gonna try to pull it forward and incentivize them to take a meeting today anyways. And so I'll say, hey. Usually, when someone says call me in six months, it means there's, like, some degree of interest. Honestly, you're not gonna buy Pave right now, frankly, for the next six months. Why don't we jump on a call for something like ten minutes next week? I can give you the harbor tour. And if nothing else, you'll have a sense of what's out there. So you don't have to do the whole dog and pony show in six months, and you can just pull the trigger then. Sound good? Awesome. I've sold the meeting. I've pushed away, and I've made it clear I'm not gonna try to sell you immediately. Alrighty, Nick. But before that, you get slammed with an objection, and you do something called the ledge. What is number two? The ledge. Most of the time when you get hit with any objection, your brain starts to rattle. Oh my gosh. I'm getting rejected. This emotional part of our brain freaks out, and all you do is you actually memorize a response. You might say something like, Arman, you do the laugh. Even there, you said, absolutely. I'll I'm happy to call you in six months. I might say something like, well, I figured you would say that, or, you know, everybody says that. The key here is you're saying sort of a neutralizing, agreeing statement that buys your brain a second to catch up for what you're actually going to say. A great example of this is something we actually learned from Sarah Brazier today on the 30 MPC Live episode, where what she does is if Armand says, we don't have budget, she says, got it. You don't have budget. And then she asks a question. So the key is, for her, she says the word, Got it? She repeats the last couple words that Arman says to show she was actually listening and implies, I wanna learn more, and then she asks a calibrating question. So the key here is don't try to fight the objection right away. Neutralize first and then seek to understand before trying to be understood. Now sometimes, we're gonna have prospects who aren't so happy that we're seeking to be understood and they get aggressive, And they might say things to us, Armand, like this question here, which is they say, how did you get my phone number? For this one, you have to be disarmingly blunt. K? There's no mister Miyagi ing here. It's just being straight up. And so I'm gonna say, oh, well, I don't know what secrets you got here, but I would love to take a page out of your book if you've never been cold called before. I got your number on a program called ZoomInfo as in our CRM. I can totally take it out, but I guess so I make sure that no one calls you again from here. Could I get twenty seven seconds to tell you why I called, and then you can hang up on me then, and I'll take your phone out of our list. Sound good? So again, I'm just gonna agree with them, make a joke out of it, and ask for permission, and incentivize to them to at least hear me out and then hang up on me afterwards. Alright, Nick. So now we know that we've secured their phone number on some sort of whatever lead finding software. And now they say, you know what? You shouldn't have called me in the first place. Nick, why don't you just send me an email? Now what do I do? Same framework. You do the mister Miyagi. No problem. I would be happy to send you an email. You know, you're the first person all week who's actually asked me to do that. So I wanna make sure that I get this right for you. I actually sort of play up the fact that I'm gonna do some hard work on your behalf, mister customer, so that I can put something together that's actually really compelling for you. Like, what would you like me to put in that email? If they give you a real answer, you might then say, okay. Cool. I guess, would it be helpful for me to give you a little context and background now on this call before I put all of it into an email? Would Would you like me to send you a video? What you wanna do is, like, make a point that you're gonna do some hard work. If they give you a generic answer, like, you know, just an overview of your services or, I don't know, whatever you normally send, here's where you you bias towards that disarmingly blunt. You say, hey. Can I ask you a sort of weird question? They're gonna say, okay. Everybody's like, what? A weird question, and that makes them lean in. And you say, oftentimes, when when somebody says just send me an email and they just want a general overview, it's it's really just them being polite and they're not actually interested in my crummy cold call. Am I totally off base or that might be what's happening here? The key here is throw yourself under the bus. They'll either save you or you'll know that it is not an email worth putting together. Arbonne, let's wrap us up here and tell me what you do when they say, we're happy with our current solution. So you say, I'm happy with my current solution. I'm gonna say, oh, you have a comp tool. Awesome. You know, the vast majority of the time, it doesn't really make sense to switch off of these things. And so do do you mind if I just mark it on my end? Like, who are you guys using just so I make sure no one calls you again? Awesome. Now I know the competitor. Once I know the competitor, it doesn't matter what we do better than them. My answer is the same every single time. I'm gonna win through social proofing, and I'm gonna sell the meeting by creating a little bit of mystery. I'm gonna say, oh, oh, oh, you're on them. Interesting. So this might be crazy, but look. My guess is still, like, you're probably doing, like, perfectly fine on that tool. But we've had a couple of customers switch over from x to us. Would you be completely against, like, get getting, like, the ten minute harbor tour at Pave? And then if nothing else, like, we we can give you a sense of, like, when and why other folks have switched, and you'll at least leave the conversation a little bit smarter. Is that okay with you? My guess is you won't buy anyway. So, again, I'm just pushing away, pushing away, pushing away. And what I'm saying is, don't you at least wanna know why other people have switched off the tool that you're using today? And that's how you mister Miyagi it. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes.

If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alrighty, Nick. We went through the tone. We talked about slowing down, planning your attack, attacking your plan. We went through openers and value props, the permission based opener, the heard the name tossed around opener, your crispy problem props. And then, of course, lastly, we talked about being mister Miyagi as you step towards the ledge and making sure you don't immediately react the moment someone hits you with an objection, but you slow down. You mirror and you ask them a question. And, Nick, the last thing we need to do is we need to now tell people. Now that we've helped them on the phones, how can people help us out today?

The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
