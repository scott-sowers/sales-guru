## Transcript

Morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost Nick Sigelski. Today, we have the hall of fame episode, the club member, the multiple time guest, the one and only Jason Bey, CEO of Outbound Squad. Nick, why should people listen? This was a great episode talking about how to deal with competitors, both greenfield deals where they have nothing in place and it's you versus a competitor, but then also rip and replace deals. And we talked about everything from how you should be addressing the competition to how you should be stacking the deck in your favor. We we talked about how you can talk about your solution versus talking about impact. We got into how you can test your champion to determine if you're winning and then what to do if you are and the champion likes you. So this was a great episode to help you win more competitive deals. In three, two, one. Let's roll. Alright, Jason. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaway. So let's get your three. First one is competitor takedown campaigns. I see a lot of companies running outbound competitor campaigns like this. Hey, Nick. Saw you're using our competitor. They really suck because of x y z reasons. Do you wanna take a meeting with me? That is not how to run a competitor takedown campaign. When you know that someone is using a competitor, that is a way to point your efforts on the right accounts. And what you need to really know is what's the differentiation and what is the problem they are not able to solve because they're using that competitor. So that's the first one. With competitor takedown campaigns, we're not going to attack the competitor in the cold email itself. Great. What's number two? Number two is we want to address the competitor head on and not be shy about it. I'm working with a customer right now that sells in the construction space. It's a very competitive space. They have a competitor that is a third of the cost, and they sell against someone that is 10 times the cost. And there's sort of that middle solution. Their reps are very shy about talking about competitors even when they know that they're using a competitor and they're not moving from pen and paper. I want to address that head on and ask, Armand, before we dig in today, you had a great conversation with Nick. I have to ask you. You're using competitor a b c. What made you decide to even take the call today? Why are you entertaining switching? And get them to sell me on why they're entertaining switching, and that creates the talking points for the conversation that we're gonna have with them. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Great. What's number three? Third thing, the total cost of ownership play. I see a lot of companies attempting to pull this off, and it sounds something like, you use five tools that you're piecing together. We have one. We could save you a thousand dollars a month. When you take that angle and position yourself like that, I don't wanna start a sales cycle where people are only gonna buy my thing if it makes their other stuff cheaper. I don't wanna be in that conversation. The value conversation is what can I unlock? So I have a customer that sells another different solution to contractors. And what she found is that the fact that the customer is able to do a live inventory analysis of how much materials they have for these large construction projects, when they don't have that, they're overspending by $30.40, $50 per project across dozens of projects over the course of the year. We're talking about a problem that is millions of dollars over the course of a year versus we can save you a thousand dollars a month. When she positioned the solution around unlocking something that would create a ton more profit in these jobs, it was a no brainer for them to switch solutions. So those are my three takeaways. So, Jason, let's start at the very top level. In the prep, we were talking about two types of competitive deals. You have rip and replace deals where someone is using a competitor and you literally have to rip them out. And then you have greenfield competitive deals. In other words, they have nothing, and they are considering buying you or a competitor or possibly staying with nothing. How do you think about rip and replace deals versus greenfield deals? So the beauty of a rip and replace is that the customer is already sold on fixing the problem that your solution solves, and they've already invested in fixing it. So the thing that I really need to understand in a rip and replace deal is why did they bring on a solution to begin with? And I think it depends on how the sales cycle gets started. Is it inbound versus outbound? But with rip and replace, I already know that they have a problem, and I'm gonna really focus on, like, where are the areas of differentiation that they might not be thinking about that I know that my solution can solve that they're not getting done right now. That's the stuff that I need to find. With rip and replace, what becomes exponentially more important is a strong champion. Because if you don't have a really strong champion and someone that's gonna go to bat for you, there's so much risk in changing solutions for a company. I mean, Gartner, I think the stats 56% of b to buyer b to b buyers report buyer's remorse in buying solutions. So it's really risky to replace a solution. I need to have a really strong champion. My business case needs to really address those areas of differentiation. I need to really talk about how we're gonna derisk implementation. I need to do all of those things. Greenfield is a little bit different because I really need to focus on the why change narrative. This customer might not even be sold on solving the problem or that a software solution is the way to solve that problem. So So it's a little different. You mentioned this in our prep. In both situations, but especially in Greenfield, as a rep, you can really over index on, like, the differentiation between you and the competitor versus why should we solve this problem to begin with. Rip and replace is a little different. It's more of the why us conversation versus the why change conversation. Yeah. The other day, we had Chris Serti on. And for greenfield deals, he talked about the three whys. The first why that you need to answer is why buy anything at all? The second why you need to answer is why should they buy you? And then the third why that you need to answer is why should they buy you right now and not just delay the solution? Jason, one of the things that we were talking about earlier is that people will over rotate into the competitor and focus all their attention on this is what they don't do in a greenfield deal. They'll miss why they should buy something at all in that sales cycle. Are there other common mistakes? Or I'm curious for your reactions on that. I mean, that's the classic. Force management's been talking about the, you know, why change, you know, why now, why you kind of thing. I think with Greenfield, it's the same thing. We did a webinar a long time ago about objection handling. It's this idea that I need to get really comfortable teasing out the stuff that creates friction in a sales cycle that is good friction. And it with competitors, what people tend to do and make mistakes on with Greenfield, I make this mistake all the time, is I forget to ask if they're looking into a competitor. And I don't figure that out until mid to late sales cycle. I didn't get a chance to position everything around my differentiators. I'll give you a really good example. My biggest differentiator is tailoring and customizing the content and creating these customized playbooks. It's a big reason why my customers get good results. Now, if I am competing against someone that doesn't build playbooks under half the prices, maybe you talk about why you don't need that and your enablement team, they've gotten a chance to shape that narrative. I haven't built in any justification around why it cost twice as much as them. So I think with Greenfield and with any deal in general, I think a lot of reps have this fear of if I ask if they're looking into someone, it might prompt them to look into someone. I wanna assume that people are looking into someone, and I'm gonna ask that early as soon as possible so that I can position the rest of the sales cycle around those differentiators. But that's another big area that I find with Greenfield that people aren't thinking about. Jason, in my first two sales jobs, I got taught by my leaders that I should never say my competitors by name. You're advocating for addressing the competition head on. Should I be saying competition by name, and how should I be addressing the idea of competitors with my prospect? Yeah. If they want a list of people to look into, I'm happy to provide that list. If we get really tactical here, the way that I ask this question is, hey, Nick, I imagine you guys are looking into a lot of sales trainers right now and that you came to me. Do you mind sharing? Who else are you guys looking into? What are you looking for? I hardly ever get a bad answer to that question. The next place I want to take the conversation, I really want to talk about the landscape and how my customers think about making the decision. Let's do cybersecurity. So, with cybersecurity, there's all kinds of aspects around alerts. How do I get alerted? How do I prioritize? How do I mediate the alerts that I get? There is the visibility that I have. Is it the IT environment versus the OT environment in the manufacturing plant? The way that I would wanna position something like this is I would talk about organizations that we're working with, you know, companies like your Colas of the world. The way they really think about this is in three facets. There's the alerts and the things we need to be notified of. There's how does our team know what to prioritize? And then lastly, how do we fix those things and remediate them? There are a lot of solutions out there that do bits and pieces of that. What our customers really like about our solution is it does all of those three things in one place. The reason why that's important is not because it's necessarily more cost effective. It's that if I'm gathering all of the data across my assets in the same place where I can remediate them, I actually have a system to know what did we find, how do we prioritize it, and I can know that my team actually followed through and fixed it. Reducing that risk is really important for a lot of our clients. I'm curious, like, how are you guys thinking about the solution and fixing this problem from an alert standpoint, a prioritization standpoint, and then how you remediate it. So what I did there is I'm really positioning the fact that you really need to be able to do all of that in one place and what those benefits are and then teeing it off to the prospect to kind of think about that. The fact that they can do all three of those things is extremely rare. So that's the way that I wanna position it. It's really positioning the business model. Another way to do that is around pricing. I have another client that doesn't do proceed pricing. It's usage based pricing. You really need to, in competitive situations, paint the landscape of the different ways that people get stuff done. It's more about selling your model over the competitor model. When you talk about the why change and the why now, you're really addressing the business model, which is a conversation up here versus why you should choose us down here. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Jason, you mentioned that you have this HVAC solution client where they're sort of the middle tier of the options. There's a super cheap option, and there's a super expensive option. You just gave an example of painting the landscape where your solution is probably the most robust and you have the most value. How do you paint the landscape and paint your option as the best one when you're not the best solution? You might be, like, the cheaper competitor. How does that narrative change? How do you position your solution if you're not best in class? This is a really tough one. This goes back to what you're saying, Armand. What you don't wanna underestimate is the fact that when a buyer sees two solutions as fairly equal, the differentiator is how well you sell. The big thing with this customer to take in consideration is the measure of how well you sell is as a buyer. I'm coming on and thinking about what did I learn from this person? What are the insights? A lot of Chorus and Gong back in the day, we've mentioned a lot of this. Like, they went head to head on a lot of deals. And, you know, we love Gong right on this podcast. Gong lost some of those deals too because there were other things that the Chorus rep did that the Gong rep did. A lot of that was around insight shared, a person that can really run an enterprise sales motion and be consultative. A better buying experience is am I providing insights and actually educating my buyer? And am I doing a better job of that than the competitor that is 10 x more? I think the second thing is and these are just basics of selling. Does the buyer feel like I truly understand their priorities and their goals and my aligning effectively to those business priorities? This is like sales one zero one. Right? Am I multi threaded? Are there people in this organization that like the solution? One of the things I always have to remind myself of is just because I'm threaded with the VP of sales and CRO doesn't mean that they're not looking to their sales managers and their enablement people to ultimately make the decision on who they bring in. So how well am I not only multi threaded but single threading with the different users and people that are gonna be interacting with my solution? Running a really tight sales process, that is a differentiator. A lot of people think that every sales cycle means a prospect has three problems, and then a salesperson presents the solutions to those three problems. Oftentimes, the average seller can't even get those three problems or they can't get the buyer to vocalize those three problems, so they end up showing a lot of the things that don't matter or missing certain things in their product that would have mattered. It's not just like your buyers have a massive checklist where you're 70% losing in all the areas. When I was at Pave, we we had horrible feature parity. We were new in the market. We were three times as expensive, but we knew how to differentiate on sales process. Whenever we got pegged with a feature gap or an issue of some functionality we didn't have, we got really good at asking buyers why that even mattered and showing them Yep. Other ways to accomplish the same solution as long as they wanted to solve the big problem that only Pave could solve. If you're not number one in the market, you need to be number one at something. Figure out the customers that fit into that mold, whether it's the cheap customers who want the cheap solution or the customers that want all the fancy integrations. You've gotta find that sweet spot because if you're trying to sell the premium solution to cheap customers only, you're gonna lose a lot of deals that are gonna drive you crazy because, usually, you're not gonna win everywhere. That's a good point you bring up. We talked about this yesterday. I call it chunking up. When someone says your competitor has this feature, but you don't, yeah, you gotta chunk the conversation that, hey. Before we dig into that, what are you trying to accomplish through that? What is the problem that you're trying to solve? We just have a different way of doing it. If you're a smaller company or you're not the number one company, let's say a category leader, you got to think about how do I derisk the purchase for the customer? How do I make it less risky to use my stuff? I think one of the really underestimated things in large, mid market and enterprise sales is professional services like implementation. One of the stats that you can bring up is the one that I shared earlier around, you know, 56 of buyers having buyers regret. Seven out of ten change management initiatives failing according to McKinsey. I think talking about how you can help the customer successfully implement the solution and adding professional services to it can be really big. The other thing is I think you have a huge advantage at a smaller company where you can get more access to this. But getting access to your executives early in the deal is so big. Like, if you work at a huge company that's got five, ten thousand employees, no one in the c suite is gonna hop on a sales call with a prospect. They're not gonna do that kind of stuff. Think about where you're more agile and you can be a little bit more nimble through the sales process and get these prospects access to world class people on your team. Another thing around implementation, it depends on your implementation team and the customer success folks. But to a buyer, I think it can be really important. One of the things we can do and really prioritize is the team that I was telling you about that did the implementation for Shopify. We can prioritize them and make sure that they do the implementation for you. The implementation team, the professional services, think about the other things around the software that you can do to enable the buyer to get a better outcome. That's hugely underrated. Jason, we used to do that all the time when I was selling ERP systems to law firms. To your point, we were sort of the mid tier player. But because we weren't as big as one of our biggest competitors, Thomson Reuters, I could get our head of implement on a call on a moment's notice with a prospect where they would send no one or, like, some person who was not impressive at all. And what would happen is is prospect would then meet with our head of implementations, and they'd have a great relationship because this person would go super deep. And I can also use that as a way to drive timeline. We've got some slots open where the person you met with is gonna be running your implementation, but they're not just perpetually available. I can make sure that you get them and their team on your project. You gotta come aboard by this date. We could use that as a way to drive timeline. On the note of timeline, I've heard differing opinions about in competitive deals. This is, like, a head to head of the order of presenting. I've heard some people say, you wanna make sure that you do the presentations first because you can sort of set the criteria. And then I've heard other people say, no. You actually wanna go second because that leaves more of a lasting impression. I don't know if you have a perspective on you know, you're in a competitive deal, how you think about the ordering or even the pacing of progressing through the evaluation process? It's a good question. I don't have any data to support either way. I can give you my personal preference and what I usually recommend. I like being first to shape the buying criteria. I can tell you the most important thing if you're gonna go first is that you have a next step set with your champion afterwards. So I think regardless of the order, you don't always get to control the order Unless you have a really, really good relationships and they really like you, you're not gonna get to control the order. What I do want is two things. I want to have a call set up afterwards, after all the presentations are done, and I want a really good champion that feeds me intel. I have champions that send over the proposals that they get from my competitors. So you wanna have a really good champion? There is a benefit to going last in that you could have your champion feed you intel on what was talked about so far. Maybe that would be an advantage of of going last. I personally like to go first. I've had people cancel presentations because they saw three really liked one and just thought that was enough. They just went with one of the first three people that they saw. That's happened to me before. If I'm a rep, how do I get my champion to feed me that inside intel about how my presentation should go or even send over a competitor's proposal? Like, what do I say to my champion? So before their presentations, I'm gonna ask my champion. If the decision was up to you, would you select me? If that person is unsure or they say no, you're not gonna win that deal, dude. You're probably not gonna get that deal. So I wanna have that conversation, that candor with my champion prior to setting up those larger presentations. If I haven't sold the champion, I have some selling to do. I should be their number one choice. If they're my number one choice, then it's as simple as asking. Hey, Arman. Let's work together on this. I'm gonna be given the third presentation. I really want to hit on key points that maybe weren't brought up in previous presentations or areas of differentiation so that we can work together. Would you mind feeding me some intel? Can we talk after that first presentation? I will set up those calls and touch points. This is like some Jedi mind trick stuff. The rest of the buying group is not gonna know about that. But this is this I almost said dirty work. Dirty work almost implies that you're doing something bad. But this is the work I take it takes with these larger deals when you have a good champion to think about the politics of the buying group and have someone that can feed you intel like that. It's super important. But the answer to your question is I need to know that I'm that person's first choice so that they are actually a champion, and then it's as simple as asking them. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Let's say you don't know. You're the first choice yet, and they're about to start evaluating other competitors. How do you send them into those conversations? How do I send my champion into those conversations? Are you laying any trap questions or trying to skew the evaluation so that they look at certain things that the competitor is not good at? Absolutely. So for me, the big thing is everyone says they customize the training content, but hardly any sales trainer does that where they say, I'm going to teach you guys how to prospect to a cybersecurity leader. Here's what that sounds like. I love trap questions. Nick, I'm going to give you a couple of things that I think would be really good to look for and questions that you could ask to make sure that you're going to get a really good program from these guys. One of the first things is tailoring of content. What I would suggest you do, because what has happened to a couple of clients of mine is they were promised that the content would be tailored and they got cookie cutter tactics. I would really stress asking them to show you, hey, show me a talk truck. Show me an email that you worked on with a client that is actually tailored to them. The second thing is reinforcement. Reps forget 90 plus percent of what they learn in sales training within ninety days. Reinforcement is really the thing that pulls the training through. What I would really ask them is not only what their reinforcement plan is, but what framework do they have in place for reinforcement? How do they assure that habits stick? I wanna prepare them for specific criteria to look for. I've seen reps do a one pager on stuff like that. I should probably build something like that. You definitely want to shape and inform the buying criteria and give them specific questions to ask in areas that you're gonna differentiate. Before we wrap on this, we've been talking mostly about greenfield evaluations. I wanna go back to rip and replaces because those are really hard, and you can waste a lot of time on someone who's never gonna rip and replace because it's so painful. Talk to me about what are you looking for in a first discovery call on a rip and replace deal to figure out if this thing is real or not? I think the most important thing we've talked about so far is the strong champion. So if I have an inbound lead and it's a manager using the security solution, I'm really pissed about the solution and doesn't like it. If I'm not able to get any intel on an executive that is not accomplishing something because you're using this competitor, I don't have a very strong deal. If I can't, within two calls, figure out what executive really cares about this, I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on that. That executive is gonna inform the business case that you build that really quantifies that problem that is not being solved through that competing solution. Champion is the number one thing for me. No champion, no deal. If you don't have an executive that's willing to stick their neck out for this, because they're the one that is gonna be able to help you quantify the problem as well, to me, there's not really a lot there. A lot of times there are deals where if you went head to head with someone today in a greed field competition, you would win the deal. But because it's a rip and replace, the cost of the switch is so much that you will lose the deal. When I was at Carta, we would just win on having the slickest UX and Yeah. The zippiest product. But if someone was on our competitor, Shareworks, which is owned by Morgan Stanley, there's no way they were gonna rip out their cap tables. That was a three month process. At Pave, we were able to discern two types of rip and replace deals. The first type was if a company was on an existing compensation planning solution and they were not doing stock option bonuses, I could almost guarantee we were going to lose that rip and replace deal. We would beat them $50.50 if it was a greenfield deal, but we would lose it every single time because that was the one thing we could do that would be hair on fire for our competitors. Yeah. We knew they had to be planning those separately, and we knew that there were massive issues with planning equity and stock option bonuses if you weren't using a solution like Pave. And so it allowed us to basically filter a lot of the BS rip and replace deals that reps would normally spend months on if they thought that some of these nice to have things would have taken them to the finish line because usually they don't. I think you can also voice that over to the customer. When I was selling ERP software, it was harder to say, oh, they're on x system. They're not or they are going to switch. I sometimes got surprised by prospects that left tech. I thought it was better than what I sold, but they ended up migrating to us because it wasn't implemented properly or they saw something they really loved. But what we would do is something similar to that I've I've learned from you, Armand, where you really paint up how much work it's actually gonna be, not just to implement this thing, but even to evaluate it. And you explain like, hey. This is gonna take a lot of time from your team and from ours. We're gonna have a lot of demos. We're gonna have a lot of meetings. We're gonna have to talk about the tech and how everything connects. Is that something you really wanna go through? I think we're better than where you are right now, but it might make sense just to keep living with where you are today. When you push the customer away, you determine how serious they actually are. And when you build up, hey. This is gonna be some work for you. It gives them an opportunity to have an out. If they take the out, awesome. You just saved yourself a ton of time to go prospect for 12 more deals to fill your pipeline and make up for all the time you would spend on that other one. Yeah. Well and then one last thing to add to that is the example I brought up earlier. We have this feature that allow you to get a live feed of your inventory and your materials cost on these contractor projects. If we don't have that, we have this problem that's, you know, twenty, thirty, forty thousand dollars swing on these projects of materials multiplied by the number of projects. If we can't get access to a person that actually owns that problem, the profitability across the projects, the VP of operations, the COO, there's no deal. How do you I think really understanding and chunking up the feature to the business problem that it creates, you have to know the problem that the feature you have will fix that they can't, and then you have to get access to the person that owns that problem. You talked about this example earlier where if you can't, in two calls with a manager level contact, figure out the exact you need to get to, you'll basically walk away from the deal. How do you articulate that to the manager? Because I can't imagine you're just like, alright. You didn't get me anything. See you. Like, you don't wanna be a jerk, but you also don't wanna waste your time. So what do you say to your contact in that scenario? So the multithreading piece, there's kind of two routes that you would go. I'm either gonna get this person's help, or I'm gonna try to do it by myself. Obviously, I wanna get the person's help. That's the best way to do it. The conversation is gonna sound something like this. Nick, usually, when we're evaluating this, the the number one problem that we fix is that variability and profitability across the projects. We're usually gonna need input from a couple folks to really understand if it's worth the effort to change for you. Armand, I know, is your COO. At some point, maybe not right away, we're gonna wanna get his input on how this is affecting profitability in the company. I saw that you guys have a couple project, managers and then your director of operations. These are typically people whose input when we got a ABC construction company, they were aware of what that process looked like on a day to day basis with materials and how to monitor, etcetera. We definitely want their input. So as a next step, what I would recommend is that we can at least get those project owners involved in your director of ops. Is that something you think we can make happen? I'm sharing a story of a customer that has accomplished a good outcome by involving their team, and I'm using that as a way to sell the person on multithreading, but also as a way to pressure test their ability to get the introductions for that. If they aren't able to do that, if they're like, yeah, I don't really interact with those people, we could do one of two things. I could reach out to them directly and mention that we had a conversation, or we could try to work on something together for you to get an introduction. What would you prefer? I love that. That's so good. Because you're not asking permission to go them. You're saying, I'm gonna take one of these three routes. Phenomenal. Wish we could talk about this more, but we are running out of time, Jason. We gotta move to the final question, which I hope you know. We talked about a lot of really good habits salespeople should be exhibiting. Now I gotta flip it on his head and ask you about a bad habit. So the last question, what's one bad habit you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? I think one of the big things since we've been talking about competitors is this idea that there's too many companies. I call it drinking the company cool. So we're talking like that TCO play, for example. People are not going to move to your solution just because it's a category leader or because you have all these slick features and all this other kind of stuff. And it's kind of the same old stuff that we talk about in sales a lot. A lot of people just honestly spend all of this time in future and functions land. I wanna talk about impact. I wanna talk about business outcomes, like what you're trying to accomplish through the solution. If you had to have a conversation with a buyer and you could not talk about your solution, what would that sound like? Or really talk about the impact and the outcomes that this person cares about and the problems that they're having. You really need to push yourself to be able to have conversations at that level. Phenomenal. Jason, thank you for joining us yet again. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It is time for a two by two recap from this episode with Jason Bey. What do you have for your two? So the first one is in a rip and replace deal, one of the first questions you should ask is why did they bring on the solution they have in place to begin with? This helps you understand the problems they were looking to solve, their motivations, etcetera. It's a great early question to ask in rip and replace deals. My next one is in deals where you're up against competitors to win the business, you should be testing your champion late stage in the deal to determine if this were up to you and just you, would I be the choice you're going with? If the answer is yes, you can use that to get them to coach you on how to beat the competition and to ask stuff like, okay. Like, I know I'm gonna be presenting next Thursday. I'd love to get your take on the things that I should be showing and talking about to differentiate from the competition to make sure that I really wow the room. Get them on your side of the table and give you some inside baseball. Number three. If they're about to look at those competitors and you haven't won them over yet, you wanna give them things to look for that the competitor doesn't do. The example that Jason gave is he tailors his training content really well. He told them, hey. Don't just take it at face value. Why don't you ask them to actually pull up one of the emails that they've tailored for one of their clients, and oftentimes, they won't be able to do that. Lastly, number four. If you wanna sell a rip and replace deal, you can't just have nice to have feature differences. You need to have product gaps that lead to massive business impact, and then you need to get that impact in front of power and make sure that power actually cares and is willing to go on this massive journey of a rip and replace. Otherwise, move on to other deals. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So you and I, Armand, recorded a playbook on how to crush your competitors, and we'll put a link to that episode in the show notes so folks can listen to it easily. If you like this episode, I think you will enjoy that one. We went through an entire clinic on taking down your competitors. Anyways, thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
