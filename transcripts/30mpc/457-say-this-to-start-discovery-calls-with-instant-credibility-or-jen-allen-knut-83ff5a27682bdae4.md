## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my host, Nick Sigelski, and I'm here with our former cohost, Jen Allen. Folks, if you are not familiar with Jenn Allen, she previously was a guest host on thirty minutes to presidents club. She was also previously the chief evangelist over at Challenger where she sold massive enterprise training deals. She also is head of growth over at Lavender, and now she's the founder at DemandGen doing big box enterprise sales trainings. And this episode is all about big box enterprise sales. Nick, why should people listen? So Jen takes us through how to beat your prospects to the punch in kicking off your discovery calls to steer, to guide, to even control the conversation, to get them talking about the problems that you can actually make go away as opposed to unnecessary fluff. From there, we talk about actually why it's in your best interest to reaffirm that the way they're doing things today actually is a pretty good way to be getting the job done as a way to open the door for you to say, but here's another way that you actually might consider changing things. And then we also talk about how you can get somebody to explain what your prospect actually does to you as if you were a third grader. Yep, Nick. Sounds like this one's for you. And a three, two, one. Let's roll. Today warms my heart because we've got Jen back on the show. So, Jen, let's get your top three actionable takeaways. K. Tip number one is explain it like I'm 10. And the goal of this is to be able to truly understand the problem your customer solves for their customers. So to do this, I use a chat g p t prompt. You gotta use the paid version where I just ask it to say, explain the problem that Acme account solves like I'm 10. The reason I do this is because if I go to the customer's website, it's often full of tons of buzzwords and big words that I don't understand. When I go to ChatGPT and I ask it to explain it like I'm 10, what it does is it gives me analogies. You'll see it uses a lot of Lego analogies, which help me truly get to the root of what is the problem that they are solving for their customer, which in turn gives me context to figure out how the problem our solution solves might be playing out for their business. You know, Arman has been doing the same thing with every text message I send to him. He's trouble understanding basic English and says he always uses words like inoculate, which is not a third grade work. It's just not. You're right. Alright, Jen. What's number two? Tip number two is understanding your customer's problem thresholds. What I mean by that is figuring out what is it that makes customers no longer want to tolerate the problem that your solution solves. So the way that I do it is I'll go back to discovery calls from customers who ultimately bought. They don't even have to be my discovery calls. They could be from someone else on the team. What I'm especially looking for are similar in kind discovery calls. So if I'm selling to Omni Hotels and we have Marriott as a customer, I'm gonna pick that one over everybody else. And the reason I'm going to those is to listen for the specific language that the customer uses to describe why they reached out now and why they took this meeting and why the problem that we solve is no longer tolerable. So, specifically, to give you an example, I think a lot of us who sell into the sales buyer hear that our customers or our prospects would like to build more pipeline. But where I would much rather get closer to the problem is hearing what is driving that need for more pipeline. Is it more competitors? Is it we're not seeing the conversion rate that we have expected or seen in the past? So I'm looking for problem specificity so that I can mirror that in other customers who bring that same problem statement. Very nice. Round us out. What's number three? Number three is focusing on the before in your customer case studies. Specifically, what I mean here is I think most case studies, when we use them as sales, we use them to show impact of our solution. To me, one of the better opportunities is to look for in the before section, which just usually just labeled before, how is it that the customer is describing the problem? So for example, one of the clients I work with sells into aerospace engineers. And one of the metrics that they work on for their customers is reducing aircraft on the ground or AOG. And so in the before part of the story, what they're talking about is reducing AOG costs, so downtime of a plane being on the ground. When I know that, I can more effectively hypothesize how the problem that they solve might be playing out in their business. Alrighty, Jen. So we're gonna talk about building a problem point of view and then taking that into a discovery call. So let's go back to that tip number one, which is asking ChatGPT to explain the problem the company solves like we're 10. What's an example of something that ChatGPT would spit out? And then what do you do with that? Most of the time and this is where you can play around with age. I always start with 10, and if it's extremely basic, I'll jump it up to 12 and max 15. So just play with the age because sometimes it's overly simplistic. But Like I said before, a lot of times they'll give you analogies that a kid would understand. So Legos are a big favorite of ChatGPT. So I remember there was a company in a highly technical space. I went to their website. I didn't have a freaking clue what they were talking about because I needed a dictionary to define every term. And then I went to ChatGPT and asked this question, and they described it in a way where they talked about data, unstructured and structured data for an organization, which candidly made no sense to me when reading their website. But they gave the analogy of if you dumped out a big box of Legos, you had the instructions to make something, but everything was in disarray. It would take you so much longer to be able to build that final product. And so the analogy drew on the fact that if you had instead of just dumping it out like most kids would, if you had taken it out section by section, kept the Legos in the boxes or the bags, it would have been far easier for you to quickly start that project and finish that project. That made way more sense to me than trying to read a bunch of highly technical terms. So once you have that, now you understand Legos in the box, not in the box. How are you using that as a seller? I had a really great manager who I always talk about, Kevin, who told me that if you don't understand what this company sells, who they sell it to, how they sell it, and how they make money, you don't know enough about this account to have a deal. You have an opportunity. That always stuck with me. The way that I use it is because if I take, for example, what I sell so I sell sales training. There's a million sales trainers that exist out there. When I am preparing for a call, I can't just go in and talk about generating more pipeline and converting more pipeline and selling enterprise deals because that makes me sound like everybody else. Instead, what I have to do is I have to come to that call with some sort of hypothesis around how a specific problem might be contributing to a larger objective or hurting, actually, a larger objective. And so in order to do that, I have to understand what is it that this company is solving for their customers because that helps me understand what in turn they are selling to their teams, which in turn gives me ideas around problems that might make it harder to do that. The second reason, obviously, I sell to sales buyers and marketing buyers. But even if you're selling to a highly technical you know, let's say you sell to a CIO, companies only exist to make money. When you follow the money trail, that's when you can start to find places where processes, frameworks, structures, things might be broken, which anytime something starts impacting the company's ability to make money, those are usually the things that get focused from executives. And so if I'm not looking at their business through their lens and what they're trying to do, it's really hard for me to start to hypothesize what problems I might be able to solve with my solution. And in turn, I just end up speaking generically and say things that mean pretty much nothing to anybody. Could you give me an example of maybe for, like, a recent deal or recent couple deals you've had of what those hypotheses actually sounded like? And then we can reverse engineer the things that you did to get to that. Because my guess is you're not just doing a chat GPT prompt. There was a company that I was selling into that sells into professional services firms. So this is a early stage deal. I know from the prompt that their unique audience is professional services firms. That's very different than if they're selling into big corporate entities, obviously. So that prompt allowed me first and foremost to understand who is their customer. The second thing that I did is I looked at what is the solution that they have for their customers. That told me it's basically a CRM. Now knowing that tells me that they are probably in a highly crowded space where they're competing against really big players like Salesforce, HubSpot, others, and they're probably fighting for market share. That allowed me to say, gosh, if I was a seller and I was working in their business, what would make my job really hard? Well, it would be how do I pick up the phone and call a customer and get them off of a Salesforce knowing that, like, Salesforce is often the thing that no one gets fired for buying. That tells me it's probably not gonna be so easy to just churn through a ton of calls. I've either gotta think differently about my problem list or I've gotta think differently about building a message that would defeat a status quo incumbent. But that allowed me to come to that call and say, listen, I don't work there. I don't live in your shoes. But I was imagining what it would be like to be a salesperson. And it seems like from the outside, are you up against big, big behemoths like a HubSpot and a Salesforce? And it was like, there's this moment where they kinda, like, tilt their head, and they realize this is not another call where someone's just trying to push a product. It's someone who's taken at least a couple minutes to try to imagine what it's like for them uniquely in their business. So, Jen, let's keep taking it from there. It sounds like you're referencing your problem or your hypothesis pretty early in a discovery call. Is this literally how you're opening up, or when does this, like, fall chronologically on a discovery call? So I'll use an example of a call that I was on today. I think most customers or most prospects show up to calls expecting that they're gonna have to educate the seller on what they do. When I open it, I do my, like I'm I'm not a big small talk person because I'm awkward and weird, so I just try to get to business. If it's an inbound call, I'll say whatever I know from why they reached out. Sounds like you're looking to discuss x today. If it's an outbound call, I'll reference my message and say the reason I reached out is because. And then I'll pause and I'll say, but before we get into any of that, I was doing a little research. I don't claim to be an expert on your business, but one of the really interesting things I saw is it looks like and then I'll take what I learned from that prompt and one more prompt and try to anchor it on a higher order business objective. And I do that for two reasons. One, it helps I hate the word control because I'm not trying to control anyone in a sales call, but I think sometimes the wheels come off in the beginning and then we spend the rest of the time trying to get the wheels back on. It helps me get to a high impact conversation quickly. And then the second reason is because I actually wanna seek to be corrected very early in the call. One of the mistakes I made as a seller is being naive enough to think that just because I did some research on the Internet, like, I knew everything about their business and everything they were trying to do. So I'm actually framing it of, like, I'm not an expert on your business, but it seems like this is a big focus for the business. Now where am I off? What did I miss? And I think the sooner you can offer up yourself to be corrected, the sooner you create this environment where you're sparking a two way dialogue where someone feels comfortable telling you the truth instead of just passively being like, yeah. Yeah. That's fine. That's right. Okay. Yeah. Let's keep moving. It allows me to very quickly gauge, am I in the neighborhood of impact? Am I in the neighborhood of accurately guessing, like, what's most important to them? And if I get that completely wrong in the beginning, then it allows me to think in my head, like, how am I gonna pivot this call before I get really, really deep in the weeds on it? So there's actually a couple things that you're doing here that are really, really smart. The first thing is you are immediately moving the conversation from person has all sorts of questions about what your sales training is like, what it costs, how it's delivered, etcetera, and asking you about your products to you're saying, hey. I wanna talk about the problems first, and you're beating them to the punch of getting to a problem based discussion. The other thing that you're doing, and I I hear you on, like, the control piece. I think what you're doing is you're steering the conversation in the direction of a place that you can help because it's really, really easy for a prospect to babble for four and a half minutes about stuff that is totally unrelated to problems that you can solve. And so you are guiding. You are steering the conversation towards problems that you can solve. And then the last thing that you're doing, it's funny. We just recorded with KD, Kevin Dorsey, and he talked about this concept of correct and confirm. And what it is is anytime you present a hypothesis, what's going to happen with the prospect is they will either confirm, yeah, Jen, you got it a 100% right, or they will correct you and tell you where you are wrong. But if you just asked, tell me about your biggest problems with selling, they're gonna be like, great generic question where she's just trying to tee me up to sell me. Now you said something that I think a lot of folks might have glazed over, which was you said you're trying to anchor this to, like, a problem of a higher order or something like that. Could you maybe go a little bit deeper on what you meant by that and what that actually sounds like? Yeah. So I think this is born out of, again, having sold to salespeople. Sales organizations, no matter what industry, are not that different in terms of what they're trying to do. Like, it's rare to meet a company who doesn't wanna sell more, sell more profitably, and sell more using less. It's very easy to get pulled into those zones. What I'm looking for is I'm trying to get high in terms of why are they looking to sell more, and then I'm trying to get low in terms of specificity of how and what they're trying to get to. So to give you an example, the other chat g p t prompt I use all the time is who is the CEO of x company, and what are their most recent interviews about the company's growth strategy? The reason I do that is because if I can start the conversation with something that the CEO is talking about, that I think in turn makes it easier for the sales cycle to move later versus if I start down here with, oh, this process sucks and I don't like it, and then I have to elevate it up, feels like there's more drag on that route. You all know I love Nate Nisraala. Nate Nisraala did a post a couple weeks ago and he quoted a Reid Hoffman quote, which said, as a CEO, your number one job is to decide which fires to let burn. And why that relates to this conversation is in every business, there's problems. There's an endless amount of problems, an endless amount of things that are broken, but they don't resource them all. And so if I don't attach up here to a higher level business objective, then I might spend a lot of my time trying to, you know, put out a fire that the company is totally fine letting burn. I think it's really important to both think about the anchor points of high. What is the business trying to achieve? And that's what I get from that chat GPT prompt. And then, Lo, what is that underappreciated root cause or driver as to why the problem is as big as it is today? You talked about, in the prep, making sure that you don't just sell. We need to generate more pipeline as the thing they're trying to achieve. You need to get much more specific to make sure that your solution is actually moving needle on that goal. Could you talk about how you actually do that in a discovery call? I think you talked about figuring out what they're trying to achieve and what might make that hard is what you were describing. I don't believe in scripts, but I do believe in I learned this from Challenger. Like, having a choreography to the call so you can, like, move and dance and things go a different way, but you know where you're going. You know what your guideposts are. So the way that I do it is in the beginning of the call, I'm doing what we just talked about. Like, I'm anchoring on, do I understand what the company is trying to achieve? Then step two is then I'm getting into how they appear to be solving for it today. So if I'm working with a big public company, I can often find this stuff either in investor relations reports, investor reports. Sometimes, like, the executives post about it. You know, we wanna grow x percent in the enterprise segment. Here's how we're thinking about it today. If it's a private company, I might have to kind of make an educated guess. That's why I'm falling back on some of that work that I talked about, like, looking at your case studies and looking at other customers that were like them to see how others approach it. My second step there is to say, you know, it sounds like you're trying to get to this. Seems like this is the reason why. Where am I wrong? Now I'm saying, one of the things I've seen in doing research on the business is it appears that the business is focusing on a couple things to get to that objective. If it's not public and I don't see that in public information, I'll swap that out with, now I don't know how you approach this, but when I work with companies like a, b, and c, similar companies, some of the most common ways I see them trying to approach this is through a, b, and c. And I say, but how are you different? Help me understand, how is it different for you? And at every turn, what I'm looking for is that correction because a correction is discovery. Right? When they correct me, now I know more than I did in my own research. Can you give examples of what a, b, and c might have been in that statement you had earlier? So I'll give you an example from one I did last week. It was a company that was trying to go from 8,000,000 to a 100,000,000 in a defined point in time. And in doing the research, what we saw is one of the marketing leaders was talking about a few of the big bets they made in 2024. So they talked about increasing paid ads. They talked about redesigning a website, and they talked about bringing on a new member of the team. That gave me an understanding of three things they invested in. So that would give me confidence to say, now from the research I saw, it looks like y'all have tried to bring in more revenue by redesigning the website, by investing more in paid ads, and by, you know, hiring a new member on the team to focus on demand gen. But one, did I get anything of that wrong? And two, what else am I missing that I didn't see in my research? In the worst case scenario, you're demonstrating that you've seen other people in this situation before, and you're demonstrating the fact that you're able to pattern match and you're coming off as an industry peer. In the best case scenario, you're able to identify two or three things that were already on their list. Now that they've started to tell you, let's say could you give an example of, like, what they would say in terms of, like, here's how we're trying to solve that and then where you would take it from there? So let's say they say, yep. Those are three things we're doing on the marketing side. We're also doing some things on the sales side. Now this is when I've got to shut up and just be like, Great, tell me more. What does that look like on the sales side? Listen, actively listen, ask questions as they go if I don't understand it and I don't want to underplay that. I've been in this space for twenty one years and I still don't know half the time what people are talking about. I don't wanna make myself sound like a moron, but I think it's perfectly okay to be like, I don't understand what that means, especially now when people are messing around with new AI and technology. Slow it down and be like, sorry, can you go back a step that I'm not familiar with that. What does that mean? People are happy to correct you. I'm seeking to understand what else I missed. And now I'll start to say that my third step here is one of the reasons I hear so many other organizations taking that same path is because and then now you're gonna empathize with why status quo, the way that they're solving the problem today, is good enough. Now, the reason this is so important is like a psychological thing and I learned this from Brent Adamson, the Challenger Sale author, and he said, psychologically, before you tell someone that they're wrong, first you wanna tell someone that they're right. If I say, hey, I see you doing a, b, and c, and then they say, yes, that's right. And I'm like, well, the reason that's not good enough is because now all of a sudden we've got this weird offense defense dynamic. Versus if I say, gosh, yeah, you know, we've seen a resurgence in people investing in paid ads and I took a look at your website and I don't know what the one before looked like, but the three things I really liked about it were this, this, and this. I can see why that has probably been beneficial to the business. And then you get someone feeling like, okay, you're not like immediately cutting me down, maybe they speak about, yeah, and this is what we're particularly proud about. That I think makes it safer and easier for me then to transition to step number four, which is then saying, you know, one of the things we were really surprised by is blank. And blank is whatever the thing is that you think they might be missing or undervaluing. So as an example, to be specific, we see a ton of companies investing in ABM, and that's awesome. ABM is an awesome thing. But one of the things when you look at the seller side is we were surprised to see that sellers don't always action some of these MQLs and SQLs that come out of that motion. But I don't know what it's like for your world. What are you seeing there? The idea is, like, you wanna celebrate that they're taking this path, but you wanna find a but or an exception, and then test the waters to see, are they different? Is their circumstance different? And if they're like, we don't see that here. Dig into it. I see that quite commonly. Can you talk to me a little bit about what you're doing differently? And it's okay to sit there for a second because what you're doing is you're gathering insight on current state, and that's gonna help us shape what we need to break in order to move them off of current state. So to recap, you go from what are you trying to achieve, what are the different ways you're trying to solve for that thing, you compliment them on things that are working, and then you're sort of being like, I was surprised to not see this. So One correction. We were surprised, and it's minor. But if I say I'm surprised, I'm judging you. If I'm like, you know what's really interesting is we were surprised when we talked to other companies to hear that or to see that. Now all of a sudden, it's like we're on the same side of the table. I'm not saying, hey, moron. You should know this and you didn't. I'm surprised I don't hear this. It's like we were surprised collectively when we worked with organizations that something was broken there. Sorry, Anna. You and the other customers you were working with were surprised Yeah. To see we were doing these things, but this problem here was still happening. By the way, Jen can help with that problem. So that was gonna be my question is that's probably where you're steering them to the types of things you can help with. Could you unpack that a little bit? Because while I'm sure you help with all types of sales training, my guess is you can't help with every single thing a sales org is working on. So how do you start to, like, steer them into your winning zone or the things that you can actually help with? So before I ever talk solution, what I want to do is to narrow them in on an underappreciated problem and then get them to size it. So like the next step before solution is, I might say, one of the things we were really surprised to find is that when an organization looked at all this pipeline they've been building, they were still seeing a really low conversion rate. So I'm not sure what your conversion rate is, but one of the things that was an unanticipated competitor was not the ability to build pipeline, it was actually the ability to convert it late stage. And what's interesting is when you look into that, there's a really common culprit for that, which is something called buyer status quo. Now buyer status quo is my niche. Right? Like, I sell to companies who say they lose to customers being like, we've got a good enough way. So that's my niche. So what I want them to do is really size the problem of status quo. The issue is most companies don't look at their pipeline like that. They look at closed loss deals through budget and timing and not responsive and competitor win. So, what I'm asking them to do before I get to solution is I'm giving them a way to size the problem where they're the ones that hit the enter button. When they come in and they say, you know, we're not converting or we're not building enough pipeline, I'll say, you know, it's interesting. When I'm working with a lot of companies, one of the exercises I have them go do is go back to your CRM, go back to all the deals that were closed lost last year. And then I don't know how your closed lost reasons are set up, but pull out for me if you don't have one for status quo, which most don't. Pull out for me unresponsive timing and budget. And then I want you to tally up what are the total costs for that, like, the total pipeline value for that. And then, like, come back to me tomorrow and tell me what the number was. Well, I know that in most cases, it's always gonna be a bigger number than they thought it would be. I had one last week that was 53,000,000. I had one the week before that was, like, 84,000,000. Now, what they've done is they're like, Wow, we've got a $50,000,000 status quo problem. What do we do about it? And that's the dynamic in a call that I want. So sometimes we can do it in the moment. It's rare. I'm okay with them going back, doing homework, and coming back because usually they're excited because I'm activating something called perceptual curiosity. Perceptual curiosity is like when something doesn't jive with the way that you look at the world and it's almost like an itch you need to scratch, like, they wanna go and scratch it not because I'm telling them to, but because they're motivated to be like, what's that number? So then they come back, and now they've got a problem size. And now they're pulling me in to say, you were the one that illuminated the size of this problem. What do you know about how companies fix it? And that's the dynamic I want, Nicole. I want them pulling for me instead of me desperately grabbing on to them. I'm wondering if you can speak to that a bit because I talk to a lot of new sellers, and I think a common mindset of folks that are maybe a bit greener to sales is that your job is to be as helpful as possible and be in service of the customer. And the thought of assigning homework to an already extremely busy leader feels preposterous. And so I'm wondering if you can speak to the dynamic and what's going on there and maybe, like, your even your status in that situation? It comes back because we started the conversation around what they are trying to do, their ultimate business objectives. And by the end, where we are right now, what I'm doing is I'm trying to give them a way to have that moment. So it is in service of the business objective. That's why this doesn't work. If you just go in and say, oh, you're looking to build pipeline, like, go do this math. They have to believe that you've taken the time and you understood what the business is trying to achieve. And why I don't think it comes off as a rough ask is because it's in pursuit of finding another lever for them to pull. I think that's the place, particularly the higher you move up in an organization with an executive, they don't care as much about solutions as they do being the person that found that big insight that allowed them to say, we're gonna change our strategy, and this is what it's gonna look like. Once I figured that out, I realized anything I do that's in service of that is only helping them with the job to be done that they have. If I'm rushing the solution, that's helping me with the job to be done that I have. Well, Jen, the clock is ticking, and we gotta move to the final question. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing, and now I'm gonna flip that question on its head and ask you about a shouldn't. The last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? If you are selling into mid market or enterprise, do not show up with your hands out asking your customer to fill out the answers to the test. It is massively unacceptable in the information rich era that we live in now to have done no research on what the business is working on. Like I said before, you don't have to be perfect. Do not let perfection be the enemy of progress. Don't feel like you gotta get it perfect. You just have to be specific. Come with a specific point of view. Do not be lazy because too many sellers are doing the work, and that's the one competitive advantage that we own is how we show up and how we sell. Amazing. Jen, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Jen Allen. What do you have for your two? The first one is explain it like I'm 10. So when you're trying to figure out what your prospect actually does and make sense of the jargon and the noise and the new AI workflow features on their website, Go to chat g p t, plug in the URL, and say, explain to me how this company actually makes money and what they do, like I'm 10 years old. Now if that's too simple, you can say, explain it like I'm 12, 14, and go up. If it's too complicated, go lower. Number two, beat them to the punch in the beginning of the call. What I mean by that is instead of saying, alright. Well, here's the agenda. Let's hear what your big problems are. Jen leads her calls by saying, hey. I was doing some prep for this, and I'm obviously not in your shoes. I don't know everything about your company, and I don't pretend to. But I was doing some prep for this, and I was thinking about, like, you all sell CRM to professional services firms, and I imagine that is a really, really crowded category and that you're usually having to try to, like, kick out pretty well established incumbents. So I guess I'm wondering if that might be one of the big areas you all are focused on or if I'm, like, totally off base with this one. What you do is you guide the conversation towards an area that you can help, and you also steer the discussion less about, oh, tell me about your product, what you cost, when can I see a demo, and instead towards problems? Number three. The way that Jen choreographs a discovery call is she starts by understanding what the prospect is trying to achieve, how they are trying to solve for that objective, and then from there, introduce something that surprised her or other customers that they might not be doing. And then lastly, number four, going back to the start of that discovery call. Jen will start a discovery call differently based on if it's inbound or outbound. So she'll either start it for an inbound lead by saying, hey. It sounds like you reached out because of x, y, and z. Or if it was outbound, she'll start by saying, okay. The reason that I reached out to you was because of a, b, and c. That gets the call started a little bit more quickly. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So if you like Jen's approach, you might also like some other content that we've done with her. We recently had her on one of our tactic tear down episodes where she talked through the seven different ways to gain group buying consensus. It's no secret that, like, there's more and more and more and more stakeholders in every single sale. And you typically need to win over all of those people or at least neutralize the people that might be red lights and get enough people to be green lights. Otherwise, your deal is going to stall and drag out forever. And so Jen has seven specific ways that you can move that deal to actually get it closed that she covered in a free 30 MPC workshop, and there is a link in the show notes for you to check that out. Give it a watch, give it a listen, and we will see you next week on the show.
