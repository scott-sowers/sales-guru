## Transcript

You gotta think about how am I going to make this worth the buyer's time even if they decide not to buy my product or service? That's how you can massively increase your reply rates. You want your prospect's time, but it's the worst thing to ask for in emails. Reply rates drop by 44% if you ask for time in cold emails. Good CTAs are 28% more replies. Offers outperform interest based CTAs by four x. An offer is not a demo, a gift card, or a coffee chat. Real offers that convert include easy, pitch the blind date, medium, one to many offers, hard, one to one offers, cold emails that give get replies. Since the economy has really tightened up, like, there was this, like, high in 2022, and then it's dipped since then. And buyer uncertainty has been in an all time high. People are less proactive about buying right now. So what does that mean? They're less responsive to cold outreach. They're taking meetings for the sake of, hey. There might be something better out there. Yeah. So we've all seen the statistic that, you know, 3% of your market roughly is in buying mode. So how do you engage that other 97%? Because there's a portion of those that would buy something if compelled to do so. So. How do you get them to take a meeting? You don't get them to take a meeting by talking about your solution as if they are already shopping for it. You gotta hook them with something that is actually valuable, and it's not talking about yourself, your company, or getting an introduction. The stuff that we've seen work really well, the easy stuff, the pitch the blind date is if you're my account executive, Nick, and you got six years of experience selling to VPs of manufacturing and I sell a welding solution, I'm gonna say something like, you know, if nothing else, I'll put you in touch with Nick, and he'll run you through some of the really hard to automate parts that I see that you guys are working on. And he'll talk about how some of your peers are dealing with a labor shortage right now. Like, that's a powerful reason to take a meeting. If nothing else, it's gonna be a good hang. I'm gonna talk to someone that really knows what they're doing. If you sell something technical, that's something you can implement right away. The other one I'll give you, these one to many offers are great. We're actually working with, one of our partners to do a really in-depth guide on connect rates broken down by persona. It's broken down by industry, by the day of the week, the time, etcetera. Like, that's a great give if I was prospecting. Right? Hey, Nick. We actually analyzed HR leaders, and we found a couple really interesting things. C suite is more likely to pick up the phone than a VP. Want me to send the rest over to you? I'd be happy to run through to Nicole. Like, that's a really good gift right there. So you can leverage these, like, one to many insights. So you gotta think about how am I going to make this worth the buyer's time even if they decide not to buy my product or service? That's how you can massively increase your reply rates and your win rate for that for that matter. When you start a sales cycle off with giving value like that, you immediately put yourself in this trusted advisor seat that everyone wants to be in, and you're no longer gonna be commoditized. If your only ask is, hey. Do you wanna take a look at this thing? If they're not actively looking to buy, 97% of people are gonna say, nope. And you're SOL, and you're gonna burn through your territory really, really fast because you're only talking to people that truly are in market to buy today. But you and I both know that when you actually have the chance to sit down with a customer and understand what's going on in their world and maybe even reveal problems that they weren't thinking about, you'll have people that weren't ready to buy that all of a sudden they're like, can I give you my credit card? And so Yep. Your job is to start conversations with them. And so you have to have a reason to have a conversation that is more than look at my product, come check it out. And what you're doing is you're saying, hey. Even if you don't buy, here's the value you're going to get out of a conversation with me. So what we're doing at thirty MPC when we're prospecting for new sponsors, literally, our CTA is, hey. We put together a couple different campaign ideas for how we can help amplify your new product launch or whatever we saw they're looking to promote. Are you open to us sharing those with you? And we already have a sense when we're reaching out. We have a pretty small account list. But, like, I'll be honest, Jason. When somebody says yes, then we're putting some more thought into, like, alright. Let's send something really, really good because that's one way to start a conversation. This is what executives love too. You're never gonna get a meeting with an executive by offering to give them a free demo. We won't? What about a $5 coffee gift card? Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
