## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost today, the one and only Galski. We have the one and only John Scherer as our guest. He is currently the COO at growth assistant. And before that, he was a super rising star over at Lattice, making VP of sales at a super young age, overseeing a team of 50 plus. And, oh, man, this is a hot one. Nick, why should people listen? So John is an extremely practical sales leader. And in this episode, he shares a lot of misconceptions that exist about running a sales org. Example, he thinks you should have a discount on every single deal to drive that deal. He talks about when he's running a sales org with 50 AEs, he's literally having a one on one with every single one of them. And he does it for a reason, and he does it in a very rhythmic way, which he'll talk about. So if you are interested in seeing best practice meet reality in this episode, you have a lot to learn from John. And a three, two, one. It's time to squeeze in some advertisements.

If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alrighty, John. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. Number one, the pipe squeeze. So for me, forecasting has two purposes, predicting and squeezing. We'll skip predictability. Let's talk about the pipe squeeze. So every two weeks, myself or the frontline manager, we spend forty five minutes with every rep walking through each of their deals. I have them bring all of their deals. I bring up my Gmail window. We go through each of them, and I ask five questions. How big is the deal? When are they going to buy? Is the prospect aware of that close date? What's the next step? And what's the incentive or discount? I type this out manually on the shared screen and I highlight red, yellow, green based on its quality. Then we forecast. Lastly, and hugely importantly, I then email this pipe squeeze to the CEO, to the CRO, to their peers, to the sales management team. And this is what makes the pipe squeeze a serious activity, transparency and accountability. Boom. What's number two? Alright. Number two is go absolutely ham on skip levels. So in my last role, I was a third line sales sales leader. So, basically, I had three directors, eight or nine sales managers, and about 50 reps under me. Every month, I did one on ones with the managers. Every week, I did one on ones with the directors. That's pretty normal. But what was the hack for me was that every quarter, I spent thirty minutes with every single rep. Why? Information. My job is to make decisions, and to make decisions, you need good information. I believe my primary job as a revenue leader is to make good decisions and undo bad decisions quickly. And a lot of times in these bigger organizations, what you're gonna find is Jason, the rep, is gonna give Carol, the manager, feedback. Carol, the manager, is gonna give Betty, the director, that feedback. And by the time it gets to me, it's filtered. Everyone's inherently biased, which is totally normal and okay. But as a sales leader who's making information based decisions, it's a pretty terrifying concept. And so by meeting with every single rep every quarter, I'm getting information firsthand, but I'm also opening the door for real time information to come to me. You just did a big resegmentation? Cool. You want Anthony to tell you how it actually went, what the reps are talking about? They need to trust you. That information needs to flow to you directly so that you can make decisions going forward. And the way to do that is getting really aggressive and consistent with your skip levels. Amazing. Bring us home. What's number three? Number three, career pathing. I call it microcareer pathing. So I have the belief that reps, top reps, are more motivated by career growth than they are by short term compensation. And so if you believe that career pathing ends up being your best lever to drive behaviors. In every organization, we want reps to hit goal, but there's usually something else that we care about, some behavior we really need to change. When I was at HubSpot, it was NDR. When I was at Lattice, I joined, we were eight percent outbound revenue, and we knew over a few years we needed to get to 50%. How did we do that? We built in outbound to career pathing. So, basically, you could hit a 100% for the forever at Lattice, but if you didn't outbound, you could never get promoted. And so what we would do is we would break down SMB, which we called commercial, into four career pathing levels, junior commercial, commercial, commercial, and even senior commercial or principal commercial if you didn't wanna go to mid market. But the only way to get that career growth was from outbounding. And we went from 8% to 50% over those two and a half years. It was a super successful program, and everybody learned to outbound. It was a cultural norm. So, John, one of the things you were telling us in the the preshow was we were talking about this pipeline squeeze. I wanna talk about this quite a bit. And you have a very, very intentional reason that those are the five questions that you ask. How big is the deal? When are they going to buy? Are they aware of that date? What's the next step, and what's the incentive? And those aren't like your traditional, like, MEDDIC or MEDDPIC fields that you might be talking about in one of these pipe reviews. Talk to me about the reason for those five questions. Yeah. I I think SMB mid market sales is a velocity game, and so it's all about speed. And I want reps to close deals really fast. And so the way to do that is to pick a close date with the buyer and give them a reason to buy on that close date and hold them accountable to it. I'm a huge believer in discounting. I want every single deal to have a discount on it. I think the reality is for most of us out here, the world isn't gonna end if somebody doesn't buy by a certain timeline. It's a very idealistic thing. Oh, we need a real reason for this date. Right? It's like, no. Give them a discount that expires on that date and drive the deal to close, and then you can move on to the next deal and get that brain space back. And that's the game that I play. I have one more follow-up question, which is, like, how do you explain these you've got a new rep or a new manager joining your team, and you want them to start doing these things. How do you explain the pipeline squeeze to them, and what do you teach them upfront about what goes into that meeting? I teach them almost nothing upfront. I bring them into the meeting. I put their deals on a list, and I start asking them questions. And I say, hey. When's this deal gonna close? And they're like, probably the end of the month. And you're like, is the prospect aware of that date? And they're like, no. Boom. Do you understand what I'm saying now? They're like, yes. Okay. I will ask the prospect if they actually can buy on that date. But why would they buy on that date? It's like, do you have a discount on that date? No. It's what's a good deal to offer them? Bring up DealDesk. And listen. This isn't the the sexiest, most thoughtful sales talk you're ever gonna hear, but I think this is the reality. And And at the orgs I've been a part of, which have grown rapidly and really successfully, like, this is the the base of the playbook. There are a lot of people in the audience right now who are probably cringing at the idea of discounting every deal. But I would ask yourself in a market like today, go look at every deal you've won and ask yourself, how many of those deals had zero discounts on them? And the reality is most companies are discounting most deals. I was doing velocity sales at Carta as well, and my entire team was selling 3 to $5,000 deals. And everyone was going to get a 20% discount if they just ask their law firm to refer them. And I knew any smart founder was gonna do that, and And so I'm like, if they're gonna do that anyways, I'd rather have them do it on my speed and my terms. But, John, I imagine that you have some reps who are like, I think this one's gonna close, or I think this one's gonna come in without a discount. Let's say you see a deal that has no incentive on it. How do you get your rep to slap a discount on it? My guess is it's not just a cold email saying, hey. 20% off today. Totally. It's a good question. And there is some nuance here. Right? Like, you've been on my team for twelve months and you're performing and you're like, nope. I'm not discounting this deal. Sure. Great. I trust you. Do your job. I'm not gonna beat you up about it. But if we're sitting here with a timeline that the prospect isn't aware of and there's no next step on the calendar and you need a reason to reach out to them, well, guess what? Everyone likes a deal. Let's get them on the phone. Let's get this thing moving. Time kills all deals. There's priorities that come in left and right. You don't get this deal closed tomorrow. It could be, like, perfectly boxed up. But guess what? Like, their boss leaves the company, and they go into a panic for a month. You lost the deal. Right? I don't wanna play that game. And so in order to avoid that risk, I would literally have the rep send an email saying, hey. My boss noticed your account, thought she'd be a great fit, wanted to know if you'd talk about pricing incentives with us. Get them on the phone, confirm that they can actually buy on the timeline, offer the deal, lock it in, move on. My question or concern even would be if I am a rep and I have an early stage deal, or even if I'm a leader and I'm poking a new reps pipeline, and I get the sense that it's not price that's gonna get this deal done. There are other issues. How do you suss out if giving them an incentive is going to actually get the deal done or if you're just gonna give a discount? And now the deal is not gonna close on time and it's discounted. It's a great question. So when I'm doing the pipe squeeze, I'm asking a little they're filling me in on context on the deal. What's the next step? It's not just when is the next step. It's what's the next step. And that is actually what typically reveals what's going on on the deal. Well, the next step is I'm meeting with the champion on Tuesday because they're talking to legal and procurement over here, and their boss looked at a competitor last week. If I hear those things, I'm gonna pause on giving the discount because that deal isn't late stage. We're not in a closing motion for that deal yet. And so what we're gonna do there is we're gonna discuss the next step. We're gonna walk through that and then design our cadence on what's gonna get us to a conversation that we're happy about. But if we get them on the phone and they tell us, hey. Yeah. We'd like really like to work with you, then I want a discount on the deal. Talk to me about the other elements of the pipeline squeeze. So you have these five questions, and then you mentioned that you're going to highlight the next step based on its quality, red, yellow, or green. How do you determine the quality of the next step? Green is the next step is on the calendar. I don't even care if you have a payment link out. If there's not a next step on the calendar, it's not green. There needs to be a calendar event out there. Red, you're chasing. Orange is they're reviewing the legal contract. They said they get back to me by Tuesday afternoon. I can see the email thread. It does say they'll get back to me by Tuesday afternoon with the calls and on the calendar. It's orange. What do you do when you see a bunch of orange on the calendar, AKA contract is out waiting for red lines. They said they were gonna get back to me. How do you act on those deals? So, typically, what I do is I make them come up with a cadence of today, I will call them at three. If they do not answer, I will email them at four. If they do not answer that, I will multithread in here. And I make them type all of or I'm typing that out. I walk them through it, and now everybody in the leadership team sees the accountability on that deal. Guess what? It all happens. I'm kind of interested in this philosophy of So you're on the pipe review with your rep. Right? You're both on a Zoom, and you can see each other's faces, and you go hold on. Let me share my screen. And you're literally pulling up your Gmail, and you are live taking notes on the deal in a in an email. I it sounds like. Why do you do that? One, it's to me, it makes us feel like we're all on the same team. I love it. I love being the typer and asking the questions and talking with the reps about the deal. It's like camaraderie to me. Pipe squeezes. This is absolutely my favorite meeting of the week. Right now, I'm managing two reps directly. And literally, the pipe squeeze, the highlight of every other week for me. They're forty five minutes. We rip through them. They're fun. I send the email out. The CEO asks questions on the email thread. They're like, oh, I know Dan at Athletic Greens. Let me send a note. It's actually great. Builds a lot of camaraderie, and I like the transparency and also being in that place of servant leadership. Like, I'm gonna type this up for you. Like, I'm here to support you in this. We're on the same team. Yeah. I like I feel like it also probably helps drive the conversation forward because you are the one being described. And, like, you can be like, alright. We finished talking about this piece. Let's move to the next part. I'm I'm actually gonna steal this because I run our customer success function at thirty minutes to presidents club, and I meet with one of my colleagues. We go through the health of every account, and it's very similar to a pipe review. And I'm going to start taking the screen share and going through and being like, nope. We're talking about this one now, and this is where we're talking here. I have a follow-up question, which is I might have misunderstood this email that you're sending out. I assumed that you were aggregating all 50 of your reps into one email that went out to CRO, CEO, etcetera. You're sending out an individual email to the entire company, including your CEO for each individual rep. Is that correct? So they're labeled April 29, pipe, squeeze, Brennan. What do they say? Does the CEO or the CRO say when they get 30 emails from the 30 reps at Lattice? Who doesn't love seeing that the deals are off? What's up with the deals? It's the best thing. Right? I think I think everyone's a salesperson or you gotta get them looped into the sales process. Nothing but good stuff. Obviously, it depends on your org size. Right? When I was at Lattice, I didn't have the CEO. On the pipe squeezes, it was going from rep to manager to director to VP and brought out to sales ops. Now I'm in a smaller company, and so it makes sense to, like, expand it all the way to CEO, etcetera. So there's a little judgment in there, but I try to maximize the transparency. How did this work when you were a VP? Were all of your managers doing individual pipe squeezes, and then you were the recipient of 50 different emails? It's great. And then I can reply to the email and be like, sick pipeline, Max. Like, dope. And then it's like a a positive culture thing. So other than sick pipeline, Max, dope, what are the other things that you would do when you would get those 50 different emails? You want me to list out the different emojis that I use? Yeah. No. Like, you'll sometimes you'll see, oh, this is not good. Right? And then I'm probably gonna ping the manager or the director and be like, yo. What's up with Carol? What's going on here? This is, like, two in a row. And it's also a great little data point. Right? We can all go into Clarity or Gong, whatever, and see our forecast in our pipeline. We all do that exercise upwards. Right? But this is, like, constant info of information. And like I said before, the skip levels. I'm just trying to accumulate information and trust that I'm filtering and gathering it and sorting it in a way that's gonna help me make decisions. One other thing on this, it reminded me of, oh, that's two weeks in a row. I oftentimes had a hard time tracking the changes in the pipeline. In other words, there was a deal that went backwards or a deal that got closed loss, and all of a sudden it's gone from the list. Are you tracking closed loss deals inside of the pipe squeeze, or how do you keep track of the deals that are disappearing or things that where the next step didn't happen? If I wanna if I wanna go through them, like, next steps are an issue. Right? This was a thing at Lattice for a while. We had a cohort of reps that we thought were using next steps well and were closing better and a few that weren't. And so we, like, did an analysis on on it. We figured out, yeah, it's super right. So we did improve next steps training. For me, it's it's the motion of this, the consistency of the operating rhythm, the conversation topic, the coming together to talk about the deals that drives the biggest impact. And it's too hard to manage, like, perfect follow-up in all these different places. And so I kinda let it be, but the information's there. So I have a a guy on my team. His name's Oscar. He logs every pipe squeeze in an Excel sheet. So if I wanna go back and look at it, I can see everything. I could pull the data on it, but I will probably do it less than once quarter and only if I'm like, something's wrong. The last step of the pipeline squeeze is you have the five questions, You have the quality of the next step, and then you're forecasting off this pipe squeeze. How do you forecast off of these hundreds of deals that are coming your way? Depends on the size of the org. So right now, I've got four sellers. Right? I'm literally looking at their pipe squeeze emails, adding them up, doing the math in my head, then I send my own email that that is not on them that helps me do my forecast. So I do it separately. So a little bit of a different game. When we were at Lattice, right, the you're you have so much more data to to play with on forecasting, and especially in our SMB and mid market teams. The way that we're forecasting is I always would say, I'm doing my job to the best of my ability when I don't know the name of one deal Because I know how much pipeline was added this month, how much new pipeline we're gonna create this month, what the close rate on that new pipeline is, what the close rate on the pull in pipeline is. And we were within 10% accuracy quarter over quarter for my entire tenure. I didn't even know the name of deals. Just an SMB mid market thing. Right? It's a sub 100 k deal, but it's different depending on org size. There are a couple of really interesting things that you mentioned. Let's start with the small org where you can see every deal. You mentioned that you're forecasting. Your reps are not forecasting. They're forecasting on the pipe squeeze email, but then I take that info and I reforecast it up. An example of why I do that. I am not gonna hold the rep accountable for what leads have not come in yet this month that are going to come in. I know that I'm gonna close 20% of my revenue from a deal that hasn't even shown up in their pipeline yet when I knew that first pipe squeeze. I am not holding them accountable to marketing pipeline because it's the marketing pipeline that turns fast, not the outbound pipeline. And so I take that up where I can do the math, and I can say no. I know we're gonna find six more deals. And so to me, those are different exercises. So this, I struggled with a lot at Pave because we had different segments. Some were transactional, create and close inside of month. Others were longer ones. So what you're having your reps do is you're having them each close their in pipeline deals or forecast their in pipeline deals. So if a rep has 10 deals, you're not forecasting what could come in. You're only forecasting those 10 deals. And then you're applying an increase on that based on what you know mathematically could come in for the rest of the month or the quarter. Can you talk to me let's say it's the halfway point of the month. How do you figure out what's left to come in out of vapor in the next fifteen days? I mean, one is you look at historical data. Right? So how many new first meetings am I gonna get on my reps' calendars in those fourteen days? Then you have to look at the cohort of the value of a meeting. So if I have one meeting or I have a 100 meetings, how many of them are gonna close in the first fourteen days? How many of them are gonna close in the first thirty days? How many sixty, ninety, whatever? And they probably ass and totes out to a hundred and twenty days or something like that in transactional. Right. And so, literally, I'm just taking that number, and I am chopping it at fourteen days. And I'm saying mathematically, I think I'm gonna do 72 meetings, and I'm going to get 9% of that revenue from that. So I'm gonna get 9% total of that number. So you basically take meetings multiplied by close rate, multiplied by the percentage of the revenue you get out in that time period. And the interesting thing is it's it's scary accurate. It's just in my whole career, that's worked. Things are pretty consistent. I wanna ask you a bit about your current situation. You've got four reps. You're communicating this forecast up to your CEO, I presume. And I'm wondering when you send that email or when you have that meeting with your CEO, what information are you looking to communicate with them? And then are there things you're hoping to understand back from your leadership about, like, how they're receiving the information or, like, how they're planning on growing other parts of your the org, like the cross functional element piece of it? What goes into the comms that go up? One, I just want them to know what's going on. I don't want them to have to ask me how are we gonna do this month. I think just being a pro, that's part of the game. Right? I wanna educate you before you have to ask me questions. I want you to trust me that I know what's going on and that I can forecast successfully. Specifically, there are two founders of the business that I'm in now, and they both are very well networked people. And we get a lot of leads through their social channels indirectly. So So they're not necessarily introductions, but the social channels drive a lot of leads for us. And so that means that the likelihood that one of them knows one of these one of the people at the companies that we're selling to is, like, one in four, maybe higher. And so I want them to see the teal so they know who I'm selling to so they can text their buddy Gary who works at x y z company, and that happens every pipe squeeze. Like, that's a constant motion for us. Additionally, Nick, like, what will happen is they'll get the information and be like, oh, I have questions about that. And then, like, all of a sudden, we're in our biz ops Slack channel, like, ripping through why the data is this and what happened last week and why this marketing campaign did this. It triggers a lot of separate conversation that leaves that email thread. Alright. Last thing on forecasting, John. So you have reps forecasting the deals they have. You have a mathematical forecast of everything that's supposed to come in. Could you talk to me about how much of the forecasting are you doing in period this month versus future months? In other words, what's the cadence around this month, next month, next quarter forecasting? I've put in a lot of these sales processes when I came into this business as a consultant earlier this year. And so we're you graduate. Right? It's like we did our first forecast meeting, and then we started logging in. We did our first pipe squeeze, and then we started logging in. You're growing up over time. And one of those ways that you grow up is the distance in which you're forecasting out. And so this is a business with a sub thirty day close rate or a sales cycle, so it makes all sense in the world to lock in on end month. Now we've gotten pretty good at end month, so the next place you graduate to is the quarter. And so we're just beginning to do that now. And with a thirty day sales cycle, right, you you can play out that whole cohorted math thing. And you can literally say, we got this many meetings last week. This is what I think it's gonna be like, etcetera. And that's gonna that's gonna drive off of meetings what you think is gonna happen. So call up to sixty days out, maybe up to ninety days out, but not with a lot of confidence. And then you have to forecast marketing, which is the layer that gets complex in in this environment. So it's we did a webinar earlier this month. We drove 900 attendees. Okay. I'm gonna do another webinar next month. How many attendees and how can I drive? And can I get the attendee conversion up? I get the attendee conversion up. How many meetings am I gonna get in May? The webinar's on May 20, and how's that gonna impact the May and then June. And so that that's where you end up going. Right? You just forecast your activities. And that's harder, but I don't like to spend too much time on it, candidly. I think it's a good exercise, but I think spending more than forty minutes on getting that right is I'd rather spend that forty minutes trying to drum up more meetings. So, John, let's zoom into the role of one of your managers at Lattice. You had almost 10 managers on their team. All every single one of them is doing these pipeline squeezes. They're reviewing the 30 deals, and you're in SMB sales. And so the reality is they can't be on all thirty, forty, 50 deals for all of their reps. And so how much of your manager's time is spent in the pipeline squeeze and looking at all these deals versus doing other things like being in one on ones, being on calls, etcetera. Pipe squeeze is obviously super important. One of one of my big beliefs here is I I want people to do the job the way that they feel most comfortable doing the job within some set of guidelines. And the beauty is you've got eight managers doing it slightly different ways. Like, you're gonna learn a lot about what's gonna work better in your organization. So I I do wanna provide a degree of freedom there. One thing that I'm a big believer in is pipe squeezes, deal reviews, they're not one on ones. The one on one is a separate meeting. It is the reps' meeting. It is a growth meeting. It is it is a meeting to support the human being. It is not another forum to talk about deals. Talk about deals all day. Right? But it's really important in my belief to hold space every single week. You do not cancel the one on one, and you hold space for that rep to bring up what's on their mind to you. We had one rep leave over three years at Lattice, one voluntary attrition, and I think this is a big part of it. You support the whole person. Another thing I'd say is this might be a little controversial. I love when my managers are in and on deals. You wanna rewrite emails, help somebody navigate that part of the process. You wanna be on closing calls? Hell, yeah. I love it. Obviously, if you've got eight reps and they've got 30 deals, you can't be on all of them. But the most successful manager rep pairings I see are the ones where the rep brings the manager on all their big deals. I love it. Two two heads are better than one, but I think it's a fantastic play, especially over the last few years. And as you go up to mid market, which I also managed at Lattice, same thing. Right? You got eight deals. Get on the deals. Hell, yeah. You got a great you got a great company that you're selling to? Get on the discovery call. Be there on the whole process. Obviously, don't, like, jump in and talk over the rep, but be a team. Plan together. Win these deals together. It's hard to win right now. No shame in co selling top to bottom. Yeah. The three or four activities that any manager has are, number one, you work across deals. That's things like the pipeline squeeze. Number two, you work in deals, and that's being on the calls. Number three, you work directly with your reps, and those are the one on ones. And then number four is you're working with the team. And those are team trainings, bigger development activities. But even just the pipeline squeeze in the one on ones, if you have eight reps on your team, that's 16 meetings in a week. That's a lot. And then you add customer calls on top of that. That's a lot too. Whatever sliver's left, you should probably, one, have a little bit of breathing room to do some deep work so you can think about the best way to develop the whole team. But I love the way that you broke that down. John, this has been a freaking awesome episode. We have to move to the final question. We talked about a lot of good habits, admittedly controversial ones. It's time to talk about a bad one. So what is one bad habit that every sales leader should break so that all teams out there get a little bit better? Close Slack when you're in a meeting with another person. It's obnoxious to be Slacking while you're in a meeting with somebody. It's not cool. We can see your fucking eyes. I can hear your typing. It's not cool. It's a bad practice. I've been called out for it in the past myself by one of my managers, and I'm really happy he did. And it was embarrassing, and I feel like I'm a better leader because of it. Stop slacking during your one on ones and calls with other people. Could not agree more. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, Nick. It is time for a two by two recap. What do you got for your two? Alright. So number one, when you are in the pipeline squeeze, you should be the one scribing. Share your screen, open up your email, and you should be the one writing to help drive the meeting and show where you're gonna get in the weeds and the details and where you can skim over things. This allows you to stay in control, and it also saves you time. You don't have to write this stuff from scratch when you get out of the meeting. Number two is discounts drive velocity. When you are reviewing a deal that you want to accelerate, first, you need to ask the questions to figure out, hey. Is a discount even going to get this done? Because if it doesn't, you shouldn't just throw one over the fence. But if the answer to that is yes, meaning giving a discount could help speed this deal, then you should go and discount. Time is what kills most deals more than anything else. Doubling down on the pipeline squeeze. You're gonna ask the same five questions every time, rank the quality of their net red, yellow, green, forecast off the pipeline squeeze, and then send that email to the CEO for every single rep. And then lastly, number four, for the forecasting portion, you should only have your reps forecast their deals that are in pipeline. And then for everything that could be created and closed within the month or the quarter, you figure out the mathematical equation for what could come out of thin air. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Arman, this was such an exciting interview. I was gripping my desk with anticipation and excitement. And so if you wanna see me gripping my desk, believe it or not, thirty minutes to president's club is now on YouTube. So if you want to actually watch us interview the guest, it can sometimes be helpful because you can see body language. You can see people explain concepts. You can learn a lot from watching. Oh, man. Armond is flexing right now. So if you wanna see how much smaller Armond is than me, I'm trying. Check this one out on YouTube, and we'll see you next week on the 30 MPC Leadership Show. You'll see the truth.
