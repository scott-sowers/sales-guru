## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this Playbook episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my cohost, Mark Cosclo. And folks, we are still in the studio live, and we are doing a series of leadership playbooks. And I'm personally extremely excited for this one because I don't think I've ever met anyone other than Marc who has literally taken an organization from zero to a $100,000,000 ARR leading the whole sales org, very rarely can someone even stretch across all of those phases. And even if they can, very rarely are they actually there through all of those phases. So if you're not familiar with Mark, he was Outreach's first hire ever, and then he led them all the way through as their sales leader through a $100,000,000 plus in ARR. So we're going to break down each of the key phases from 0 to $100,000,000 in ARR. How the role of a VP of sales, CRO, head of sales, or first sales hire changes in each of those phases. And then we'll talk about the transitions. Where are those ARR milestones? When do those phases change? And then what are the things that you need to do to prepare yourself to enter each phase? Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. So, Mark, you described the 0 to $1,000,000 ARR bucket as the doer phase. Yes. Talk to me about what that means. So this mirrors my experience. And then, honestly, at Outreach, I had this amazing ability to meet with the best go to market minds almost every single day and talk to them about this kind of stuff. And this is collectively kind of how I define this. We're trying to find product market fit. So let let's talk about what's happening in a company from zero to 1,000,000. Does our product work? Product's on fire usually because of bugs and stuff like that. CEO is out there wondering, am I gonna get to my next level of funding? Like and what happens is is when you're brought in as that first sales hire, guess what your job is to do? To let those people do their job and you do yours. And so when you start to come into a company like this, if you're not a doer, then what you're gonna do is you're gonna ask other people to do stuff, and that's gonna take them away from the most critical thing that happens at this part of the company stage. Listen, sales is super important and that's the only way you get from zero to one is somebody selling something. But I would argue that, like, if the product team and the CEO and everybody get everything right, you don't need sales to be that huge of a part. And so you can't let it expand kinda beyond what you're doing. So let me give you a story at outreach. In the beginning at outreach, I would wake up at about 06:30 in the morning and I do a little bit of journaling and stuff like that. My first demo would typically be at 7AM. I would demo back to back half hour almost every single day without a break from seven until 04:30 or five. Like, literally, I don't know how many hours that is. Ten. I would do 10 20 demos in ten hours. So you There would never be a break. I I didn't eat lunch. It was just insane. Right? Now did I go complain about that? No. I just did it. Did I go talk to somebody about needing an STR now because I'm in deals? No. I just figured out how to keep filling my pipeline. I was a doer. You know what I did it from five to 10PM? That's when I took my kids to soccer practice. That's when I helped make dinner. That's when I cleaned up after dinner. That's when I and then at ten, I put my wife and my kids to bed. And then I would hit Salesforce. And from ten to 2AM, I get on my man, the phone with my man, Manny O. And Manny and I and I would build out Salesforce because I needed to quote the cash system. I needed this. I could have gone and asked somebody, but, no, I needed to do it. And did I have to watch dozens of hours of YouTube videos to do that? I did. But you know what? What happened in that time was Manny Medina, the CEO at Outreach, moved a little bit out of sales, and he started working on the vision, on the company, on the culture, on getting the right hires. And all of the rest of the company started to fill in because I was like, listen. If it has to do with sales, me. I'm your guy. I'm doing it. I'm not trying to find anybody else out to do it. I'm the doer. And if you can be that as a first sales hire kind of IC head of sales type of person, then you get the chance to make the next jump. But if you're not a doer, if you're a distractor, and I'm working with a couple companies right now that have their first doers. And I can see within a quarter, do I have a doer or do I have somebody that is actually further along in their maturity and acting in a way that isn't congruent with the company is right now? Don't forget your job as a sales leader is to meet the company right where they're at, but to be preparing yourself so that you're ready to take the leap for what the company needs next. Yeah. So a lot of times people come to me because I was first sales hire at Pave and led them from zero to 10, not zero to a 100. But in that zero to one phase, I don't think people realize what the job was. Yeah. The first job is you have to do the sales cycle. And what I mean by that is exactly what you described, like, the full sales cycle. So that means, like, you don't have an SDR. So I was doing a 150, 200 cold calls a week as the person who was closing all the deals and as the person who is expected to hire out the org. Yeah. So it's, like, just the other jobs that you start to do. A big red flag that I see that will tell me that someone's not a doer is when they come on board and they're like, how do I get SDR support? Yeah. Like, to me, that's a huge red flag. Or how do I get a sales engineer? I was like, sales engineer? Yeah. I was like, what? We might even make you code as an AE over here. I was like, what's a sales engineer? I was like, no. No. No. No. None of that stuff. That's number one. You need to do the whole sales cycle. Number two, you need to do everything that is required to support the sales cycle and the systems. So people don't realize, like, I literally had to go and buy Salesforce Yeah. And install sales Write your sales deck. Yeah. I'm like, oh, I gotta create my own sales deck. So I'm like, calling up we didn't have logos or I or branding or anything like that. So I'm like, look finding people on Upwork and Fiverr. Yeah. And I paid this guy, like, $20 in Pakistan to, like, put together, like, a our initial sales deck and all this stuff because we were, like, broke and bootstrapped. And, like, that deck took us literally from 0 to $2,000,000 of ARR. Yeah. Like, there was no one to do any of that stuff. So you have to be able to do the wholesale cycle. You need to be able to set up all the sales systems. You need to also be able to set up your sales process. Yeah. Yeah. I wanna talk about this for a second. I think one common mistake with early stage sales is most sales reps make a lot of money because they learn the sales process that your organization has given you Mhmm. And they learn the best way to execute that. In zero to one, you might not have the right sales process yet. You might not even know the right way to close a deal. You might not realize that if you don't get access to the CHRO by call two, that deal will never close. So can you talk about when you think about finding sales process market fit. Right? How do you go about figuring out what your sales process is going to be? Yeah. Well, I think that's part of the journey from zero to one. And and a and a doer is a rep that would do that no matter where they're at. Like, they're gonna take whatever is given to them and they're gonna make it their own and put their personal stamp on it. And I think this is just that to the max. Like, I'll never forget my first demo of outreach. It was literally, this is the home screen. This is a list of all your prospects. See this icon? It means this. And I literally took them through like it was some kind of technical walk through of every button and every icon. After two or three of those, I was like, wait. Stop. This isn't working. Let me let me go back to what I know. Right? And three or four iterations. And that's where you have to be so careful is you have to be able and willing to iterate. If you can't iterate, then you can't build the sales process because the sales process in the beginning, you're you're gonna start with a guess or a hypothesis or how you're used to doing it, and it's gonna evolve over time. And I think that that's another, like so how do you know you don't have a doer? One, one of the first things they ask for is for help. Like, that means you don't have a doer. Secondly, is they're not willing to change on the dime the minute that they find out something's wrong. That's another person that's not a doer. There's somebody that wants to be told what to do and what to change, and you can't have that from zero to one. Gotta have somebody that is willing to do it all themselves, and they're, self aware enough to know I need to change and are and are able to do it. That's one last key thing as I remember we had our discovery trees where we had this is the situation the prospect is in. This is the problem that we think they have, and this is the impact of the problem. And what we would do is every single time we couldn't get someone down that tree, we would, like, draw it on the board, and we'd be like, what question did we ask that pissed off the prospect? Mhmm. Like, okay. What are seven different ways that we could ask that question instead? If we're not getting any of the right answers, then maybe we have the wrong problem tree entirely. And we need to realize that this actually isn't the problem that people wanna solve with us. And so let's let's get out of the doer phase. 0 to $1,000,000 in ARR. You're mostly doing all the stuff on your own. Talk to me about the transition to the builder phase, which is 1 to 10,000,000 in ARR. Yeah. So the builder phase is when you're gonna start hiring people. It's when the numbers get so big and there's so much there the complications starts to add up and the process starts become repeatable. That's when you get to add in people. And so often, like, that's not when people add in people. They start right away. Alright. Let's get somebody in here. Okay. They've sold a couple deals. Let's hire somebody else. They'll sell twice as many deals as if we have two people. And really what you wanna get to is the place where, alright. I can see and explain. And we talked about this in our leadership, our sales manager thing. How do I know how to explain what I'm doing? And until your first sales hire does that, then you need to be very careful about hiring more people into. Otherwise, you're gonna have two people trying their own thing in another separate way. Right? So a builder's main job is start to build up the foundation of people, process, and systems that on which you're gonna start to build the rest of the org. The builder still, like, you know, like your contractor, like my contractor. If he asked to, he'd go do the drywall. Right? If he asked to, he'll go, like, take the toilet off and replace the wax ring. But you know what? He really has other people that kinda do that stuff. But so you still as a builder, you still got a hammer on your tool belt. You're still gonna have to do deals. You're still gonna have to have partly a number. I had a number at outreach till probably, like, 5 or $6,000,000 of what I needed to contribute. So you're still doing the job, but you're adding this extra layer on, and you're starting to hire other doers. And this is one of the key concepts of this model is, when you progress to one level, your job is to hire the the backfill, the hire that you just left. So when you go from doer to builder, as a builder, you need to go hire doers. Don't hire other builders. Don't hire people that won't be doers because when there's only three of you, you all need to still be doers. Right? So builders job is to hire doers and to make sure that they set in place the foundational processes, systems, and people that, like, get the sales org some momentum. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. So I've seen a lot of people make the mistake of they sub themselves out of too many things too quickly. Yep. And they also sub themselves out of the wrong things Yeah. Too early on. And so could you talk about what were your first couple of hires at Outreach once you reached about a million in ARR? And what were the things that you chose to get off your plate versus keep on your plate and stay keep your hands in? So we had an amazing sales velocity at Outreach. So I did a million bucks in about six months of the and so it was quickly becoming apparent that, like, I couldn't do it all myself because I was having so many meetings and so many leads. So we went really aggressive with our first hire. We hired four AEs and four SDRs all at once. Alright? Yeah. Now why would I do something crazy like that? Well, first of all, like, didn't know what I was doing. Probably wouldn't have done that again. Right? But I would say that there was some thought behind it in that three of the four AEs were close personal friends that I had worked with for years, and the other one was a super strong referral from somebody that, like, I completely trusted. All four of those reps stay with me for four plus years. Wow. And one of them is still there as one of the top AEs at Outreach. So, that kind of allowed me the the SDR org. We we did a great job hiring there and, again, hired a lot of people that we knew late thirties, early forties, more mature people for sales job and just, like, train them the right way. So, that's kinda how we started. I don't think that that should be a typical way that you start. But what you should make sure that you do as a sales leader as far as, like, what am I gonna keep and and what I'm gonna do is your job is just, like, slowly move out. So in the beginning, when you hire that first person, you do everything together. It's tag team. They're with you. Batman and Robin do your thing. Once you get that person to a level of competency where they can handle some things, then that's when you start to back yourself out and work on the stuff that surrounds that. So for example, let's say that you get them really good at discovery calls. That's your chance now to go, let me figure out and write my manual on discovery calls. Let me go ahead and build this deck and lock it in. And in this phase at outreach, by the time we got to about two or 3,000,000, I had written a 107 page sales manual. That was everything from these are the technologies you download. This is how to install them and these are the settings that you set up to. This is how you run a discovery call. This is how you do negotiations. And that's because I took each part of the sales process and what my reps were doing as I watched them. And I'd be like, alright. Let me go sit in the corner here for an hour and bust this part out. And I just made sure that, again, I kept my doer hat on, and I just went and did it. I didn't hire an enablement person. I just did it, but it was building the org. So that's why it's important to make sure that you don't move too fast out of one section to the next, because you still need to maintain some of that doer quality early on. I think one thing that's really important is anytime you leave a room or anytime you're leaving a set of duties, you've gone through all of the shit of figuring out the right and the wrong ways to do it. And in the early stages, it's like, it's half part skill, but it's half luck in trying enough things to make sure that you're not making the same mistakes. So if you spent six to twelve months selling this thing and you figured out every single reason the deal dies, and then you're like, alright. I'm not gonna sell deals anymore. If you don't document all those reasons that a deal dies, all of the sales processes you've taken, all of the different steps within the call, all the stories you tell within within a demo, what you're doing is you're literally resetting the clock on the next rep because you're still in the early stages. You're restarting the clock on the next rep, and now they need to go and figure out all that stuff out themselves. And so as you go and you take a step back, you need to make sure that you document the stuff along your way, and then you stay close to them. So you're watching the calls. You're staying on these calls. You're not just, like, saying, like, okay. There's someone else to do this job. I don't have to do this job anymore. Yeah. Process makes you great. Documentation makes you legendary. And so don't shoot for greatness when you can be a legend. Like, just take the time to document it out. And more importantly is, like, don't leave everything. Like, your job isn't to I remember somebody used to tell me, well, my job is to, like, make myself hire myself out of a job. And that always never quite made sense to me. Because what it says is, like, I'm gonna hire somebody, then I just I'm out of that now. And at this crucial phase when you're starting to go from product market fit to, like, alright. We can actually scale. There's so much that needs to be done that you still have to have a little bit of your doer hat on. You can't just go straight to builder. 100%. Just as a parallel example, I didn't hire four and four. That would be bonkers. But I did hire two and two. Yep. So we hired two AEs and two SDRs because oftentimes hiring reps in pairs is really helpful because if you only hire one, you never know if it's just them or the product or something else that's causing an issue. But then two, you get that healthy competition. You also get out of the echo chamber of your own thoughts when you're selling alongside someone. So hiring pairs is one other thing. So we hired two AEs, two SDRs, and one RevOps. And that early RevOps hire was super, super, super helpful for the business. Just getting basic things in place, like having an opportunity object set up the right way, having the entire total addressable market uploaded in the Salesforce, making sure that if someone wanted to pull a report for all of the companies that had funding in a certain time frame, all of that data was actually in our Salesforce. Getting that set up on day one, it would it made it so that we could have the output of 10 reps with a five rep team because rev ops was doing all the stuff to make all the reps faster. Rev ops, that's a learning that I've taken with me. The very first hire I did when I went to Catalyst was I hired a rev ops person. Like, that it's a it's a cheat code. That should be probably your first hire in most cases. So don't underestimate the power of rev ops. Now here's something that's important to say about a builder. A builder doesn't write plans. You know, when you hire, like, a quick contractor to, like, I need you to to put in the new backsplash in my kitchen. He doesn't, like, go out and write detailed architectural drawings and all that kind of stuff. He goes to Lowe's. He gets the tile you want, and he starts with his hammer and he breaks it apart. And you have to be really careful in this phase not to become a future phase like an architect, which we'll talk about in a minute. Your job right now isn't to create like super detailed meaningful financial plans and projections, because the business just isn't in a place that you can do any of it based on data. And if you don't do it on data, it's just based on your guess. And you do not wanna get it in a position of having to be judged against your guesses. Mhmm. I wanna be judged against my informed decisions, not my opinions. And so the builder that tries to create the blueprint is always gonna end up having that blueprint suffocate them versus just be building. Just sell the get the money in. That's your only job to 10,000,000, not to create like, a spreadsheet that's a mile long with all these comp things and the your org chart build out and all your segmentation. I tell most companies, like, you shouldn't even be thinking about segmentation till between 10 and $25,000,000. Just run the deals and hire good enough reps that can run the deals. Completely agree. And I made the mistake of trying to figure out every single conversion metric by stage when I had six reps. And I'm like, just look at them. Yeah. It doesn't need to be overcomplicated. Let's talk about the next phase. Going from builder, one to ten million ARR, which is really a manager role, to doctor, which is 10 to $25,000,000 in ARR Yeah. Which is what you consider like a director role. So now managing managers. Yes. What are the key roles or distinctions between a doctor versus a builder? I think if you've really run the builder part right, like, you're running fast and messy. And you're not trying to necessarily, like you said earlier, like, diagnose the stage by stage conversion rates. You just know you don't have enough deals. So are we missing our number because we don't have enough deals or because we're not winning enough deals. Right? All the answers should be able to be done with simple mathematical formulas. If you have to get into algebra, calculus, extremely complicated sales formulas, you're on the wrong trap. The doctor though, that's exactly what they're supposed to do. You've now put in place in this fast and messy way The here's the foundation. This is how we do it. We actually have steam. We have, like, the market is responding to how we're doing things. Now it's time to start to fine tune. It's like the difference between dropping in a new engine or, like, looking at for exactly what spark plug isn't sparking. Right? The builder drops in the engine and just runs the car. It might not run great, but, like, it's running. The doctor's job is to get in there and fine tune that thing so it's humming. Right? So the doctor, you switch to a much more metric analytical numbers based role so that you can start to build the corpus of data that you need to start to make really strong data driven decisions. And you start to build a culture of we make decisions around what we see in the data versus the builder is, listen. Let's huddle up real quick. What are we doing? Boom. Let's do that. That sounds great. Right? Which is more consensus driven. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. So I remember this happened to me. I paid right around $10,000,000 in ARR. And I don't know if it was that mental milestone of 10,000,000 ARR where I was like, okay. These metrics are starting to matter a lot more. I can't touch every deal. I'm managing managers. And the day in the life of a sales leader changes a lot Mhmm. At this point in time. Can you talk about what does the day in the life look like for a doctor versus a builder? Yeah. A builder, I would say that you're still a lot of, of what's on your calendar is sales calls. You're still gonna have a lot of one on ones, obviously, since you're probably still directly managing people. So it's filled up with that kind of tactical stuff that a regular sales manager would do. The doctor is now that manager of managers. They're now the director. So the job changes. And we've talked about, like, manager to rep is a huge transition. People manager to manager of managers is another huge transition. Right? So some differences in your day is you're not gonna be on as many sales calls because if you're on a bunch of sales calls, what are your sales managers doing? And if you, your sales manager, and your rep are on a sales call, you're weird. Alright? So Triple stack. We have $10,000 deal. Team selling. Yeah. Team sales team. Yeah. 10 reps. So, the you you start to move out of sales calls. You start to move out of one on ones. Your one on ones go from weekly to maybe monthly with reps. Right? You're setting a lot more time with your cross departmental partners. So demand gen, do you understand their numbers and how they impact you? Rev ops, do they are they showing you what's happening inside your process? In customer success, are they showing you what's happening with the deals after them? You have to start to zoom out and take a bigger look at what's happening to diagnose stuff. Because you know, if we go to the doctor and you say you have a headache and they talk to you for five seconds and they're like, well, listen, we need to get you an MRI right now. You're freaked the fuck out. Right? But if you're like, wait a second. You haven't drink any water for the last three days? You're dehydrated. Go drink some liquid IV and you'll be fine. Then everything's not that big of a deal. And that's where the doctor phase it becomes very important. You can make a headache and MRI situation or you can make it just drink some more water situation. And the doctor's job is to minimize the blast radius on what the answer is. Like, it's okay if it's MRI, but make sure it's MRI with the data. It's okay to give somebody liquid IV, but don't give somebody liquid IV that needs an MRI. I think the role of a doctor that is oftentimes most understated is you are preventing thrash Yeah. On the organization. And so if you see a blip in the numbers or if you see the sales numbers go down, oftentimes, what will happen in this phase is every other department will start trying to get the sales team to do all different types of things. Next thing you you know, your managers are running 17 new types of trainings with all their reps and all that jazz. And so I think it's a really important point that you make, which is if the answer is to just drink some water Yeah. Make sure that the entire org is not overreacting because your job is to make sure that people understand how the sales organization is run. And John Sherr, on an episode earlier, gave a really good example of there are different metrics that you should be using to run your sales organization internally versus the metrics that you show externally to someone who doesn't understand the beast of sales. Yeah. And I think that's something that really gets mastered in the doctor phase. And I would say, two important lessons in the doctor phase are l one and l two metrics. L one metrics are lagging metrics that are like, alright. How many how much revenue are we generating? How many meetings are we creating? Right? Leading metrics are the things that you use to diagnose a problem happening to a lagging metric. So if you're not booking meetings, you need to look at, are you dialing enough? Are you sending enough emails? Are you targeting the right people? Are your people using the right messages? And so it's really important in the doctor phase to clearly define your l one, your lagging metrics. And then how do you diagnose the problem is by defining the l two metrics that your managers and your builders because you're now a doctor so you have to hire builders that your builders can use to diagnose their own problems by themselves. So that's one concept l one versus l two. And then the other concept that you need to understand is a volume metric versus a conversion metric. So you need to line up your funnel so that you understand your volume metrics, which typically are your l one lagging. Right? How many calls did we do? Right? That's a volume. It's just a number. And then there's the conversion. Right? How many calls do we convert into book meeting set? Right? A volume number is the result of the behavior that creates conversion. So you can never actually change if you book more meetings, but what you can do is you can change how well you convert phone calls into meetings. Right? And so that's an important distinction to make sure that you have in your coaching to conversion, which is behavior versus volume, which is the result of the behavior. Boom. Alright. So we have doctor phase, 10 to 25,000,000. Let's move on to architect phase. 25 to 100,000,000, and that is what you consider to be a true VP of sales. That's right. The architect is now when you're completely cross departmental. Like, your job is inseparable from your VP of marketing, your VP of success, maybe your CRO, maybe your VP of finance. You now have to take into account what is the blueprint that I'm gonna create? What are the diagram drawings that I'm gonna create so that somebody knows how to do this little detail of the sales process or this little deck needs to look this way. Right? That architect's job is to see how all those pieces are coming together and where are the areas that, like, you're a little worried about. So segmentation starts to come into play. Maybe we wanna create segmentation on geography or on, size of deal or, you know, number of employees or something like that. Right? You start to think about segmentation. This is where you start to really start to think about your comp plan. How's my comp plan tie into the behaviors that I need to get from my doctors and my builders. Right? Because again, now you're a architect. You gotta hire doctors. Right? And, so this is the real key to me of, like, this is a switch from leader to executive. So we went from doer, which is an IC basically to a manager of people, from a manager of people to a manager of manager. And now what we're trying to do is that next lead to I'm an executive. Like, I'm leading leaders. Right? And that jump to executive is not quite as foreign as the other previous two, but it's still a little bit difficult. But this is in order to be an executive, you have to be part of an executive team. No executive is on alone on the island. And it the architect's job is to make sure that no builder or no subcontractor doesn't understand what the whole plans are. And that's mostly what your job is is to do your piece of the company's blueprint around the GTM side. It sounds like a lot of these projects are not necessarily longer term, but they're much more bigger sweeping initiatives. So you might have to go through an entire month long or quarter long analysis on we gotta redraw our entire segmentation lines. Yep. Right? Or we need to rethink our pricing and packaging, and that's where I need to work with my marketing team or things of that sort. I'm curious. What is your level of involvement with things like forecasting, digging in on deals when you're literally running an organization that's doing 25 to a 100,000,000. Yeah. I say that at Outreach and in a catalyst, the higher that you get up, the less control that you actually have over everything, which it seems very different. Because everybody's like, well, I'm a CRO. Like, I'm the boss. Actually, see being a CRO is an exercise of I have no control. I just need to make sure that I've given good directions. I have a good plan. Like, I'm a good architect. And I've now said, here you go. Right? Like, can we follow the plan or not? Right? So I think that that's a a big piece of it. If that's your main job, then that means that you have to give up other things. And partly what you do give up is being on sales calls. Like, a VP should only be on the most important sales calls, not that many. A VP should be going through with each of his directors or sales managers, their top 10 deals, not every deal. Right? And if you've been a great architect at to this point. Right? And a good doctor, you've created these processes along the way that make sure that the frontline manager that maybe you only meet with once a quarter now is actually running the processes that you have in place. Right? Like, again, the architect's job is isn't to just create the plans, is to make sure people are following the plans. And so that might mean that you are just making sure people are following your forecast methodology that you created when you were more of a doctor or a builder. So let's say that you're brought in as an architect, and you're pretty foreign to the sales motion. Like, there's no way you're gonna learn all the nuances of how reps run discovery calls, your five stage sales process, the forecasting methodology, and all that stuff. One thing that I've seen with a lot of these more senior leaders is they actually can lose touch with what's going on at the growing level. So I know, fortunately, you were at Outreach all the way from $0 in ARR through the $100,000,000 mark. But if someone's coming into a sales organization, how can they effectively enact change on the organization and enact influence on how people are selling when they're fundamentally really far removed from the action? So I would tell you, I don't think they can. I think that you have to like, if you can't run your own deal as a sales leader and don't have enough expertise, then you have no real business figuring out what's wrong with it or how to change it. But you can't do that right away because it takes time to orient yourself and figure those things out. I would say that if you can't do those things right away or so foreign that you have to work your way to them, the most important thing is just building those relationships. Like, the relationships will help you create change, help you figure things out. But if you don't build the relationship, then you'll never get to the understanding. If you don't get to the understanding, you actually won't change anything. Alrighty, Mark. And then give me the one sentence riff on communicator phase. Yeah. The the communicator's job is now to mostly work outside, of what's going on with the the company and meaning that, like, my job is to clearly communicate what my expectations are, clearly communicate the timeline by which I need those expectations we met, and then evaluate the mental model by which people used to fix them. That was the biggest revelation that my executive coach gave me because I lost my way around a $150,000,000, and I didn't feel like I was adding value to outreach anymore. And my coach helped me to find it. Like, Mark, your job now is more about communication than anything. Clearly communicate expectations when the dime by which those expectations need to be met. And last thing is is what is the mental model used to create those solutions? Folks, thirty minutes to a 150,000,000 plus an hour. We started with the doer phase zero to one. Builder, one to 10. Doctor, 10 to 25. Architect, 25 to a 100. And communicator, a $100,000,000 plus. Folks, Mark wrote down all of this stuff in one of the keynotes a while ago. And so he has an entire deck where he walks through all of these phases and what it entails in each of those. And so if you enjoyed this session, there is a link to that down in the show notes, and we will do tons of more content if you give us some feedback. So if you like this one, go connect with Mark on LinkedIn and tell him what you thought. And honestly, ping him and tell him what you want us to cover next on The Leadership Show because we love doing these live sessions. Alrighty, folks. We'll catch you on the next one. Thanks.
