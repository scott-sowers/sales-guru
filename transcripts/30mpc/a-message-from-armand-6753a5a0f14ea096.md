## Transcript

What's going on, folks? It is Arman from thirty minutes to Presidents Club, and I have a really exciting update that will be changing the way your podcast feed looks over the next couple of weeks. So you might be familiar with the fact that on Tuesdays, Nick and I usually interview a sales guest focused on, like, tactics that reps can use. And then on Thursdays, we interview a leader focused on ways that you can run a sales team. And those interviews are great, but some of you who've been following us for a long time might have known that we, one, do a playbook episode every 10 episodes where we break down one topic deep beginning to end with no guests involved for about thirty minutes. And then two, we used to do YouTube content two years ago, but, honestly, like, we didn't have the team in place to be able to, like, support the pace that YouTube required. And so we ended up not doing that anymore even though a lot of people really like the content. So we're bringing that back. So on Tuesdays, what you can expect moving forward is every other Tuesday will be a different topic of interview. So, for example, in the first week, Nick and I might interview a sales guest, and then the next week, Mark and I might interview a leadership guest. So it'll go sales, leadership, sales, leadership, but those interviews will always be on Tuesday. And then Thursdays will be reserved for step by step tactical breakdowns, YouTube style videos. So I think you're gonna get three things out of this. Number one is when we have the chance to preplan an episode, you end up getting more tactics per minute. So, like, sometimes guest interviews, they can sprawl all over the place, and we do a good job of, like, trying to, like, steer them in the right direction. But, like, a guest might talk about, like, cold calling and then discovery and then, like, post discovery recap. But if you just wanna learn how to, like, do a cold call beginning to end, we need to, like, preplan that episode. And so YouTube allows you to, like, preplan the topic where can we can be like, okay. Here's an episode on how to open a cold call. Here's an episode on how to run a negotiation. Here's an episode on what to do if someone says I'm not interested. These can be, like, ten to twenty minute bite sized, click a video, learn something new, get out of there, practice it in the field kind of thing. So that's number one, is you'll get more tactics per minute. Number two is by pre planning some of these episodes, you'll get more step by step breakdowns, which tends to be better content. And lastly, number three, there are some fun formats that we've wanted to do on the show for the longest time that just, like, don't lend themselves to the interview format. So, for example, we've wanted to, like, break down real cold calls on the show, and we never got the chance to do that. We wanted to, like, pull out a whiteboard and, like, diagram some things or, like, tear down an email or, like, whiteboard out, discovery process step by step. And you can't really do that on a guest interview, but you can do that in, like, a pre planned YouTube format. So all of those episodes will be dropping on this feed on Thursdays, but the best way to consume that stuff is it would mean a ton to us if you took two seconds and subscribe to our YouTube channel. I'll put the link in the show notes, but it's just, youtube.combackslash30mpc. We'll put it in the show notes or you can just, like, look up thirty minutes to Presidents Club YouTube and it will pop up first. In August, we are going to start this new drop cadence, so you should be, like, seeing this stuff come relatively soon. And the last thing is I always really, really appreciate it when people give us direct feedback on some of the changes that we're making or the content that we're putting out. So folks, if you could email me at armond@30mpc when this content starts to drop or before it drops, I would love to hear what you would like us to break down in some of these YouTube videos. Nick and I have covered everything from cold calling to cold email to discovery. We also wanna bring on some other guests to do some YouTube episodes. Like, we'd love to do something with Ian Konjac where he breaks down how he closed his $10,000,000 deal with Berkshire Hathaway. But, honestly, like, you all are the best dictators of, like, what content you wanna see or what you're trying to learn in sales. So just email me at armond@30mpc.com. This is probably insane, but that is my real email, and I look at every single email that I get. So I would love to hear, one, what you think about some of the content that's coming out. Or two, I'd love to hear just, like, what you want us to put on the YouTube channel. And I think that's it, folks. Sub to us on YouTube, and, hopefully, we can give you even more value dense content every single week. Alrighty, folks. Catch you soon. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes.
