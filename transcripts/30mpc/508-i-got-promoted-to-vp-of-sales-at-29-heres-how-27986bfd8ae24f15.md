## Transcript

I'm not talking be, like, 10% better than everyone else. If you wanna jump people in your career, you have to be so far ahead of them that it would literally be insulting to not promote you. I became a VP of sales at age 29, and guess what? I didn't even start my career in sales. And so I was already behind, but I learned how to get promoted way faster than most people do in sales. And today, my goal is to break that down for you. If we haven't met before, my name is Armand Feraud, and here's what my sales trajectory looked like. At age 20, I got my first sales internship selling insurance where I became a top 2% sales rep in the country. But then I realized I hated insurance sales, and so I actually left. I worked in finance for three years from ages 21 to 24, and then my best friend and cofounder, Nick, got into sales and was making more money than me. And so I decided that would be a good idea. I got back into sales. I became a mid market AE at a company called Carta, and I was there from ages 24 to 27. And in those three years, I climbed from mid market AE to director of sales. I was a mid market AE for one year, then I became a senior manager of sales development where I was running the whole sales development org, managing managers for a year. And then I did so well there that I ultimately became a director of sales running all of SMB sales and sales development, an org of about 40 or 50 at the age of 27. At which point, I was poached to join a company called Pave where I was their ninth employee and there was one other sales rep, and I hired out a team of 40 between sales and marketing over two years, which eventually led me to become their VP of sales before I left to go full time on this business. So there are four steps that I will walk through that will make this path seem semi repeatable. They are, one, be so good that you cannot be ignored. Two, be better than the next reps at the next job. Three, run your promotion sales cycle. And then four, pick the right company, which might be the most important one. I'm gonna give a huge disclaimer on the front end of this. If you are the rep who's doing, like, 89% of your quota, or you're, like, number three on the team, or, like, in a really good month, you're number two, but then some months, you're number four or five, like, this advice is a force multiplier for your performance. If you're getting average performance, this might give you slightly above average career trajectory. You might be able to, like, get promoted two months faster or something like that. But the reality is, like, if you wanna, like, jump quick or even, like, skip levels or, like, get promoted in nine months or six months, you've gotta be so stupidly better than everyone else. And I think there are way too many people who, like, spend too much time on, like, the mechanics of, this company won't promote me instead of thinking, like, how can I be so good that it would literally be, like, an insult to promote someone over me? So I'll give that disclaimer, old man angry up front. Let's go into step number one, which is be so good you can't be ignored. There are three ways that I think about this. Number one is you work harder than everyone else. Number two is you learn faster than anyone else. And then number three is you figure out how to become a sales floor legend. So when I was at Carta, when I joined as a mid market AE, they were in the middle of a transition from inbound to outbound. K? And so all of the sales reps on the floor hated cold calling. And I was part of the new reps that were brought on to, like, double the team size. So, like, inbound was drying up, but, like, no one was changing the behavior. They were also nice, fat, and happy, and working nine to five, and refused to go and pick up the phone. And so I worked eight to seven every single day for the first nine months that I was at Carta, and I showed up. And at 08:30 or nine, I would start picking up the phone. And before the VP of sales even got situated at his desk, I was the guy who's dialing down folks. I was booking three, four, five meetings alone on the phone, usually eight outbound meetings total per week as a rep. That was more than most reps were booking in a month. I was frankly just willing to work 10 times harder than anyone else at the thing that no one wanted to do. From there outside of my job Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. I would literally be, like, practicing my opener on the way to work. I would be listening to podcasts on the way to work. I would listen to podcasts like this one on the way home. And, like, sales is one of these weird careers folks where, like, the skills literally pay the bills. Like, if you acquire a new skill in sales, like a cold call opener, you can use that to book another meeting that you wouldn't have booked tomorrow. And that meeting will make you money because you listen to a podcast for thirty minutes. Like, it's amazing. Like, if you learn a negotiation trick, you could use it in a negotiation tomorrow and, like, save $5,000 on your next deal. And it was amazing, like, how many people would complain about, like, my manager isn't developing me or the enablement trainings are good. I'm like, I actually would rather have it be that way. You know why? Because I want everyone else to get, like, the really bad training if I'm competing on a sales floor, and, like, I'm gonna go find the good training. If everyone's getting, like, really, really, really good training at the job, I'm, like, shoot, like, how am I gonna get better training elsewhere? This is actually, like, an opportunity to differentiate yourself if your company doesn't train you well. Sometimes, like, it pays to be a shark in a swimming pool when all the other people in the swimming pool are kinda lazy. So that's number two, which is learn. And then number three is a lot of people really, really, really underestimate the power of having a superpower on a sales floor. And the reality is not every salesperson is good at everything, and that is myself included, especially early on in my career. I honestly kinda sucked at discovery. I went from insurance straight to mid market AE, which is another story. I never really ran a consultative deal cycle. I had to learn that stuff later on, like multithreading, no idea how it worked or anything like that. But when the new VP of sales came in and they saw my numbers, I had literally done 300% of my ramp quota in my first quarter. And then the next two quarters, I was the number one rep way earlier than anyone else had become before. He was like, the reason that that person is successful is because, like, Arma knows how to prospect. The director of SDR quit, and he was like, I only know one person at this company that can prospect that well, and it's that guy. And that's how I actually got promoted to senior manager of sales development where I was managing the existing SDR managers. The current SDR managers were not ready to go to that next step, but I had proven that I had a certain, like, name and notoriety across the sales floor that got me known as the prospecting guy. I'm not talking be, like, 10% better than everyone else. If you wanna jump people in your career, you have to be so far ahead of them that it would literally be insulting to not promote you. The second step is you can't just be good at your current job. You have to be better than the next reps at the next job. So if you're going from SDR to SMB or if you're going from SMB AE to mid market AE, you need to be better than the midline of the reps who are in that next level. In other words, my litmus test was if I add this person to this team in six months, does quota attainment go up or down? If it goes down, then I do not want this person on my team. I don't care how good of an SDR you are. If you can only prospect, but you can't do anything related to closing whatsoever, like, you can't be unapologetically bad at the stuff that is required to do the new job. And so what I always tell people is in your first six months, focus on nothing, but like destroying the current job, and like don't even come close to asking for a promotion. And then from there, from month six to nine, that's when you can start planning for the next job. The way you do this is you usually wanna go to senior reps who are on that team, like get the good reps on the next team up, and get them running mock discoveries with you. Get them riding along for deals with you because I'll cover this in step three. Those are the people who are gonna be pushing on the sales manager. So if I have, like, the number one mid market rep is mentoring me, the number one mid market rep has a lot of leverage with the sales manager of mid market. And if I'm trying to get onto that team, that sales manager is gonna go to the number one rep and be like, hey. Do do you think Arman's ready? Do you think Jamie's ready? And if I've done my job right over the last three months, they're like, that kid has gone through my meat grinder, and they're gonna, like, be like, no. No. That's my guy. Like, you you gotta promote that. Like, they're gonna take responsibility for your career pathing, and, like, that's what you want. It's like, don't get me wrong, like, you need to do your own pushing, but the best promotion cycles are when, like, everyone else is doing that pushing for you. And it's, like, you can just, like, focus on, like, look at me, I'm doing such a great job, and they can be the ones who are, like, yo, you gotta get this guy in the seat. And then step number three is you need to run your promotion sales cycle. So to be clear, this is when it gets a little bit into, like, managing the internal politics. You only get the right to manage the internal politics if you're better than everyone else at your current job, and you're better than the midline at the next job. But if those two things are true, remember, month zero to six, are you just focused on, like, doing the job? At month six, that's when I like to call my shot with my manager. And what I mean by calling your shot is you kinda need to apply pressure upwards on management and let them know that you, like, know you're crushing it and you're grateful for the opportunity, but you are cognizant of your market value, and you wanna start thinking about what that next role is. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. And so I'll usually broach a conversation with my managers that sounds something like this. Like, hey. How do you feel like I've been doing over the last year? They'll say, you've been doing really, really good. Awesome. I wanted to do a little bit of a retro. I feel like I've been really, really good here. I think this is what it takes for me to get to the next level. I know I still have tons to learn, but I'm curious, like, in your eyes, like, you know what my career goals are. I want to be an SMB AE. I wanna be a mid market AE. And based on how I'm doing in this role, I'm curious. Could you help me build out a plan to close any gaps that I have to get to the next role? Notice you're not asking for a promotion. You're asking for advice. Ask for advice, and then they'll usually be like, I wanna help this kid. If you ask for a promotion, sometimes people out of spite will be like, they're getting too impatient. Like, hold on. Slow down. You're not aware of the fact that you're not actually ready for this job. So that's how you basically set up your plan. And if you've done this correct, the next three months, months six to nine, should look like this. You've come up with a list of things that you need to get good at. Maybe it's discovery. Maybe it's multithreading and mid market. Maybe it's advanced business cases or executive presence once you start to get to enterprise. And you've come up with a plan with your manager of these are the skills, and these are the tests that I would like you to help me run to get good at that. So for example, if I had a really good SDR, I'd be like, awesome. Now what we're gonna do is I want you to go watch these discovery tapes, and then every two weeks, you and I are gonna run a mock discovery together. And that's gonna be your test for you to show me how far you've come in discovery. And so the magic of this is you've basically, like, set the exit criteria for what it takes to get to the next job. You've set a plan to get there. And now for the next three months, you're just gonna call back to it. You're just gonna keep calling back to it. So every two weeks, three weeks in your one on one, you're gonna give them an update, and you're gonna own your own professional development plan. A lot of reps are like, why won't my team promote me? Why won't my team develop me? Well, guess what? How about you take your own career path into your own plans, and you pull what's needed from your manager, and you make their job easy. That's called managing up, folks. From there, you have month six to nine where you're, like, learning the next job, and then months nine to twelve are planning the transition. So at the end of nine months, usually, that's when you can start to pick up the heat, and you can be like, hey. So, like, am I in everything in this plan? And then, again, if you are good at your job, you're, like, pretty much better than most people in the midline of the next one. And the mid market AEs who are on the team that you wanna get on to, they're already telling your manager too, like, yeah. I think we all know, like, you know, this this gal over here, she would smoke the entire, like, bottom half of this team. And, honestly, like, I'd probably give them, like, six months before they're giving me a run for my money. You know? That's how you know how this is going well. And so now you actually have the opportunity to make your ask. And so, usually, I'll ask to do, like, our normal, like, quarterly performance review or, like, can we do our quarterly retro just because I know we've been working on these skills for the last three months? And I'll start and I'll be like, I have a self reflection, but I'm curious from your perspective. Like, how am I doing both in this role and then in terms of my readiness for the next one? And they'll usually if you've done a good job, they will usually say, like, you're doing pretty good. And at this point, I do like to make an explicit ask, where I'll say something like, look. I know that you've got internal precedent and all these other things going on when it comes to promotions, but, like, I think you know where my career goals are, and I've, like, worked really, really, really hard. And I hope you can see I'm, like, putting in the hours outside of the job to get ready for that. And I'm, like, shown into my numbers too. What would it look like for me to make that jump into the next role? Like, is there an interview process? Is there an internal promotion cycle going on? Do you have a sense of, like, when the next slot is opening up? Do we get on the same side of the table just because, like, I really, really, really care about this for, like, pushing my career goals forward. And, usually, you can try to get them on the same side of the table, and you'll get reality from your manager. So at this point, look. You're not gonna get an instant promotion on the spot. But here's why it is really important to make the ask. I have been part of these promotion boardrooms before, where every three, six months, they look at all the people on the team, and they're like, here's who should or shouldn't be promoted. And there are times where they'll look at a rep, and they'll be like, this rep is really, really good, but I think they're comfortable for now, or I don't think they're getting too antsy. And it sucks, folks, but if you are not the squeaky wheel sometimes, people will be like, I think that person can sit in the seat for, like, another six months, because you haven't done anything to show the world that you know your market value and that you know you're ready for the next role. In a dream world, ideally, everyone's like, great. I'm gonna do the right thing for mister and missus rep, and the moment they start performing well, I'm gonna promote them. But the reality is, like, that's not how life works. So figure out how to work the game. Alright? So you make your ask, and the next time they go into their promotion reviews, usually they'll be like, hey, like, this person's, like, starting to make some noise about, like, getting moving. And I've talked to other people on the team. They're putting in all the work. They're not being annoying about it. They haven't asked me a million times. But, like, we should probably, like, start to put some sort of process in place. So, folks, here's a secret. At step three, you have everything you need to be at the front of the promotion line. Problem is that doesn't guarantee that you actually get into the club. That only gets you to the front of the line. But if the club is at full capacity, they're not gonna let anyone in. So step four is you have to actually pick the right company. There are two things that need to happen for you to get promoted quickly. Number one, there needs to be a slot. And in order for there to be a slot, the only way that there is a slot is either the company is growing so that people are, like, actually moving up and more roles are being opened up, or people are being let go because they're not performing. But the reality is if people aren't performing, oftentimes, they won't reopen a slot when they let someone go because they're like, jeez. Like, maybe we actually need to, like, decrease the number of reps in the segment. So there's a completely separate video that we did on, like, picking a good company. But the TLDR is you need to find a company that is growing. That is usually why I recommend people join companies in the growth stages. So usually between, like, series b and, like, just pre IPO because number one, those companies are growing pretty quickly. But then number two, the second criteria of a good company is they believe in acceleration. Usually, companies that are pre IPO or companies that, like, haven't gone public yet are willing to bend on traditional promotion timelines. And the reason for that is they're growing so quickly that they have to fill the seats. And so they'd rather fill those seats with internal talent and then, like, hire junior talent from the bottom up. But then they're just a little bit less rigid in their corporate structure. Like, if you go to Oracle or Salesforce, love those companies, but, like, they have, like, a pretty regimented timeline where it's, like, two years parole. But if you go to, like, a series c startup that's, like, gone from 200,000,000 in revenue to 50,000,000 in revenue in a single year, they're gonna be, like, I gotta bring the people up with this ship. Like, it's a rising ship that, like, everyone gets to benefit from. So, like, try to find those companies. So again, I'm not gonna go through, like, the entire criteria used. We did another video on that, like, right over here down in the show notes on, like, how to not pick a crappy company in sales. Like, go watch that video and hopefully it'll help you out, folks. So folks, that's a wrap. If this was helpful, my guess is you are trying to get ready for one of two roles. Either one, it's a closing role or a more sophisticated closing role, at which case you probably need to master discovery, Or number two, you're trying to become a sales leader, and that's actually the harder role to prepare for. So I've got two things for you. Both are discount codes. Number one is we have our entire discovery course. If you are an SDR trying to go into SMB, you will be, like, a billion light years ahead of everyone else. It will give you everything you need in one zero one on discovery, but frankly, it will also give you most of the two zero one stuff, if not some of the three zero one stuff, in terms of, like, advanced question tactics, how to find six figure problems instead of five figure problems. So whether you're an SDR going SMB or an SMB rep going to mid market or frankly a mid market rep trying to, like, get 6 and 7 figure problems in enterprise, that course is, like, the gold standard on all things discovery. And then number two, Mark is the single sales leader who's taught me more than anything else. Mark Cosclo led outreach from 0 to 250,000,000 in ARR as their first employee all the way up until VP of sales and beyond. Like, he broke down his entire sales management operating system from forecasting to deal reviews to hiring to everything else in what is probably the best sales leadership course I've ever seen. So there are discount codes to both of those courses down below. Go check them out, and we will see you on the next one.
