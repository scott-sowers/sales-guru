If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. We've saved, like, a good chunk of this sesh for some q and a. Tom asked, how do you not sound salesy when you do get someone on the phone? Right. So the thing you gotta realize is that 99% of the cold calls that your prospect gets come from pretty crummy telemarketers. They come from people who are just ripping dials through a list, and they're they're pitching extended car warranties or these, like, loan forgiveness packages to literally anybody who will pick up the phone. And when your prospect hears your voice, a stranger's voice, they're trying to place you. They're trying to figure out the context for what's going on. And if you say the same things and if you sound the same as those sort of crummy telemarketers, you're gonna get put in that camp and you're gonna get rejected. But you're not a crappy telemarketer. Like, you're making a probably well researched or or at minimum well targeted cold call. And so the recommendation that we have is, one, you say things and you sound different than those other people. So you don't use the most common openers like, did I catch you at a bad time or, hey. How's your day going? Because that's what every other telemarketer says. Instead, I use what's called a a tailored permission opener where I lead with context. I own that it's a cold call, and then I use those two things as a way to get permission to pitch. So it might sound something like this. Will, I just finished reading the press release about your new office opening in Tacoma. And I'm gonna be honest. This is a cold call, but it is a well researched one. And I'm wondering if I can get half a minute to share why that press release had prompted me to call you, and then you can totally hang up on me if it doesn't make sense to speak from there. Ovi said, any advice on getting those in the transport logistics company in The UK to work recruitment agency that specializes in that division? A lot of them say they have a recruiter already. What can I say up front to differentiate? So that's an objection. But, also, if you lead with, we're a recruiting service to help you with this, if your prospect has anything even remotely close to that category, they're gonna tell you they're all set. Instead, we need to go to the problem. And so if I'm a recruiter, I might say something like, look. The reason that I called you is we work with a bunch of different chief people officers in Tacoma, and one of the things that we hear from them is that it's really, really hard for them to staff experienced engineering talent. And I saw that you all have a new product that you're building right now, it looks like. I read some of the stuff on your website, and my guess is you're looking to bring some of those folks aboard who can help build the code for that. And, look, I'm calling you totally out of the blue, but we work with a number of folks who are looking to add experience engineering talent. And I'm wondering if you you might be open to talking more when I'm when I'm not totally cold calling you out of the blue. Here's another question from Chris Baule, who's also in the recruiting staff industry. A lot of people feel like all staffing companies are the same, and they all they've already got providers in place. So this sounds like an objection. Like, we've already got a solution. We've already got a provider. What do we do if someone says that after we've given our problem proposition? The key to all competitors and existing solutions is you have to find the one thing the one thing you do differently that other people suck at, and you need to ask them a question that gets them to think about that. So I'll give you an example. And, again, this is off the cuff, so let's see if I I can actually do this. You know, Bets Recruiting is not a sponsor. Bets Recruiting is a sales specific recruiting agency. Mhmm. K? Sales specific. They help you recruit salespeople. And so if I was calling Will and I knew Will was trying to hire salespeople, which would be in my ICP, then here's what it would sound like. He says, I'm working with insert random recruiting agency here that's not specialized in sales. I'm gonna say, oh, you work with insert random recruiting agency. Honestly, I I've talked to a lot of folks working with them, and it rarely makes sense to switch. Just so I make sure no one from my team calls you again, you're I imagine you're able to see their OTE, their attainment, and all their, like, past sales performance and all that stuff. Right? So notice what I did. I know Betts Recruiting has the OTE expectations, the past attainment, the sales performance, and I know most other recruiters don't have that because they're not specialized in sales. And so I'm gonna be like, you you don't you don't have a problem with this. Right? I'm almost assuming that he's got it taken care of, and he'll be like, no. But and now I can start to educate him a little bit, and I can be like, oh, honestly, Will, chances are you're probably still not gonna switch recruiters. But, like, one of the things that makes us a little bit different from other recruiters is we're specialized in sales. And I noticed you had three job postings, and you probably have a million applications. And it would be nice to be able to sort those all your applicants by what their actual attainment was. Are you open to taking a look at this thing if for no other reason you know it's out there? Mhmm. And so my goal is, number one, fry a hole poke a hole with a trap question. Get Will to think about the gap and the solution today. And then notice what I did. I sold the test drive at the end of it. It's called selling the test drive, not the car. You're probably gonna stick with your existing solution, but are you open to taking a look at this thing just so you know it's out there? Could I at least show you what it looks like to look at a repotainment report? There is one person here who has a question specifically for you, Armand. You said, hey. We work with a few other x. What if you don't have any customers or any really book things that you can mention there? Are you gonna lie? Are you gonna say you do when you don't? What's the deal? If you're using, like, the heard the name tossed around opener and you don't have any common thread between your customers and their customers, in the rare case that you literally have zero customers, which is probably not the case, rely on investors, design partners, etcetera, but that is usually not the case. So what I recommend doing is similar to how Nick said, have a stack rank of your top five things that you can look for about them and press release, etcetera. If you're using the Heard the Name tossed around, have a stack rank of your top five forms of commonality that you could cite. So, for example, I would always go for same investor first and then same coworkers and then same situation. You could even say we work with a bunch of other chief people officers that are in the tech space. The more specific you can get, the better. The real money move is almost everyone has a couple of at least generic ones. Like, we work with other people in New York, and we work with a couple other chief people officers. The way you can make that more specific is you can say, hey. We work with a bunch of other chief people officers in New York. And now by combining two or three forms of commonality, I get you to sit up. Right? And so I know Nick lives in Pasadena, and I can say, hey. I work with a bunch of folks in the sales space and and know a bunch of folks who are out in Pasadena too. It's Arman from thirty MPC. Have you heard her name tossed around? Just by getting that close to home, I get this sit up moment versus, hey. We work with a couple other people who breathe. That's what's not very exclusive. We work with a couple of other VPs. Yeah. VPs. So you've added one extra thing to make us slightly more relevant. I love that. We've got time for one more question. Someone said here, I'm in the higher ed space, and a lot of people are super busy right now. The most common objection they're hearing is, I'm sorry. I'm busy right now. How are you gonna handle that? We can even role play. Ring ring. I'm real busy right now. I'm real busy right now. But you had the time to say it twice, Will, so I I appreciate you taking that much time alone. I should have assumed. I know we got school starting and all that stuff, and and you're probably completely swamped. Just so no one from my team calls you again, is it that you guys are just totally swamped right now because it's busy season and school is about to start, or are you just like a crazy lean team and every single day, you're, like, closing the phone or closing the laptop at nine? I just don't have time to be taking calls like this. That's all. Yeah. Completely understand. And, Will, you can be completely honest with me. How much of it is the fact that you're completely swamped right now or my pitch just sort of sucked and you might not like getting cold calls? And it's okay if my pitch sucked. Look. There are a million different ed tech companies trying to call me, so I I I it it's a little bit of both, I'll be honest. I am busy, but I'm probably not interested in my BSLO. For sure. I mean, look. The the reason that I reached out to you specifically is because most folks who are running school programs, they can't stand it, and they're freaking swamped because they're trying to get all of their tutors to match up with all of their students on a daily basis, and you're coordinating all these tutors yourself. Like, those are actually the customers that tend to be the best fit for us. Are you open to me throwing a hold on the counter? Not now, but, like, in four weeks once school starts and all that stuff just so you can take a look and get a sense of what's out there. This is a hard one. This is, like, a 33% chance of me actually booking this meeting. So first thing is I broke the pattern hard. So Will said I'm busy twice. I'm cracking a joke. Second thing is he just kept trying to swap me away. Again, I need to find the objection. I split his objection. And so I said, look. Is it is it actually the timing thing, or is it my cold call just sucked and you have no interest? And he was still giving me, like, nothing. I'm probably, like, on thin ice at this point. So all I'm gonna do, because he's really not giving me anything, is I've gotta shoot my best trap question across. And that's what I did. Is I'm like, look. The reason that I reached out to you is because I'm assuming you have this type of problem. You're probably not gonna buy this. I'm gonna remove the pressure of the sale. In four weeks, would you take a look at this thing? Not for now, but for down the road. So that's, like, all you can do. And, again, like, I don't even have a tutoring software or anything like that. I'm just totally, like, off the cuff, but it's it's a game of playing the odds at that point. I like your point. There is no silver bullet here. All All we can do is do approaches that are gonna make it more likely like you did there. You agreed to me. You made a joke. You tried to diffuse. You took another shot at the problem proposition, maybe tweak that problem prop a little bit, and hopefully get them hooked on that. But that's not always gonna work.

If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out.\n\nIt's free in the show notes.\n\nSpeaker 2: We've saved, like, a good chunk of this sesh for some q and a. Tom asked, how do you not sound salesy when you do get someone on the phone?\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. So the thing you gotta realize is that 99% of the cold calls that your prospect gets come from pretty crummy telemarketers. They come from people who are just ripping dials through a list, and they're they're pitching extended car warranties or these, like, loan forgiveness packages to literally anybody who will pick up the phone. And when your prospect hears your voice, a stranger's voice, they're trying to place you. They're trying to figure out the context for what's going on.\n\nAnd if you say the same things and if you sound the same as those sort of crummy telemarketers, you're gonna get put in that camp and you're gonna get rejected. But you're not a crappy telemarketer. Like, you're making a probably well researched or or at minimum well targeted cold call. And so the recommendation that we have is, one, you say things and you sound different than those other people. So you don't use the most common openers like, did I catch you at a bad time or, hey.\n\nHow's your day going? Because that's what every other telemarketer says. Instead, I use what's called a a tailored permission opener where I lead with context. I own that it's a cold call, and then I use those two things as a way to get permission to pitch. So it might sound something like this.\n\nWill, I just finished reading the press release about your new office opening in Tacoma. And I'm gonna be honest. This is a cold call, but it is a well researched one. And I'm wondering if I can get half a minute to share why that press release had prompted me to call you, and then you can totally hang up on me if it doesn't make sense to speak from there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ovi said, any advice on getting those in the transport logistics company in The UK to work recruitment agency that specializes in that division? A lot of them say they have a recruiter already. What can I say up front to differentiate?\n\nSpeaker 0: So that's an objection. But, also, if you lead with, we're a recruiting service to help you with this, if your prospect has anything even remotely close to that category, they're gonna tell you they're all set. Instead, we need to go to the problem. And so if I'm a recruiter, I might say something like, look. The reason that I called you is we work with a bunch of different chief people officers in Tacoma, and one of the things that we hear from them is that it's really, really hard for them to staff experienced engineering talent.\n\nAnd I saw that you all have a new product that you're building right now, it looks like. I read some of the stuff on your website, and my guess is you're looking to bring some of those folks aboard who can help build the code for that. And, look, I'm calling you totally out of the blue, but we work with a number of folks who are looking to add experience engineering talent. And I'm wondering if you you might be open to talking more when I'm when I'm not totally cold calling you out of the blue.\n\nSpeaker 2: Here's another question from Chris Baule, who's also in the recruiting staff industry. A lot of people feel like all staffing companies are the same, and they all they've already got providers in place. So this sounds like an objection. Like, we've already got a solution. We've already got a provider.\n\nWhat do we do if someone says that after we've given our problem proposition?\n\nSpeaker 1: The key to all competitors and existing solutions is you have to find the one thing the one thing you do differently that other people suck at, and you need to ask them a question that gets them to think about that. So I'll give you an example. And, again, this is off the cuff, so let's see if I I can actually do this. You know, Bets Recruiting is not a sponsor. Bets Recruiting is a sales specific recruiting agency.\n\nSpeaker 2: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: K? Sales specific. They help you recruit salespeople. And so if I was calling Will and I knew Will was trying to hire salespeople, which would be in my ICP, then here's what it would sound like. He says, I'm working with insert random recruiting agency here that's not specialized in sales.\n\nI'm gonna say, oh, you work with insert random recruiting agency. Honestly, I I've talked to a lot of folks working with them, and it rarely makes sense to switch. Just so I make sure no one from my team calls you again, you're I imagine you're able to see their OTE, their attainment, and all their, like, past sales performance and all that stuff. Right? So notice what I did.\n\nI know Betts Recruiting has the OTE expectations, the past attainment, the sales performance, and I know most other recruiters don't have that because they're not specialized in sales. And so I'm gonna be like, you you don't you don't have a problem with this. Right? I'm almost assuming that he's got it taken care of, and he'll be like, no. But and now I can start to educate him a little bit, and I can be like, oh, honestly, Will, chances are you're probably still not gonna switch recruiters.\n\nBut, like, one of\n\nSpeaker 2: the things that makes us a\n\nSpeaker 1: little bit different from other recruiters is we're specialized in sales. And I noticed you had three job postings, and you probably have a million applications. And it would be nice to be able to sort those all your applicants by what their actual attainment was. Are you open to taking a look at this thing if for no other reason you know it's out there? Mhmm.\n\nAnd so my goal is, number one, fry a hole poke a hole with a trap question. Get Will to think about the gap and the solution today. And then notice what I did. I sold the test drive at the end of it. It's called selling the test drive, not the car.\n\nYou're probably gonna stick with your existing solution, but are you open to taking a look at this thing just so you know it's out there? Could I at least show you what it looks like to look at a repotainment report?\n\nSpeaker 2: There is one person here who has a question specifically for you, Armand. You said, hey. We work with a few other x. What if you don't have any customers or any really book things that you can mention there? Are you gonna lie?\n\nAre you gonna say you do when you don't? What's the deal?\n\nSpeaker 1: If you're using, like, the heard the name tossed around opener and you don't have any common thread between your customers and their customers, in the rare case that you literally have zero customers, which is probably not the case, rely on investors, design partners, etcetera, but that is usually not the case. So what I recommend doing is similar to how Nick said, have a stack rank of your top five things that you can look for about them and press release, etcetera. If you're using the Heard the Name tossed around, have a stack rank of your top five forms of commonality that you could cite. So, for example, I would always go for same investor first and then same coworkers and then same situation. You could even say we work with a bunch of other chief people officers that are in the tech space.\n\nThe more specific you can get, the better. The real money move is almost everyone has a couple of at least generic ones. Like, we work with other people in New York, and we work with a couple other chief people officers. The way you can make that more specific is you can say, hey. We work with a bunch of other chief people officers in New York.\n\nAnd now by combining two or three forms of commonality, I get you to sit up. Right? And so I know Nick lives in Pasadena, and I can say, hey. I work with a bunch of folks in the sales space and and know a bunch of folks who are out in Pasadena too. It's Arman from thirty MPC.\n\nHave you heard her name tossed around? Just by getting that close to home, I get this sit up moment versus, hey. We work with a couple other people who breathe. That's what's not very exclusive.\n\nSpeaker 2: We work with a couple of other VPs. Yeah. VPs.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you've\n\nSpeaker 2: added one extra thing to make us slightly more relevant. I love that. We've got time for one more question. Someone said here, I'm in the higher ed space, and a lot of people are super busy right now. The most common objection they're hearing is, I'm sorry.\n\nI'm busy right now. How are you gonna handle that? We can even role play. Ring ring. I'm real busy right now.\n\nI'm real busy right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you had the time to say it twice, Will, so I I appreciate you taking that much time alone. I should have assumed. I know we got school starting and all that stuff, and and you're probably completely swamped. Just so no one from my team calls you again, is it that you guys are just totally swamped right now because it's busy season and school is about to start, or are you just like a crazy lean team and every single day, you're, like, closing the phone or closing the laptop at nine?\n\nSpeaker 2: I just don't have time to be taking calls like this. That's all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Completely understand. And, Will, you can be completely honest with me. How much of it is the fact that you're completely swamped right now or my pitch just sort of sucked and you might not like getting cold calls? And it's okay if my pitch sucked.\n\nSpeaker 2: Look. There are a million different ed tech companies trying to call me, so I I I it it's a little bit of both, I'll be honest. I am busy, but I'm probably not interested in my BSLO.\n\nSpeaker 1: For sure. I mean, look. The the reason that I reached out to you specifically is because most folks who are running school programs, they can't stand it, and they're freaking swamped because they're trying to get all of their tutors to match up with all of their students on a daily basis, and you're coordinating all these tutors yourself. Like, those are actually the customers that tend to be the best fit for us. Are you open to me throwing a hold on the counter?\n\nNot now, but, like, in four weeks once school starts and all that stuff just so you can take a look and get a sense of what's out there. This is a hard one. This is, like, a 33% chance of me actually booking this meeting. So first thing is I broke the pattern hard. So Will said I'm busy twice.\n\nI'm cracking a joke. Second thing is he just kept trying to swap me away. Again, I need to find the objection. I split his objection. And so I said, look.\n\nIs it is it actually the timing thing, or is it my cold call just sucked and you have no interest? And he was still giving me, like, nothing. I'm probably, like, on thin ice at this point. So all I'm gonna do, because he's really not giving me anything, is I've gotta shoot my best trap question across. And that's what I did.\n\nIs I'm like, look. The reason that I reached out to you is because I'm assuming you have this type of problem. You're probably not gonna buy this. I'm gonna remove the pressure of the sale. In four weeks, would you take a look at this thing?\n\nNot for now, but for down the road. So that's, like, all you can do. And, again, like, I don't even have a tutoring software or anything like that. I'm just totally, like, off the cuff, but it's it's a game of playing the odds at that point.\n\nSpeaker 2: I like your point. There is no silver bullet here. All All we can do is do approaches that are gonna make it more likely like you did there. You agreed to me. You made a joke.\n\nYou tried to diffuse. You took another shot at the problem proposition, maybe tweak that problem prop a little bit, and hopefully get them hooked on that. But that's not always gonna work. That if it did, Amon would be a billionaire instead of a millionaire. Alright, folks.\n\nThanks Nick, Amon, for joining today. This has been absolutely awesome.

  "transcriptText": "Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. We've saved, like, a good chunk of this sesh for some q and a. Tom asked, how do you not sound salesy when you do get someone on the phone? Right. So the thing you gotta realize is that 99% of the cold calls that your prospect gets come from pretty crummy telemarketers. They come from people who are just ripping dials through a list, and they're they're pitching extended car warranties or these, like, loan forgiveness packages to literally anybody who will pick up the phone. And when your prospect hears your voice, a stranger's voice, they're trying to place you. They're trying to figure out the context for what's going on. And if you say the same things and if you sound the same as those sort of crummy telemarketers, you're gonna get put in that camp and you're gonna get rejected. But you're not a crappy telemarketer. Like, you're making a probably well researched or or at minimum well targeted cold call. And so the recommendation that we have is, one, you say things and you sound different than those other people. So you don't use the most common openers like, did I catch you at a bad time or, hey. How's your day going? Because that's what every other telemarketer says. Instead, I use what's called a a tailored permission opener where I lead with context. I own that it's a cold call, and then I use those two things as a way to get permission to pitch. So it might sound something like this. Will, I just finished reading the press release about your new office opening in Tacoma. And I'm gonna be honest. This is a cold call, but it is a well researched one. And I'm wondering if I can get half a minute to share why that press release had prompted me to call you, and then you can totally hang up on me if it doesn't make sense to speak from there. Ovi said, any advice on getting those in the transport logistics company in The UK to work recruitment agency that specializes in that division? A lot of them say they have a recruiter already. What can I say up front to differentiate? So that's an objection. But, also, if you lead with, we're a recruiting service to help you with this, if your prospect has anything even remotely close to that category, they're gonna tell you they're all set. Instead, we need to go to the problem. And so if I'm a recruiter, I might say something like, look. The reason that I called you is we work with a bunch of different chief people officers in Tacoma, and one of the things that we hear from them is that it's really, really hard for them to staff experienced engineering talent. And I saw that you all have a new product that you're building right now, it looks like. I read some of the stuff on your website, and my guess is you're looking to bring some of those folks aboard who can help build the code for that. And, look, I'm calling you totally out of the blue, but we work with a number of folks who are looking to add experience engineering talent. And I'm wondering if you you might be open to talking more when I'm when I'm not totally cold calling you out of the blue. Here's another question from Chris Baule, who's also in the recruiting staff industry. A lot of people feel like all staffing companies are the same, and they all they've already got providers in place. So this sounds like an objection. Like, we've already got a solution. We've already got a provider. What do we do if someone says that after we've given our problem proposition? The key to all competitors and existing solutions is you have to find the one thing the one thing you do differently that other people suck at, and you need to ask them a question that gets them to think about that. So I'll give you an example. And, again, this is off the cuff, so let's see if I I can actually do this. You know, Bets Recruiting is not a sponsor. Bets Recruiting is a sales specific recruiting agency. Mhmm. K? Sales specific. They help you recruit salespeople. And so if I was calling Will and I knew Will was trying to hire salespeople, which would be in my ICP, then here's what it would sound like. He says, I'm working with insert random recruiting agency here that's not specialized in sales. I'm gonna say, oh, you work with insert random recruiting agency. Honestly, I I've talked to a lot of folks working with them, and it rarely makes sense to switch. Just so I make sure no one from my team calls you again, you're I imagine you're able to see their OTE, their attainment, and all their, like, past sales performance and all that stuff. Right? So notice what I did. I know Betts Recruiting has the OTE expectations, the past attainment, the sales performance, and I know most other recruiters don't have that because they're not specialized in sales. And so I'm gonna be like, you you don't you don't have a problem with this. Right? I'm almost assuming that he's got it taken care of, and he'll be like, no. But and now I can start to educate him a little bit, and I can be like, oh, honestly, Will, chances are you're probably still not gonna switch recruiters. But, like, one of the things that makes us a little bit different from other recruiters is we're specialized in sales. And I noticed you had three job postings, and you probably have a million applications. And it would be nice to be able to sort those all your applicants by what their actual attainment was. Are you open to taking a look at this thing if for no other reason you know it's out there? Mhmm. And so my goal is, number one, fry a hole poke a hole with a trap question. Get Will to think about the gap and the solution today. And then notice what I did. I sold the test drive at the end of it. It's called selling the test drive, not the car. You're probably gonna stick with your existing solution, but are you open to taking a look at this thing just so you know it's out there? Could I at least show you what it looks like to look at a repotainment report? There is one person here who has a question specifically for you, Armand. You said, hey. We work with a few other x. What if you don't have any customers or any really book things that you can mention there? Are you gonna lie? Are you gonna say you do when you don't? What's the deal? If you're using, like, the heard the name tossed around opener and you don't have any common thread between your customers and their customers, in the rare case that you literally have zero customers, which is probably not the case, rely on investors, design partners, etcetera, but that is usually not the case. So what I recommend doing is similar to how Nick said, have a stack rank of your top five things that you can look for about them and press release, etcetera. If you're using the Heard the Name tossed around, have a stack rank of your top five forms of commonality that you could cite. So, for example, I would always go for same investor first and then same coworkers and then same situation. You could even say we work with a bunch of other chief people officers that are in the tech space. The more specific you can get, the better. The real money move is almost everyone has a couple of at least generic ones. Like, we work with other people in New York, and we work with a couple other chief people officers. The way you can make that more specific is you can say, hey. We work with a bunch of other chief people officers in New York. And now by combining two or three forms of commonality, I get you to sit up. Right? And so I know Nick lives in Pasadena, and I can say, hey. I work with a bunch of folks in the sales space and and know a bunch of folks who are out in Pasadena too. It's Arman from thirty MPC. Have you heard her name tossed around? Just by getting that close to home, I get this sit up moment versus, hey. We work with a couple other people who breathe. That's what's not very exclusive. We work with a couple of other VPs. Yeah. VPs. So you've added one extra thing to make us slightly more relevant. I love that. We've got time for one more question. Someone said here, I'm in the higher ed space, and a lot of people are super busy right now. The most common objection they're hearing is, I'm sorry. I'm busy right now. How are you gonna handle that? We can even role play. Ring ring. I'm real busy right now. I'm real busy right now. But you had the time to say it twice, Will, so I I appreciate you taking that much time alone. I should have assumed. I know we got school starting and all that stuff, and and you're probably completely swamped. Just so no one from my team calls you again, is it that you guys are just totally swamped right now because it's busy season and school is about to start, or are you just like a crazy lean team and every single day, you're, like, closing the phone or closing the laptop at nine? I just don't have time to be taking calls like this. That's all. Yeah. Completely understand. And, Will, you can be completely honest with me. How much of it is the fact that you're completely swamped right now or my pitch just sort of sucked and you might not like getting cold calls? And it's okay if my pitch sucked. Look. There are a million different ed tech companies trying to call me, so I I I it it's a little bit of both, I'll be honest. I am busy, but I'm probably not interested in my BSLO. For sure. I mean, look. The the reason that I reached out to you specifically is because most folks who are running school programs, they can't stand it, and they're freaking swamped because they're trying to get all of their tutors to match up with all of their students on a daily basis, and you're coordinating all these tutors yourself. Like, those are actually the customers that tend to be the best fit for us. Are you open to me throwing a hold on the counter? Not now, but, like, in four weeks once school starts and all that stuff just so you can take a look and get a sense of what's out there. This is a hard one. This is, like, a 33% chance of me actually booking this meeting. So first thing is I broke the pattern hard. So Will said I'm busy twice. I'm cracking a joke. Second thing is he just kept trying to swap me away. Again, I need to find the objection. I split his objection. And so I said, look. Is it is it actually the timing thing, or is it my cold call just sucked and you have no interest? And he was still giving me, like, nothing. I'm probably, like, on thin ice at this point. So all I'm gonna do, because he's really not giving me anything, is I've gotta shoot my best trap question across. And that's what I did. Is I'm like, look. The reason that I reached out to you is because I'm assuming you have this type of problem. You're probably not gonna buy this. I'm gonna remove the pressure of the sale. In four weeks, would you take a look at this thing? Not for now, but for down the road. So that's, like, all you can do. And, again, like, I don't even have a tutoring software or anything like that. I'm just totally, like, off the cuff, but it's it's a game of playing the odds at that point. I like your point. There is no silver bullet here. All All we can do is do approaches that are gonna make it more likely like you did there. You agreed to me. You made a joke. You tried to diffuse. You took another shot at the problem proposition, maybe tweak that problem prop a little bit, and hopefully get them hooked on that. But that's not always gonna work.
