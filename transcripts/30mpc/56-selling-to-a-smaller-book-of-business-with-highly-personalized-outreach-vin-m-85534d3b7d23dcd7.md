## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have not the one, not the two, but the three time SDR of the year over at Demandbase, now a mid market AE, and one of the best prospectors we've ever met, Vin Matano. Nick, why should people listen? Well, I like booking meetings on the phone, and this guy's sort of the inverse. He's got such good tactics around booking meetings on email. This was one of those shows where I came away, and I was like, this guy knows how to prospect. It was a really good one. Three, two, one. Such good tactics. Today's show was brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, Vin. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. My top three takeaways are using the prospecting checklist, multichannel prospecting, and creating internal champions. So I'll break it down. Prospecting checklist is something that I used, kinda created when I first started off prospecting. I found there was, like, three main things that I was always using within all my emails. And I was seeing a lot of opens, a lot of replies. And what that was was the first thing I was looking for was, a personal. Right? That's the first category. Personal is something that you're using for that you're gonna use reaching out to the individual. Right? So you're gonna spend time on their LinkedIn. You can Google search their your prospect's name. Try to find stuff that'll actually, one, align to why you're reaching out, and two, just really just to grab their attention. The other thing I would look for is personalizing it based off the company. So by spending time on the company website or the company LinkedIn page, you can find a lot of relevant things that are coming out in terms of news, whether it's a, you know, product release, funding, or even a web redesign. Right? Those are things that I'll look for typically. And the last thing I'll look for is I'll go in my CRM. I think the CRM is a place where there's tons and tons of great data, and we may often overlook that. So I'll look for, you know, recent closed lost opportunities or just recent conversations just so I can tie that into the conversation. So that's what I'm really using to formulate all my emails. And in 2020, I had a 77% open rate and a 18.6% reply rate. Jeez. Better than me. What's number two? Number two is multichannel prospecting. So, you know, as you guys know, it's extremely hard to just focus on one channel. You know, if you're leveraging just email or just, you know, phone like Nick's doing, you really have to use different channels. So, typically, what people are doing is they're using email, voice mail, and an InMail. I think that's what most organizations are doing. I think Topo reported about 80% of high growth companies are doing this. For me, I like to actually leverage, Twitter. I sell to marketers, and marketers are often really, really active on Twitter. For me, it's a place where I can find a balance of both personal and professional things that I can use in my outreach. It's also another channel for me to reach out towards. So when I use my prospecting checklist to actually formulate my emails, I'll actually go to Twitter and reach out to them directly. One, to get my name across to them, and two, really just to get them to open my email. Oftentimes, I'll often create a video and just send it to them over Twitter. There's less noise. They're probably gonna click it because they're not really getting that many people tweeting at them. And for me, it's highly effective. Alright, Vin. Round us out. What's number three? Last is creating internal champions. Pretty sure I learned this from your show, so I'm not even I'll give you guys credit here. But, really, this is helping me get more multi threaded in my deals. I think I learned this from you guys. Reply alts after demos or discos, but then actually create separate threads with each each individual stakeholder. I use Gong to reference a specific quote that that individual said. We wanna make sure that they got their questions answered and then send them resources that would apply to what they had asked. I'll I'll leave a call to action trying to get one on one time with everybody within the buying committee. And, again, that helps me get internal champions, and that helps the deals actually accelerate faster. Boom. And there we got the three. And I know you got a bunch of tactics around territory carving, which probably leads into how you're tailoring your emails. So could you talk a little bit about what accounts get what level of tailoring or attention from you? Yeah. So for me, how I'm doing that is, Demandbase actually helps kinda rank and score these accounts. But on my own, what I'm doing is I'm looking for a technology stack. Do they have marketing automation? That's something that's important. Are they on Salesforce? That's important for me as I'm selling. How large is their marketing team? That's something that I'm looking for. Are they gonna be able to leverage a tool like Demandbase? And lastly, have we chatted with them before? I wanna know if there's recent closed lost opportunities or not because that's gonna tell me a lot of good information. Have they looked into us in the past? If it was closed lost, why did it closed lost? Was it timing? Was it budget? This is all information that I need to rank and score my accounts. So when I'm looking to personalize, I know which accounts I need to get more love versus maybe more templated messaging. There we go. And then once you've gotten them tiered out, give me a general sense. Like, I've seen some people where it's like, yeah. I got 300 accounts, 250 are a tiers. Right? And so, like, my guess is you have, like, a nice mix there. Like, what what's a good mix of, like, your a's, b's, and c's? For me, I think, at Demandbase, we break it up, but we have an AE top 30. So those are, like, my 30 top accounts. Right? I may have a few 100 that's in my name, quote, unquote. And then from there, we'll we'll choose a top five. From there, you know, we'll have a lot of accounts that are outstanding. We may have, like, 20 accounts that are in this, like, tier one, tier two, tier three outside of the AE top 30. So that's how we're going thinking about it. Bonus points if you guys can leverage anything like intent data or web activity, that'll help you guys get a more good understanding of, like, where are they at in their buyer's journey, which which helps, you know, when when should I reach out to these accounts? Then one of the things I'm curious about is, like, the past activity and the past history that you've had with accounts because I've certainly used oh, you talked to someone at my company three years ago as a ledge to start a conversation. Can you talk about what sort of past activity you're looking for and then how you use that to break into account that you haven't talked to before? Sure. Yeah. So I'm looking automatically at, past opportunities. And I'm hopefully, you know, the previous AE actually put some notes in there so I can go look in there, actually grab some things that they talked about. So for example, if I'm reaching out to a closed loss account and the individuals in there that that they spoke with, I'll reach back out to them and say, like, you know, hey, Stacy. I saw you chatted with my colleague, Matt. Back in 2020, you guys talked about x, y, and z. Curious to see how things progressed, and then I'll go into kinda like that pitch and the call to action, so to speak. It it's pretty light. It's a soft touch. It's really easy to to create. It doesn't take a lot of time, and it's highly effective. It's probably one of my most, highest percentage in terms of open rates for my my, my templates. Well, one thing we used to just wreak havoc on when I was at Carta is if you're on Outreach or SalesLoft, all of your prospect messages should be coming into Salesforce. And so what you're able to do is if you look at your Salesforce activity logs for every account, you can just look at every email that's been sent inbound from the prospect. And so quickly by skimming every single response that a prospect has ever given you, you can immediately say, oh, this person told me to f off and call back in six months. And now you can say, hey. You asked me to call back in six months, and now I'm here. And so the gold is in the CRM because that's what they exactly what they asked you to do. There's so much good stuff in the CRM, and and and reps often just forget to look there. Just like you said, one thing I'll do is filter by inbound emails in my CRM, and actually grab pieces of their conversation, literally copy and paste whatever they said into my email. That way I'm speaking their language. I'm I I can't get it wrong there. And then, again, I'm tying back, you know, why did why now is a better time to reach back out. Well, can we talk about that quote thing? Because you talked about that also with the multithreading piece. You're, like, taking a specific quote from the Gong recording. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Yeah. So, you know, for example, if, you know, I've I'm doing a demo and maybe a prospect asks, like, hey. You know, I just have some questions about your advertising solution, a really specific question. I'll literally copy that from the transcript or just copy it, you know, type it out, paste it in there, say, hey. I know you had a question specifically about our advertising solution and what kind of publishing networks we use. I wanna make sure we answer your question. Then I attach the resources that would answer that question and then try to ask, you know, my call to action would be trying to get some time one on one to actually talk specifically about advertising. So my goal really is to get one on ones with with everybody in the buying committee. So you've got this top 30, and then you've got your top five. Like, what what kind of gold plated emails are you sending me your top five? Like, what what luxury treatment are you giving those folks versus your other standard A tier accounts? So when I work in my SDR, those the AE top five, like, the rule is we're not allowed to send templates to them. Like, that's just my rule that I created. We're not allowed to send any templated messaging to an AE top five account. So for me, I'm using my checklist to personalize every single email I'm sending out, And I'm also carrying that through different channels. So I'm not just gonna send an email. I'm gonna follow-up via Twitter. I'll create a you guys can go on my Twitter and check out the videos I've done. Like you literally can copy them. I'll go on Twitter, you know, call out the email that I sent. Usually I'm, I'm referencing something very personalized and there is often a reason why I'm reaching out. Send them that via Twitter. I won't ask for the meeting over Twitter. I'm just, my goal is to get them redirected back to my email because I'm confident in the email that I wrote that they're probably gonna answer there. So being very multi channeled and not using any sort of templating at all. One thing I always get torn up on is, I don't know, how big is your book of accounts, for example? I mean, there's about, there's like probably 300 accounts in my name. But really we're focused more or less on like, you know, my top accounts really. Right. And so you can blast through 300 accounts in a month pretty effectively, right? 50 accounts a week, give or take. You shouldn't do that. You should be more careful about it. But even over two months, you'll be able to work all of them. So what do you do when you've gone through your cadence, you've reached out to them three or four times? Do you have a process for reaching back out in a month, two months, recycling them? Like, how do you how do you approach that? Yeah. So that's a good question. I'm on the fence where I'm, my volume is very, very low because the quality that I'm putting out is very high. So, you know, I would never get through 300 accounts in a week or even a few weeks to be quite honest with you. So for me, you know, I'm taking my time writing these emails, reaching out to these accounts. I'll get to a point where maybe I've reached out four or five times, and then I'll recycle those accounts. For me, what I would do if if I sent a really great email, if for whatever reason they didn't open it, I'll literally copy and paste that same exact email with the new subject line later on. So I'm reusing some of the stuff that didn't get opened. I'm not letting that go to waste. Like, I spent time writing that. It's a good email. And for me, I'm I'm breaking up with my SDR. I'm saying, hey. You know, you take these maybe lower ranked accounts. They can do a little bit more volume than I can. Where me, I'm focusing solely on my top accounts, and I'm personalizing pretty much everything that I'm sending. That's so smart. If they don't open the email like, you do all this work to put together a really good email, and then I screw this up all the time. I'm like, oh, didn't get a reply. Guess I gotta start start from scratch. But if they never opened it, you're right. You should just reuse it with a different subject line. Yeah. Test it out. It's probably your subject line that's not good. Can you talk a little bit about some of your prospecting emails? Because I know I'm a big cold call guy, and I don't use email as much. I sprinkle it in there, and you're sort of the inverse. You were telling me earlier that, like, email is the number one way that you're booking meetings. So can you talk about your email approach? I literally I'm just I I rarely cold call. For me, email is highly effective, so I double down on it. For me, I start off every, you know, every email the same. Again, I'm going I'm I'm looking at something on their profile, my on my prospect's profile. I'm Google searching their name. There's this website. I think it's called Owletail that I actually you can use. You can plug in your prospect's name, and it'll surface all the podcasts that they're recently featured on. So if they're one of your target accounts and you, and you need to get a meeting with them, that's a platform that I would use to try to find a podcast they're featured on reference that podcast. Typically, if they're on, you know, for me, if they're on a marketing podcast, typically they're talking about marketing stuff that Demandbase can help with. So I just literally, again, I use the quotes of whatever they're saying in that podcast, right in my email. That's a highly effective email. So I try to get my emails to fit about three, you know, three lines, three paragraphs long. Sometimes they go longer. Sometimes they go shorter. My opening sentence, if I'm using a podcast that, Hey, I just listened to the podcast you recently featured on. Just open it right away. You want, you want your first sentence. You don't want to waste any time. You don't want to say, Hey, prospect. Hope you're having a great day. Hey, you're, you know, was looking at LinkedIn. No. Just say, hey, just listen to your podcast, name the podcast, link it so they know what you're talking about. Hey, I noticed you mentioned X, Y, and Z about marketing. Here's how demand based can help. Reference something that maybe has past conversation in the CRM on the bottom, the last third line paragraph. And then my call to action, I got this from Josh Braun. Either way, love the podcast episode. So one one, you know, if they say no, you made a really good impression on them. Chances are we could reach back out later on if timing is better. You'll have a better chance of getting that meeting. So what do you do when they reject you and they say, hey. Thanks for your email. Not interested. What's your approach? Because you you only have 300 or so accounts. Like, you're gonna get a bunch of not interesteds. To Arman's point earlier, like, what do you do to make sure that that account isn't dead in perpetuity? Yeah. So if they give me something like timing, I'll often say, to avoid playing cat and mouse, when's a better time to reach back out? Typically, they'll give me a reason why in a in a time point there. Then what we'll do is from there, I'll often then kind of offer up some, some kind of free services that like Demandbase can offer for us. We can kind of give some, data into their site traffic. That's something that I'll try to push in the meantime. So, hey, completely understand you guys aren't ready to look into a technology right now. If it would be helpful, and I use that as my line all the time, happy to offer some, you know, ways we can de anonymize your site traffic now. That way, when you're ready to think about a technology, you have all the data sets in place to plan that out. That sometimes helps me get in front of them well before they really need to even talk about technology. But that's usually my go to. In terms of the people you're working in the organization, because you have to be really tailored and make your territory last for a long time, are you hitting everybody from above the line to below the line? Are you carving out certain teams? How do you approach the people on an account? Yeah. Typically, if my SDR and I, when we're thinking about our top accounts, typically, I'll go for more of the higher, you know, director and above. However, sometimes my top, you know, 80 top five accounts, I'm reaching out to everybody from the account. If I sell into marketing, I'm reaching out to all the marketers from that from that top account because for me, I don't care who I talk to from that account. I just wanna get my foot in the door of my AE top five accounts. And you mentioned that you're recycling your accounts once you're done reaching out. What what does that mean? Is that is that literally just like the changing of the subject line process? Do you have marketing sending emails to them, or, like, how do you effectively recycle something so you don't just blast them again? Yeah. So I'm never blasting my accounts. So what I'm doing is that I'm get you know, if I'm hitting, like, four or five touches and and nothing, I'll just pause. I'll reach out to I'll start reaching out to my other accounts. And then in a month or so, I'll I'll start that cycle back up again. And, again, if there's if I have emails that are really good and there's zero opens, I'm gonna reuse those emails and change the subject lines. Or I may use those same messaging in different channels. I may reach out via LinkedIn or may reach out if all need be over the phone. I love what you're doing with, like, the listening to the podcast and the Twitter reach outs and, like, you're clearly doing a ton of research before you're prospecting. And I'm wondering if you can you can walk me through how you structured your time because it's really easy for me to get sucked down a rabbit hole where I'm trying to research my prospect, Armand, and and now I've listened to an entire season of thirty minutes to presidents club, and I haven't actually sent the email yet. Yeah. That could happen. Yeah. I often try to look for episodes that have show notes because then I can just command f. For me, we sell a platform that helps with account based marketing. So whenever a marketer's talking, I'll just command F in the show notes for account based marketing or ABM. Usually I'll find a nugget there and I'll actually have to listen to the whole episode. But now as an AE, I'm juggling my current deals that I am working versus I versus prospecting. Right? I still wanna make sure I'm prospecting every day. A minimum, I try to carve out an hour each day to prospect, and that's actual time I'm putting on my calendar, entire block. So for me, I'm I'm doing some prep work before my calls, my discos, and my demos. And then when I have time, I'm blocking actual time blocks for prospecting. And I'm letting my my SDR know when I'm actually prospecting. So that way, you know, we can piggyback off each other or I can actually, you know, let him know and we can kind of tag team accounts. Can you talk about the collaboration with your SDR a little bit more? You mentioned a couple times, sometimes you're dividing up an individual account into different prospects. And then other times you're saying you go after these accounts and I go after these ones. How do you work with your SDR effectively? We work extremely close. The funny thing about, prospecting as you guys know is, you know, you can write a great email or you can have a great cold call. For whatever reason, you just didn't get through. Someone else can come in two months later in territory exchange, and they just send a generic email and they get through. It's because the name is switching. So we try to switch the switch our outreach as much as we can. I'll reach out to an account. He'll reach out to an account. And what we're doing is we're meeting every Monday morning. We're planning out our our week. For us, we're picking 10 accounts each that we wanna reach out to that week. And for me, I'm focusing more on the top accounts, whereas my SDR, we're focusing maybe on the, you know, mid tier accounts. And then he can also use some things like, you know, templates to the lower tiered accounts if you need some more touches. How we're breaking up accounts is I'm typically focusing on director and above. If we're focusing on one account each, there's maybe there's one account that we're seeing a lot of intense signals from. In previous notes, they said, hey. Reach back out in q two, and it's q two right now. We need to just, like, go full volume onto this account. We'll divide and conquer. We'll actually say, hey. I'll be like, hey. You reach out to everyone director and below. I'll reach out to everyone director and above. Oftentimes, he'll actually maybe reach out to an account and cc me, and I'll come over the top. Sometimes that double touch actually was was helps get the response. Can you talk a little bit about the intense data and how that's informing your prospecting? Because when you say that, it makes me think of my first ever SDR job where I didn't know that existed, and nobody else at the company except for one SDR knew that, like, you could look at when people were on your website. And he was booking meeting after meeting after meeting. And I'm like, what the heck is this guy doing? And I look over at his computer one day, and he's, like, scrolling through Pardot. And I'm like, oh, this is it. Yeah. So intent intent data is kind of a big term. There's many definitions of intent. For us, we think about intent, keyword focus. So, you know, one of the things that demand base does not to plug demand base is we can look at which keywords are being researched throughout the web from our target accounts. So you can think about account based marketing platform as a as a keyword or maybe a competitor name, or you can look at web activity. Right? What, you know, what pick what product pages are they on? If for us, if, one of my target accounts came to our, you know, advertising related product pages or they came to our advertising related blog post, well, I'm gonna reach out with advertising related messaging. People aren't filling out forms anymore. So if we can see a web activity from the account level, we can then reach out proactively and not have to wait for them to come to us. So let's take a step in in another direction. You talk about the the scaling. Right? And a lot of times, people just get caught in the weeds one by one, account by account, and just slogging your way through things. Could you talk about how you scale your outreach effectively without, like, slogging through the weeds? Yeah. So I I get like, I literally get this question on probably every podcast because I talk a lot about how I personalize emails and everyone always asks, well, how do you scale that? And the answer is you're not supposed to scale that. Right? So when you look at that tiering model in place that you have, whether you're looking at revenue range, whether you're looking at, you know, technographics, whatever you care about, For me, I'm, I'm only taking time to do that to my top accounts. Whereas the bottom accounts, I'm not, I'm not personalizing at all. I'm maybe sending templates and having SDR reach out to them. So you're really not supposed to scale that. However, when you start to kind of get that system in place for me, I'm using the checklist. I know three things to look forward to send every single email that helps me get them out quicker. So when I talk about scaling for me, it's still not about like, you know, mass volume, but it's about, okay, how can I get this prospecting email out, this personalized email out quicker than normal? And And that's what I'm using. And, again, a lot of the stuff you can you can copy and paste. You know, I have a template that's for all my closed lost opportunities. Essentially, just all that asked me to do is put in the quote for why the the opportunity closed. So some stuff like that is is is quicker ways to get emails out and not have to bang your head against the wall. So could you talk about this a little bit more? Because you you mentioned that before you're copying over the same email from before, and you're doing all this really good research upfront. And it sounded like you had some systems to make sure you don't do the same research again when you're reaching out to an account again. And so are you using anything unique like tags when you know a company falls in a certain bucket or anything at all so that when you're ready to work an account again, you don't have to just restart your entire research process again? Yeah. It's super old school, but I actually have a I actually use a Excel doc that me and my SDR share. It's very old school, but it for me, it's super effective because, you know, if I found an article, like, for example, if your if your company reaching out to is a public company, you can break right into their 10 ks and chances are they're gonna share their challenges. They're gonna share, you know, their marketing objectives. At least that's what I look for. And I'll literally link that in my Excel doc. So when I'm reaching out, I know I'm already referencing that. And chances are I'll use that messaging for so many emails. Hey. I read in your 10 k that you guys are really, you're getting competitive headwinds, and I wanna share some ways how the main base can help you guys get in front of your competitors. I'll literally use that as my call to action for all my emails because it's tailored. Now my job is to just get them to open it, and that's where the prop you know, some of the prospecting checklist comes into play. Getting them to open the email is key. Once they read that little call to action at the end that I reference from their 10 k, I'm confident I'll get a response. You've referenced a couple times, like, how closely you work with your SDR from the Monday morning meeting you're having to how you guys will tag team these accounts. And I'm curious if you've got any best practices around, like, the SDR to AE handoff, because I've seen it botched at a lot of companies, and I'm wondering if you're doing anything unique. Yeah. I mean, I've been on both sides of the coin, so I've been the SDR and I've and now I I'm the AE. I think the best hand offs, are actually including the AE. Whenever the SDR gets a response, including the AE on that email thread. So they see the name, obviously, referencing and introducing the AE in the thread prior to the meeting. And for me, I'm trying to send, you know, resources prior to that first meeting. So, again, they know who I am. And the best calls is when the SDR opens it, introduces the AE so it's smooth. And, those are the ones that are the probably the smoothest handoffs. Okay. So you're sending material in advance of the meeting. Can you talk a little bit about that? Because that's kinda unique. Yeah. So if they had actually, you know, shared some, hey. We're actually interested in x, y, and z. We're really we really wanna know about this. We're actually planning for that. I will send them those resources that are very high level just to give them an idea of what they're actually we're gonna be talking about today. And I often do that for the demos as well. You know, we have a sales related tool as well that we sell to sales folks. At that point in the sales process, when they bring on their sales folks, I'll send those, like, preliminary, you know, sales resources so the sales team understands what, you know, what the heck they're looking at. And then after the call, we have some more, like, in-depth sales resources that I can send them that now they know what it is, and here's some stuff that would would kinda aid the demo. Right. And what's kinda cool about that is they have now seen your name, and you've corresponded an email. You're not just, like, the AE who showed up and was like, oh, we we've got a meeting. Let me ask you the same questions the SDR asked you on the phone call. Like, you're kind of piquing their interest in having the meeting. Yeah. For sure. And I'll I'll often engage with them on on, like, LinkedIn or if they're on Twitter. And for me, I don't really use LinkedIn to to book meetings. I'm using it to engage with them. You know, as I mentioned earlier, everything is going through email for me. Like, I'm literally using that as my main channel, but I'm going to LinkedIn. I'm adding them on LinkedIn. I'm commenting on their posts. You know, if they shared a, you know, recent funding on LinkedIn, which like people do, I'll comment congrats on the funding. But then in my email, I'm actually trying to get the meeting. So, again, anything I can do to get my my face in front of them. So when they see an email come from Vin Mitano, they know who I am and they recognize my face. Well, what a lot of people do, they screw up is, I'm gonna try to sell you on the phone. I'm gonna try to sell you on LinkedIn. I'm gonna try to sell you on email, and it's like, get the hell away from me. I don't wanna be like, everywhere I go, you're just, like, creepy. On Twitter, you're trying to sell them. But instead, what I find that the best reps do, like, I booked a ton of meetings where I'm just, like, commenting on someone's job change or I'm commenting on a post they made, but then they see the cold email. Right? And so I'm I'm letting work be work, and I'm on LinkedIn be LinkedIn, but I'm not harassing you on all fronts, but you know why I'm commenting. It's a little bit more subtle. Absolutely. And you're building that relationship with them. For me, people, like, people know I'm very active on on on social, so they'll ask, like, how do you, you know, how do you use LinkedIn to book meetings? And I and I always say I never. I never do. I never use LinkedIn to book meetings. I never use Twitter to book meetings. All I'm using them for is to get their attention back to my email that I formulated because I spent so much time on it. Yeah. Same deal for me, man. There's a lot of crazy about social selling. I'm a little bit old school in this and, like, video selling and all that stuff. Don't get me wrong. All those things are really great, but 99 of my stuff still comes from phone and email. But that doesn't mean the stuff on LinkedIn and Twitter is helping. It's just indirectly influencing that stuff. Oh, absolutely. I I wish there was metrics on that because I'd I'd I'd I would die. I would, I would die on that hill. Well, man, this has been phenomenal. This has been one of those shows where I'm like, this guy gets it when it comes to prospecting. It's got me excited to get tweeting again. But, we're running out of time, so we gotta move to the final question. And the final question's has been we've talked about some really good habits and things people should be incorporating into their sales life. Now we gotta talk about a bad habit. So my question for you is what is one bad habit that you think all salespeople need to break, stop doing because it's hurting them more than it's helping? Relying on their SDR for meetings. That's, like, the number one thing you can tell if if a if a rep is struggling is because they're relying on their SDR to book meetings. For me, coming from an SDR, and I think most salespeople, you know, at this point in time are coming from that SDR position where they have that muscle, they know how to flex it. They're gonna be prospecting forward. And if you're relying on your SDR, it's you're gonna be in a really bad position. For me, I try to I try to own at least one third of all opportunities, one third of all revenue that I sourced. And for me, that just helps me have a a strong foundation to build upon. So that's the one thing that I say that reps need to really forget about is stop just relying solely on your SDR for everything. I love it, man. This has been phenomenal. Anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? Nothing, man. Just keep listening to thirty minutes of Presidents Club, the best sales podcast out right now, and these guys are the man. Well, there you go. Vin won't plug himself, but I will. Go follow this guy on LinkedIn. Connect with him. Try to sell him some leads. Send him a creepy video. It'll make his life. But, thanks for coming on, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Vin Metano include, number one, you got your AE top 30 and your AE top five. And those are your a tier accounts. No templated messaging on all those folks, but you can recycle the bodies of the email if you change the subject line. Number two, so you've got all of this activity that's coming in through your CRM. Do not just go on to their website and do a research. Look at every inbound email that's come into an account. Take quotes from those emails and use those to send out new cold emails. Number three, recycle that same email that didn't get an open the first time with a new subject line. You don't have to reinvent the wheel every single time. You can reuse that research. And then lastly, number four, switch your outreach frequently. Sometimes coming over the top as an AE while your SDR is reaching out on CC is a great thing. Other times, an SDR might reach out to an account that you've you you've reached out to 20 times, and they break through because it's a different name. So change patterns frequently. You can break up an account between your directors and above and your directors and below, or you can break up multiple accounts between your AEs and your SDRs. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us? Yesterday, I went for a nice bike ride, and I listened to a couple episodes of thirty minutes to president's club, but I thought, dang. That show deserves five stars. So if you haven't rated our show on Apple or Spotify or wherever you listen to this, if you wouldn't mind giving us five stars, it would warm my heart and soul. And we'll see you next week on thirty minutes of Presidents Club.
