## Transcript

It is absolutely insane to me that we spend months and months onboarding reps, usually unsuccessfully, but we spend literally less than a minute onboarding a new manager. I have yet to meet a manager in my entire sales career that said, oh, yeah. I was onboarded and trained to do this job, and I know exactly what I'm doing when I'm walking into it. Zero sales managers have ever done that. Why? It's very simple. We think that because somebody is a great rep that they'll automatically know how to be a great manager, but there's almost not two more different jobs than doing sales and leading sales. Here's a couple of examples of things that managers get wrong all the time. They're guessing at forecasting. Nobody showed them how to do it. They're just trying to do something to get people off their back. They just guess and they end up missing. Nobody on their team actually does the stuff that they train them on. They'll hold a cold call training, they'll check-in two weeks later and nobody's doing it the way that the training suggested that they do it. And the last is hiring. You keep talking yourself into people that you know you shouldn't hire and having to deal with it on the backside for months and months after that. The best sales managers I know, they have an operating system. They've developed a way to be able to manage their people to the outcomes and results that they want. Now you can take years to learn this or you can use my sales management operating system that has three parts. One is the operating system. For example, how do you get an AE to prospect to fill your pipeline? The second part is the operating rhythm. How do we hold them accountable to the systems? In other words, how do you tell a rep if they're on or off course of the prospecting initiative I just launched? And lastly, is your talent system. How do you stock your team full of people that will live by the rhythms and work according to the systems? They will be the people that will do the prospecting that you want them to do to get the results you need to get. So you might be wondering, who the heck is this guy to be teaching this leadership course? Hey hey, everybody. I'm Mark Casaglow. In case we haven't met yet, I was the first employee at Outreach and led them to $250,000,000 in less than eight years. I then doubled Catalyst revenue in fourteen months, and now I'm currently the CRO of a publicly traded company. But listen, those are all great. That's not how it started. The way it started was I just gotten hired for my first regional sales director's job. I was the youngest regional sales director by almost ten years, and I fell behind the eight ball. And I still remember the exact day when I realized two months in, I have no clue what I'm doing. I'm forecasting by making up my numbers to make sure nobody is pissed at me. I'm trying to figure out how to get my reps to cold call when I know that they're actually not. I'm trying to run team meetings and I'm watching people fall asleep during them. That's when I said, I gotta go to work. I gotta figure this out because I'm about to get fired. So what did I do? I started to form my own perspective on what it was to be a great sales leader by talking to mentors, reading books. And that's how I created this sales management operating system. This is literally the same exact system that I used for my career and now eight other of my managers have used to get their first VP and SVP jobs. So let me break this sales management operating system down for you. There's three parts. Part one is the operating systems. This is where we do four things. One, what is the sales process that we use to push deals through the pipeline? Two, how do we communicate how that progress is going by forecasting accurately? Three, how do we do the deal reviews that make sure that all of our data that we're reporting on is accurate and our reps are thinking about things the way that we want them to according to the processes we've put in place. Four, AE prospecting. That's how we stuff the pipeline with tons of deals so that you can forecast and move them through the pipeline and do the deal reviews on them. Section two is the operating rhythm. The operating rhythm is how you hold your team accountable and root into them the systems of your operating system. First, we do coaching and training. That's where we determine what do we need to teach our team, and then how do we do it in a way that actually affects their behavior. Number two is team meetings. How do we build camaraderie? How do we build a culture? Where do we talk about the stuff that we need to talk about as a team without boring our reps and making them think I can just skip the team meeting this week? Number three, one on ones. How do you build deep personal connections with people that earns you the right to ask them to do hard work and to have hard conversations? And number four, metrics. In order to know what is in the content of all these meetings, you have to be able to understand the data so that you can make the right decisions to fill all of these meetings with the stuff that's gonna move your team closer to success. And section three is your talent system. Listen, you can have the best systems and the best rhythm in the world. If you have bad talent, it won't go. And I might even argue that if you have great talent, your system and your rhythm don't even have to be that great. But how do you stock your team with great talent? One, you identify your candidate ICP and you interview them in a way to make sure that they have the qualities required to be a success. Two, you make sure you source great candidates. You don't wait on inbound and your recruiters to send you great people. You go get them and put them on your bench. And number three, is you figure out how to onboard those people correctly. You give them that smooth on ramp into the highway of success that your rhythm and your systems create. Your operating system is your sales process, and then we'll talk about the operating rhythms to reinforce the sales process. So what is wrong with most sales processes? Most sales processes are meeting based, meaning we're running from a discovery call, to a demo, to a proposal, to negotiations, and we're not actually taking the buyer along with us. They're seller centric, not buyer centric. And so oftentimes what'll happen is a seller will think, after this discovery call, I should schedule a demo call, or after this demo call, I should schedule a proposal call. And the reason that's a mistake is because why in the world would you schedule a demo call if on the discovery call, the prospect said, I agree to the problem. I pretty much think you're the vendor of choice. Just give me the price so I can sign this thing. You can actually speed your deals up if you don't force yourself into a five meeting sales cycle. Or why would you schedule a demo call if at the end of the first discovery call, they didn't even agree that they had a problem they could solve? You might actually have to do two or three more calls in discovery to get them to admit to a problem before you go into demo. And so instead, what Mark talks about is he talks about five agreements that every prospect needs to go through. What are those five agreements? There's the problem agreement. First of all, do you have a problem that we can solve? The second is a priority agreement. Is this a big enough problem to solve right now? The third is the evaluation agreement. Can we agree on how we're gonna evaluate all the vendors and all the options so that you can make a decision? The fourth is the value agreement. Do you actually agree that I can create the value I claim to create? And number five is the commercial agreement. Can we agree on a price that that value is worth paying for? And here's the trick folks, is you can get all five of those agreements in one call or in an enterprise sale, you might have to spend five calls getting value agreement. But if you think about what am I trying to get out of my prospect, what am I trying to get my prospect to agree to, the calls or the meetings are just tools to drive your sales cycle forward. And so that way, you don't end up having random meetings for the sake of having meetings. You take the most efficient path to drive your deal forward. So here's how this operating system around your sales process ties to your forecasting operating system. All you're gonna do is for each one of your stages, you're gonna rank every deal with four levels of risk from red to orange to yellow to green. What would an example of red level risk look like in stage one? So stage one is problem agreement. We're trying to agree that there's a problem. Red would be where it's not actually a problem, it's a preference. For example, we don't really like our reps on the phone, so we'd rather send more emails. That's not a business problem. That just sounds like somebody's opinion. If that's the problem we're basing our whole deal on, that's high risk red. We're gonna lose that deal if that doesn't change. What about orange? Orange means that if we don't change something, this deal is probably gonna push even though they're telling us it's gonna close on time. So if I'm in the problem agreement stage, an example of that might be, you know what? We need to make sure that we increase our pipeline coverage. That's very vague. Right? There's a lot of things that have to do with pipeline coverage. Pipeline coverage is a huge concept. Therefore, I would think that we might have to spend more time figuring out what they actually wanna buy on, which will elongate the sales cycle, hence, orange push. So then what would yellow be? Our yellow means that there's risk in the deal, but that we can get over it to win the deal. An example of that might be something like a project rather than a business initiative. So for example, an SDR leader might say something like, you know what? I really want my team to call more, and it's a specific thing for that specific group and not a wider business problem. That means that we could probably use that and massage that to get to something that's green. And what green means is green is there's no risk. We're ready to go. This is gonna happen. That might look like something like, we need to take our pipeline coverage from 1.2 x, which is gonna cause us to miss our number to get to three x. So you have your five stage sales process and then you have your four levels of forecasting risk. And then all you have to do to put together your forecast is you take your green deals, which are your locked no risk deals, plus your yellow deals, which are your best case deals that you think you'll win, plus everything that you think you will create and close within the quarter. And that's how you find your forecast. And then from there, the difference between your forecast and your goal is your gap. And the way that you close your gap is you take all of those orange deals, those red deals, plus everything else in pipeline or things that you can go and prospect for, and you try to pull those deals into the forecast. And that's how you take control of your number. And now you just need an operating rhythm to make sure that your reps are adhering to the operating system. And that's what many of you know as a pipeline review or a deal review. And here's how you run one of those. A deal review is your chance to make sure that reps are thinking about your sales process and how to forecast accurately while also making sure that your data is accurate inside your systems and giving reps a list of things that they can do to move deals forward that week that align to your sales process. So step one in the deal review is let's verify the forecast data. Let's take them through the different parts, the date, the stage, the amount, and make sure that what they have in CRM is accurate. Then we assess risk. We see, alright, is this red, orange, yellow, or green? Are we actually gonna have a chance to win this deal or not according to the way that we think about assessing risk because of our sales process? And then lastly is we plan next steps. That's where we give that rep a list of things that they can go do that week that move the deal forward, and we can make sure it's aligned to our sales process. This is how you make sure that what you define as a yellow risk deal or a red risk deal is the same as what a rep defines as a yellow risk deal or a red risk deal in practice. In other words, you make sure that the system is actually taking place in reality using the operating rhythm. So the final piece is now I need to make sure that I have the right talent on board that is coachable enough to be able to grasp these operating systems and be coached through the deal review rhythm. That's exactly right. So we need to have a talent system that allows us to see, does somebody have the coachability trait that allows them to understand how we do our systems? One way you might do that is to say, for example, hey, Armand. What is the most likely objection that you'd get in a deal cycle? Someone saying call me in six months because it's not a priority now. Call me in six months. Now what I would do is I do a role play with Armand around, hey, let me object to you, like, call me back in six months and let me see how you overcome it. I'm looking for nonverbal cues that he does or doesn't wanna enter into the role play. I'll give him coaching after the role play's over and then ask him, can we redo the role play using that coaching? And then I watch to see, can he use the coaching? Is his brain breaking? Is he's trying to change his behaviors in real time based on the feedback I gave him? If a rep is able to do that, then they're more than likely able to be coached into using the sales process that helps us forecast more accurately. You're basically running a mock deal review and seeing, if I were to run a deal review with you today, would you be able to adapt to coaching, or would I be banging my head against the table because you cannot take proper deal coaching? So folks, that's just like one example of an operating system that we put in place, but there are tons of other systems that we'll cover inside of the course, whether it's the five stage sales process, the forecasting, the AE prospecting process, the hiring process, pretty much everything you could possibly need to be a sales leader is covered in this course. So let's answer some questions that are probably on your mind. So a common question that people probably have is what if I already have a sales process or I already have a sales methodology? It's perfectly okay if you already have your own sales process. That may be a module that's not as important for you if you already have a great sales process. But you can still use the AE prospecting operating system in order to stuff that sales process with deals. You can use the talent system in order to hire great reps that will use that sales process to win deals. You'll be able to use your operating rhythm to make sure that you're driving home, that this is how we move deals through the pipeline. So it doesn't matter if you have something good in one of these modules. The other modules will help you make sure that you double down on the goodness you already have. How do I know this is gonna work for, like, my company, my industry? Like, I work in a very particular space with a specific kind of buyer or seller type. I sold ads for a student note taking service at a college in Pennsylvania using this system. I sold credit cards online using a similar version of this system. I sold paper planners to kids at schools using this system. I sold SAS to people using at this system. I have sold a lot of different things in a lot of different industries. All of those different places used to inform this system. Doesn't matter what you sell. Selling is sales. How do I know that this is gonna work for my sales process where maybe I work for SMB sales and it's super fast or maybe I work for enterprise sales and the deals are really big? What we've taught here are very specific things, but we've taught also the underlying principles of them of why they work. You should be able to take your specific situation in your industry segment or sales cycle and use those principles to then apply what we've taught to work inside your specific circumstances. And is this like a beginner course or is it for people who already have management experience? Listen, there's one zero one and two zero one aspects to this course. There's one zero one stuff like how to run a team meeting. That's something that is pretty basic. Some people have an idea of how they wanna do it, but I doubt many people have actually been trained on how to do it. So you might learn or add something. But then there's two zero one and three zero one stuff. For example, how we do forecasting is pretty advanced in this module. And what you can do there is you can take aspects of it or you can take the whole thing, but that would be something that most companies, even if they are pretty advanced, could benefit from from seeing how it's done in a different way. So, folks, if you're still on the fence, I wanna share my personal experience working with Mark. I have learned more from Mark in three years of working with him than I have in my entire career working with other sales leaders. And the reason for that is he truly breaks things down in a step by step process from first principles. I was a 29 year old VP of sales, and I think I did some things right, but the reality is I made a lot of mistakes along the way. I made a ton of hires off of gut, and I would see these shiny resumes. I'd be like, this person's from Salesforce. Like, I guarantee they're gonna figure it out. And the next thing you know, three months later, I'd be like, holy smokes. Like, I thought I tested for everything and this person actually couldn't sell. And then I would get people on board and I would have them start to do deal reviews and I would start to forecast with them. And I found myself over forecasting in an economic downturn. And literally, it was like the barber exercise of, like, I would start at a 100, and then it would go to, like, ninety and eighty and seventy. And part of the reason for that was because I didn't give my reps a super clear way to say that this should be a no risk, low risk, medium risk, or high risk forecast. And I also didn't know how to, like, properly account for things like the fact that a lot of your deals don't even exist at the beginning of the quarter. And I was just sort of, like, throwing numbers in the air when it came to forecasting. And so there are a million one, like, different things that I had to figure out from the beginning. And so the reason that Mark actually became cohost of the show is I was like, dude, I honestly want an excuse to just ask you questions every single week so I could figure this stuff out that I had to learn the hard way. And this course, if I had it when I first started as a sales manager, I would have had a million times of an easier run as a VP of sales because I would have known how to forecast. I would have known how to run deal reviews. I would have avoided a lot of hiring mistakes, and this breaks down literally everything you could possibly need to be a sales leader in under five hours. He has a repeatable process to make people not just good managers, but world class leaders, and that is exactly what this course is about. So, folks, our last offer for you here is if for some reason you take this course and you are not 100% satisfied, there is a 100% money back guarantee. You can just send us a quick email. We will not ask a single question, and you will get every single dollar that you spent back on this course. That is how much conviction that I have that this is the best sales leadership course you will ever take in the game. So if you like what you heard here, folks, go check it out. We'll see you on the inside.
