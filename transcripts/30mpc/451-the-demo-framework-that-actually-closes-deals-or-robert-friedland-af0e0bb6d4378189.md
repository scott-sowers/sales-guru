## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my host, Nick Sigelski. And, folks, this is an episode that is very near and dear to my heart. It is possibly the best demo episode we have ever done, and it comes from someone that actually worked on my team back at the Pave Days. Rob Friedland was previously the field CTO over at Sisense. He then joined me when I was the VP of sales at Pave to run all of solutions architecture where he started as a sales engineer. He led that entire team, and then he also managed all of solutions architecture for pre and post sales. And now he is the go to market execution lead over at Squint. Nick, why should people listen? So in this episode, you should expect to learn from Rob why you should ignore what is on your screen and why you should not be explaining what you are showing. He'll also talk about how you can craft the story of the impact that your product has, and he'll give you a framework for how to do that. And we'll give some great examples, some ridiculous ones about how you might demo a ChapStick holder, and then we got into some real ones around stuff like analytics, dashboards, integrations, etcetera. We also talk about what you should do when you're asked about features that you do not have, and we also get into the details on how you can think about breaking your one demo into 15 mini demos and then assign those mini demos different value stories. So if you are looking to uplevel the product demonstrations that you are showing as a way to improve your close rate, this is one to listen to. And, folks, Rob is the single best sales engineer I have worked with in my life. So I hope you enjoy this one. And a three, two, one. Let's roll. Alright, Rob. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Number one is demo the why. So whenever you're selling a product, the business outcomes that that product drives are more important than how it drives those outcomes. So you need to be talking to those outcomes and telling stories throughout your demo. So that looks like a demo flow that starts with the bad outcome. That's the status quo without your product. So that sounds like most people end up buying way more ChapStick than they actually ever use. Then you tell the story in that status quo and how that happens. So you buy a ChapStick, you use it for a week or two, falls out of your pocket, you buy a new one. Then next week, same thing happens, and you just keep buying ChapStick after ChapStick because you're losing them. Then you go into the product feature. This is the thing that changes the game, but the focus is still on the story. We make sure that you won't ever lose your ChapStick because we got a chain that hooks it to your pants. You don't talk about what the chain's made of. You talk about what it does. You don't lose it anymore. Then you tell a story when somebody has your product and how it's changed for them. Instead of losing the ChapStick forever, when it falls out of your pocket, it's still on the chain. You just grab it and put it right back in. Then you tell the good outcome. This is what happens when you use your product. Now you go from buying 20 ChapSticks a year to buying four because you never lost one. Well, now I know what I'm getting Arman for his birthday next year. What's number two? Number two is forget the screen. Now it's really easy when you're sharing the screen to get lost in the screen yourself and start describing all the product features and all the clicks. But that's a mistake. You gotta keep it anchored to your prospect's business outcomes. And if you do this well, your demo will be so consistent with their outcomes and so, unreliant on the screen itself that you can actually do it sitting on an airplane or on the bus next to somebody without your laptop. And what that looks like is instead of saying, if you click on this share button, you can select who the document is shared with to saying everybody on your team is gonna know exactly where every deal's at because you can share the document with them. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Round us out, Rob. What's number three? Number three is be a detective. Now a lot of buyers come in with a bunch of disjointed problems. They haven't had a ton of time to think about them or even how they play with each other. It's your job as the seller to uncover the entire narrative. What's causing those problems? Are they causing each other? If you solve one, does it solve the others? Is there a fifth problem that we didn't know about that's actually the source of all the other four? And so what that means is when you're doing discovery, don't treat it like a checklist where you go question to question to question. Build the entire narrative and repeat it back to them. Give them the opportunity to correct you. If you're talking about, a company that's running comp cycles and you learn that the last step is CFO approves budget, don't just ask what happens if they don't approve. Take them back through the story. So in September, you're running a performance cycle. In October, you start to build the budget for the compensation cycle based on those performance ratings. In November, you submit it to the CFO. What happens next? Where are we in the story? When I learn the next piece, you start right back over, and you tell the entire story start to finish. So we're gonna tell the entire demo start to finish. So, Rob, you get onto a demo. You do the classic, AE recaps the problems, yada yada yada, and now it's your time to shine. How do you set the stage for a demo? So when you set the stage for a demo, there are really two different things you can do. And this depends on what the prep has has been coming in and what stage we're at. In an earlier stage, we don't know a ton about this prospect yet, and there's gonna be a ton of discovery that we need to do. So the first thing you do is you say, you know, while I pull my screen up, and then you ask them a question. And you're gonna ask them a question that's gonna get to outcome and impact as quickly as possible. So at Pave, that meant anytime I was starting an early stage demo, saying, hey. By the way, while I pull this screen up real quick, are you looking at a tool to run comp cycles because people have been overspending? Like, are you over budget or what what's going on there? You get one free question every single time because they perceive it as you trying to kill dead air. The other kind of demo is later stage. That's where you know what all the outcomes are. That's when where you're presenting to leadership. This is the big pitch. As you're pulling it up, what you do is you reiterate the precise outcomes that you already know that they wanna drive. Again, this isn't, I'm about to take you through the product. This is, now what we've been talking about is how you're gonna run the most efficient cycles on the planet so that we stay under budget every single time. Then you get into the demo. So you ask your freebie question, and they're like, yeah. Our comp cycle's been running over. Yeah. It's been an operational pain. Oh my god. We're getting a little bit too big for these spreadsheets, and now it's time to kick off. Where do you actually decide to start in your demo? I'm curious, like, how you think about, like, the entry point into the story. The entry point's always gonna be based on what their problem is and what outcome they need to drive. I actually think about what most people think about is one demo is probably, like, 15 little demos in between. So it's on you to pick that right entry point. So if somebody tells me that people are making mistakes, then what we'll start with is, here's how we're gonna make sure that they don't make mistakes. And those are gonna be different features than if they tell me that they have a problem with budget planning. And those are gonna be different features than if they tell me they have a problem with a single source of truth. So let's do an example here. And I wanna go back to that initial framework that you gave on demoing the live. So pick any example feature starting point in a demo. Could you give us an example of what a crappy version would sound like and then what a better version would sound like when you're demoing something? As you know, one of the things at the top of the Pave compensation planner is your budget. So it tracks what's the denominator, how much do you have to spend. And then while you make decisions, it starts adding it up, and it tells you if you're over or under. The bad way to demo that is to say budgets are at the top. The denominator here is how much you've allocated. The numerator is how much the planner has spent. I'll show you. If you scroll down, I can enter a number. We're gonna take them over budget, and now the color of the bar is gonna go from green to red. That's the bad way. That's just describing the feature. The good way is to talk about planners. They generally wanna make good decisions. They don't wanna go over budget. When they go over budget, it's because they didn't know what the budget was, and they didn't know how much they were spending. So what we do is we make it obvious. We put it in their face. Have you gone over, or are you still good? That way, when planners are making decisions, they can actually do it keeping budget in mind. And then what you get is you get submissions that you don't have to chase down and fix. You get submissions that are actually aligned to the philosophy. A really common mistake people make is they are literally clicking and just narrating the clicks. And what Rob did in the second one is he's describing the story of when I'm trying to keep people on budget, here are the things that I normally can't do, and now here's how I'm gonna have peace of mind. And the prospect has two eyes, and they can look at the screen to see how the budget is turning from red to green, but they don't need you to say it turned from red to green. They need you to tell them what turning red to green means for them as a prospect. Right. One of the things that we've been focused on in our demos at 30 MPC is instead of saying what it is, saying what it means. And, actually, what you did, Rob, one of the things we've talked about a lot on 30 MPC is the concept of a problem proposition where you explain in excruciating detail the problem that the prospect has. And we normally do that in the perspective of when you're making a cold call and giving a pitch. You're actually doing something similar where my guess is for every single feature or screen that you're showing, you're thinking about the before state problems that you know that they are experiencing. And it actually sounds to me like you're you're showing two demos. There's two demos that happen simultaneously. There's what's happening on the screen, and you probably have the muscle memory built to you know exactly where to click for everything. And then there's what's coming out of your mouth. And I think too many salespeople, they make both of those things the same. So they just narrate what is on the screen. Could you give another example just to keep making this real for folks of, like, maybe another feature from when you were at Pave? Yeah. So at Pave, there's another product. It's called Total Rewards. It's an employee facing portal so that you can see how all the different pieces of your comp roll up together. Base salary, commission, any bonuses, your equity, your benefits, and the reason why people buy it. Mhmm. Isn't so that employees get an overview of their compensation and their benefits and their equity. The reason why they buy it is because they don't want people to leave. So the bad demo version of total rewards is describing. So the base salary comes from your HRIS, which is rippling. The equity data comes from your equity management system, which is Carta. If you click here on the slider, you can actually model what the equity could be worth if we two x or three x or four x. And down below, we have the benefits, which can be created either by reading directly from Rippling. Or if you have a perk like free lunch, you could just define it right here in the product. Mhmm. That's the bad version. The good version is a lot of times employees leave a company because they think that they're leaving for a better offer. Most of the time, they're not. But the reason why they're leaving because they thought they had a better offer was because they didn't fully understand their comp package. They were looking at a base salary number, maybe a commission number, and that was about it. And so what the Total Rewards platform does is it gives your employees the tools to understand exactly what their comp package looks like today. That means that when they get a competing offer, they can actually assess whether that competing offer is better or worse. And most of the time, it's worse. And where that lands you is employees that are far more likely to stay and far more likely to be happy about the fact that they've stayed. Rob, for you, this is a second nature. For a lot of folks listening to this, the concept of showing the click path and the stuff on the screen while also telling that narrative is super overwhelming. So I'm curious what are some things that folks who are showing demos can do to make things easier on themselves while telling that story and demoing? I'm thinking of stuff like having multiple tabs with preloaded screens, maybe having, like, a video of the product to show something really complex. What are some things that we can do to, like, ease that demo cognitive load so that I can focus on telling the story? Have your assets ready to go. Nobody needs to see you navigate the platform. It only confuses them and puts mental load on you. Have videos, have screenshots. It doesn't have to be live in product every single time. Because, again, what matters is the story. Another tip that I tell my teams frequently is just click less. It's actually not important that you demonstrate every single thing that you're talking about. I don't need to really move that slider. They see there's a slider. They know what it looks like when equity goes up. Just click less. Take your hands off the mouse and keyboard. One other thing that I've been doing, Rob, is there's times that, like, I have to demo on the fly. And so the demo that I show, everything lives in Google Chrome. There's a bunch of different web links that I'm showing. And what I did was I figured out the 24 different things that I'm showing during a demo, and I put them in a bookmarked folder. And so when it's time for me to show a demo, I literally right click on the folder, and I can open all 24 tabs in one click. And it happened today even where I had a meeting with a a CMO. I've been working with her team, and I met with her. And all of a sudden, she was like, wait. Can you actually take me through this really quick? And I didn't have everything ready because I didn't think I was showing a demo, but it was really, really easy for me to be able to be, like, give me one second. Right click, open all, and everything was loaded. And so those are some other things that have, like, made things easier for me. If you don't have something ready to go, let's say it's like the twenty fifth thing and you didn't anticipate it. A lot of folks use zoom. I love using zoom on demos specifically because it lets you pause the screen without the audience knowing you've paused the screen. So pause the screen, bring up the thing you need to show, then resume. Don't let them see that you're futzing with bookmarks. Don't let them see that you got a log on your Gmail. Else. I know. I know that stuff. It's not important. The last thing that I'll give you folks is at Pave, there were seven, eight, nine different entry points for a demo or hero features inside of the demo. You can practice one story for each of those. And literally every time I got to the equity slider portion of the Pave demo, it was 90 percent the same story every time, 10% slightly tailored to their situation. Yep. But it was the same before, the same after, and then you just tailor it to them. So on that note, how are you tailoring your demos to your prospect's situation? For example, how are you pulling in the information that you learned from your AE in discovery, or are you asking questions before you demo a feature? How are you making the demo real for them? So a lot of times, you go in with notes from your AE that they've already captured in discovery. When it's time to tell these stories, clarify that those notes were right. Don't ask the question again. Say, one of the issues you've been having is that employees don't actually understand that their equity's worth something. Right? Mhmm. Give them the opportunity to correct you, then you can launch into the story. 90% of it is templated. There are so many places for you to insert the things that you've learned. You practice saying it comes from the equity management system. They tell you that it's Carta. So you don't say equity management. You say Carta. They tell you a story about an employee named Nick who just quit. You don't say an employee gets to understand their total comp. You say that way Nick gets to understand their total comp. Some of the other things that you can do, this one is if you have a prospect who's not giving you very much as you're doing this discovery, you can actually say less and pull those details out from them. Don't actually tell the full story. As in, if we've got that five point thing, bad outcome, bad story, game changing feature, good story, good outcome, Just speak to the outcomes. They're gonna ask you for those middle details. But in order to ask you, they have to give you their story. Alright. So we've talked about a lot of the things that you are showing and the way that you're explaining the meaning behind what you're showing. Obviously, you don't show every element of your platform or whatever you sell during a demo. Are there certain things that you always omit or choose not to show during a demo? There are typically two areas here. Number one is setup. You don't need to show what it's like to get started for the first time. It only happens once. Number two is any, like, background configurations. Behind the scenes stuff. How do you manage users? How do you manage permissions? That stuff is both super boring. Mhmm. And it's also very standard across all SaaS platforms. Yeah. If you get questions in a demo about how you manage permissions, again, tell the story. Yeah. It's super important when you're working with comp that you don't give everybody in the company access to everybody's comp. We have permissions. They're really robust. They let you define who sees what. You don't need to show anything there. Just answer the question with the outcome that we drive. A pro tip that I have for everybody here is as you think about Rob, I really liked the language that you shared earlier about when you're showing a demo, it's not one demo. It's 15 mini demos because there's different features and elements and pieces of the demo that you're showing, and those 15 come together to tell the bigger, broader narrative. What really has helped me when I first started showing demos, and I still show our 30 MPC, both sponsorship and our Club Pass demos, is for each individual piece of what I'm showing on my own, I'm spending some time and I'm thinking, what are the three value points I want somebody to walk away from for this thing? So for the roles and permissions piece that you just shared, I need to think through what are the three things I need somebody to walk away knowing, And then I can really succinctly go boom, boom, boom, and move on versus a lot of folks get flustered and they end up sharing three paragraphs worth, and it's too much for the buyer. And it actually makes it seem more complex than it actually is when it's really quite simple. That's actually a really good framework. And how I tend to think about it is across those 15 mini demos, there's still three main things. Mhmm. Not three for each. Three in total that you need to make sure that your buyer walks away understanding. And so you need to hit those as often as possible, and you need to steer clear of anything else as much as you can. Roles and permissions, I can't think of a single product where that's in my top three. So, Rob, on the note of things you don't show, you also cannot show features that don't exist, unfortunately. And we sold in the early stages together. A lot of times, we would get a prospect who would jump onto the call. They would love the compensation planner, and they'd be like, hey. You got all this compensation data. You know, one of the things that's really important to us in a compensation planner is we wanna have robust compensation analytics or reporting. How do you handle that when you know it's a feature gap? When you get hit with a question that ultimately leads to a gap is one during discovery. You can't win it in that moment. And without good discovery, it's gonna be really, really tough to get out of there. But you should already understand the narrative. You should understand where the problems are. And then what you can do is you can ask them why. If you're asking me about analytics, what are you hoping to analyze there? And they'll tell you. And nine times out of 10, it's not something that's directly relevant to the problems that they're setting out to solve in your product. Mhmm. It might be a tangential problem, but what you'll uncover is that it's a different tools failing, not your own, that they're trying to solve. My HRIS is really, really bad at reporting what people's t shirt size is. That's an HRIS problem. We're thinking about comp here. What I'm hearing from you, there's this concept that we've talked about before, which is understand the question behind the question, which is oftentimes when somebody asks you a question, do you do x? Do you do y? You understand, well, what are they really asking there? What I'm sort of hearing from you is, like, a variant on that, which is, like, the intent behind the ask. When they ask for a feature, you're hoping to understand what do they want to do with that. And frankly, that applies whether or not you have that feature. This would happen all the time when we sold ERP software to law firms is folks would be like, well, do you have analytics dashboards? And the bad thing to do would be like, yeah. We do. Let me pull them up. You can look at attorney comp. You can look at different profitability by client, by matter. Boom. Boom. Boom. And they were like, oh, well, we were actually hoping to see this over here. And so before demoing anything, you have to understand why are they asking about that thing at all? Because that helps you more nuanced understand how do I show it? How do I not show it and explain why I'm not showing it? Or how do I tell them we don't have it at all? But that's actually a good thing. There are three routes you can take someone if you don't do the thing they want. Route number one is what Rob described, which is you can say, like, hey. Like, there's a different way to solve that problem. Where, for example, at Pave, people would be like, I wanna do all my reporting, and he would say, like, oh, you could go do all your reporting in your HRIS. Or this happens with sales tech a lot. Where, like, if I had a parallel dialer, like, sure, it would be nice to report on, I don't know, connect rates, dial volume, all that stuff inside of the parallel dialer. But if all that data is getting pushed back to the CRM, isn't it just better for me to report on that inside of my Salesforce dashboard with everything else? So that's the first place, is you push them to a different place, and you say that's not the right place to be doing this. The second is you make it clear that it's an intentional product decision to protect them. So, for example, many people don't know that it was a very intentional decision for Asana to only allow you to have one owner per task. And a lot of times, there's a reason that you don't want to let your prospects monkey around with the design of your product and do whatever they want because it ruins a lot of the fundamental principles of what makes good looking design or in Asana's case, what makes one person on the hook for a task. And then the final bucket is if you don't have it, then you can either say, hey. This isn't the vision of where our company is going, or you can say it's on the road map. But, usually, you can catch most people in buckets one or two. Well, Rob, the clock is tick tick ticking, and we gotta move to the final question. Final question is this. We've talked about a ton of great demo best practices. I'm gonna ask you about a worst practice. So the best question is, what's one bad habit that you see most salespeople or SEs demonstrate that you think you need to break when they're demoing because it hurts them more than it helps. Everything that they do when the demo is colored by this fear that they're gonna be exposed is not actually being the expert. That's what leads to oversharing. That's what leads to showing somebody every last click. The reality is the best demoers don't know everything about the product. The best demos can jump into a product, use it for ten minutes, and then deliver a really, really compelling demo. Steve Jobs didn't know how the iPhone worked. Yeah. Right? Like, he wasn't designing the chips. Mhmm. He was telling you what the iPhone was gonna do for you. You gotta think of yourself as that way. You don't have to have every single answer. Dude, phenomenal freaking episode. Thank you for joining us, Rob. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, folks. It is time for a two by two recap from this episode with Rob Friedland. What do you have for your two? So number one is when you're showing a demo, you should not be showing what it is and saying what it is. You should be showing what it is and saying what it means. Your talk track when showing the demo is different than narrating what is on the screen. Number two is stop thinking about your demo as one big demo and instead break out the 15 or 25 different screens or features or elements of what you're showing in that story. And then to prepare for your demos, you only need to do this really once. Think about the big three value points that you wanna communicate for each feature or screen, and this will help you tell a demo that hits with more resonance while also not overwhelming them with monologues that restate the same point again and again and again. Number three. The easiest way to have a demo snooze fest is you start with the permissions. If someone is asking, how do I make sure someone doesn't have access to all of our comp data? Don't show them the permissions. Show them the end outcome where the manager only sees this many employees versus the director sees that many employees. And then lastly, number four, Rob's demo framework was as follows. Bad outcome. People end up buying way more ChapStick than they actually use. Customer story. You buy a ChapStick, use it for a week or two, falls out of your pocket, you lose it with more than three quarters of the stick left. Happens all the time. Product feature, the ChapStick chain. Customer story, instead of losing the ChapStick forever, you pull up the chain, ChapStick back in the pocket. Good outcome, you can go from buying 20 Chapsticks a year to four. So before outcome, before story. Feature, after story, after outcome. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? We talk about best practices for nailing a demo, but if you don't set your big team demo up properly, you are dead in the water no matter how much you prepared for it. And there's a very, very specific way that you should be kicking off those big team demos, and you are in luck because thirty MPC put together what we call the big team demo deck and the big team demo guide, which will help you when you are demoing to stakeholders you've not yet met with who usually are those folks that are gonna scrutinize you the most. So there is a link in the show notes to go get that big team demo deck framework. Check it out. It will help you with your demos, and we'll see you next week on the show.
