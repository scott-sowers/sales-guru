## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this Playbook episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I am here live in studio with the one and only, Marc Kosiglott. And, folks, we are talking about a topic that is probably the single most passion that I have for any sales leadership topic in the world, and it is how to approach ongoing training for your sales team. So not onboarding where you do three weeks of uselessness and then throw them into the field, but how do you make sure that your reps get better every single week, every single month, and not overload them with information? Mark, why should people listen? I think if you don't prioritize how you increase the skill level of your team as a major tenant of your leadership philosophy, then you don't have it. But unfortunately, if you treat it like something that you offshore to your enablement person and don't really understand how it works and have a plan that you as a sales leader really, really endorse, I think you're always gonna find yourself lacking on the back end. And today, we're gonna talk about what is your sales enablement philosophy. And we're gonna do that in three parts. So part one is gonna focus on what can your team even take in terms of training? How do you assess where their skill level is? And how do you even know what they need training on? From there, we'll talk about upfront trainings. So once you've decided, hey. My team needs some help with this thing. How do you actually roll out the initial training? Mhmm. And then the way that we'll wrap is we'll focus on reinforcement, which is arguably going to be the most important part of this. Mhmm. How do you train your managers to make sure that your reps are constantly getting the coaching ongoing every single week so that when you run the upfront training, this stuff actually sticks. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. So, Mark, let's start at the beginning. Figuring out what can you even train on in the first place. You have this thing that you call the rep assessment matrix Mhmm. That you use to understand your rep's capability level, but then also how much new information they can take. Could you walk me through how that works? As a sales leader, there's two things that you need to be aware of when it comes to skill building, training, enablement, whatever you wanna call it. The first is how much can a rep take before you give them too much? Always tell my enablement person, listen, we can keep shoving stuff down somebody's throat, but eventually they can't chew it all and digest it. And so we wanna do trainings that people can digest, learn from, get the nutrients out of, and and be healthier sellers because of the second part of what we need to worry about with, enablement is how good do we want somebody to get? I want my CEO to show up to a call and I want them to be blown away about how great we are with the, execution on this talk track, then that's a very different beast. So you have to take that into account. So what I did is I created a a grid, a framework. On the x axis is capability, and capability speaks to how good is someone at what we're asking them to do. If they are aware, that means they attended the training. If they're competent, what that means is they have role played with someone internally. There's been an internal rubric, and they have shown that their ability to do the training. And then if their mastery, they've now sent me a Gong call with a customer in the wild, and I use that same rubric. And I'm like, okay. Yeah. They actually did it for real in real life with a real buyer. And we've now been able to say they're really, really good at this. Great. So now I understand capability, low, medium, high. On the y axis, you have cognitive load. Yep. And this is how hard or how taxing is it to learn this concept, and you also have low, medium, high. Could you give an example of what low cognitive load, medium cognitive load, and high cognitive load trainings would look like? How deeply rooted is the behavior in the mind of the person? How much mental effort is it gonna take for them to make a behavioral change? What low means is, like, you know what? It doesn't require that much effort. Like, for example, let's say that you change your order form in a way where, like, there's a button on the left instead of on the right, and they have to fill out one more field. That doesn't take a lot of mental energy to figure out, oh, yeah. Next time I do this, I need to make sure that I'd click on the right button and fill out this field. Medium load is like, hey. You know what? Like, I might need to practice this a couple of times. I might need I need to, like, wrap my head around it, but I can get it. High cognitive load means is I'm ripping out a deeply rooted thing, and I'm replacing it with something else that I want to be as equally deeply rooted when I'm done. And that's going to be something like a discovery call, a negotiations call, how you demo, you know, how you run your one on one if you're a manager. I would say the way to think about cognitive load is the more critical it is to the success. Usually the higher the cognitive load it is for the rep to be able to, like, displace what they currently know and replace it with what they're you're trying to teach them in the training. Yeah. And this grid does a great job of helping you understand how much reinforcement do we need to do if it's low cognitive load and you just want somebody to be aware, that's when you might not do anything afterwards, you might send an email two weeks afterwards, be like, Hey guys, don't forget about this. But But if you're trying to get to mastery on something that's changing a fundamental behavior of how your salespeople are acting right now, you better have a twelve to thirteen week quarter long program to rip the thing out, replace it, get it rooted, water it, let it grow, get the roots set. So that that way, like, that thing is actually how people do stuff at the end of that. All right. Let's move forward. Let's actually jump to the training itself. So let's assume that I've identified one or two big themes for the month, for the quarter, whatever it might be, and I now want to run an initial upfront training. What is the forum for that training in the first place? Are you doing this across your entire organization? Are you oftentimes running these trainings at team level? Are you running them at the pod level one on one? How do you actually roll out this first training? Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of it depends on your org size. In in the very beginning at outreach until maybe 20 or 25 reps, almost everything that we did was as a group. And so we would get everybody on a Friday training or, you know, whatever version of that we were doing or some special launch. And we would just do everybody all at once. As you get bigger, though, you need to disseminate that training down. The training has to stay close to the reps when the training starts to get far away from the reps like Mark, who is SVP of global sales, who's like four levels above you is like doing a training for everybody. It's just not as as effective as if your VP, who you have a weekly team meeting with, is doing it every day. So the size of your org depends on how far away you want the training to be from the rep. I like to keep it close. And so I might do one or two trainings a quarter as an entire team around very specific things, but they would always then be supported at the VP level inside their team trainings. And then anything else that they decided they wanted to do after we picked the big org wide stuff, they would do at their team level inside their own team meetings. And I'll be honest with you, Armand. This was tough for me. I'm a very big everybody's learning the same thing at the same time. And letting go a little bit and let okay. Chris Albro, who runs strategic, needs to train on this with his team this quarter. David Rubinstein, who talks about this stuff, needs to do this stuff for his team on the East Coast in mid market this quarter. Different things. I understand why, but, like, it felt weird to me that they ever the whole team wasn't learning all the same stuff at the same time. But Yeah. But keeping that training close to the reps is always super important. 100%. At Pave, it was something similar where I was running two and a half teams as a VP of sales. So it's two managers running commercial and mid market, and then I oversaw two or three enterprise reps. Mhmm. And that's a small enough team where I can run that entire training with a group of 20 reps and still, like, wrap my hands around the room, or I can ask a manager who's better at that concept to run the training. And so we would usually roll out the initial concepts altogether. Mhmm. But then when it came to the reinforcement rhythms, those would happen in the manager's pods. So, for example, if we were rolling out a new framework to ask discovery questions, we would do that at the team level, at the org level. But then the managers would go and do the tape reviews at the manager level in a small group of eight so they can really cater to their reps' needs, but also start to infuse their own unique style based on what their reps need on their given team. Let's talk about who's running the training because this brings up the role of sales enablement versus the super CRO who runs all the trainings versus the super rep who runs the trainings. Who should be responsible for what when it comes to running trainings? In my experience, there's a couple kinds of enablement people. There are training enablement people that are excellent teachers. They're engaging. They have just enough street cred for people to listen. They're entertaining. They hold people's attention. It's okay for that type of a professional trainer to run enablement. But if you have a more traditional enablement person is good at putting together the program and helping you figure out the framework and putting together the materials, they don't have that street cred in front of your team. Don't ever make the mistake of putting that person in front of your team. It delegitimizes the rest of their work when they're not in front of the team showing strong as a like a real trainer would. My favorite thing to do was for if it was kind of a everyday sort of thing was to have a rep come in. And usually what would happen is, is you always have to train your managers first. If you don't take the time to help your managers understand what's coming down the pipe so they can get their heads around it so that they can support the training later. You've messed up. If your managers and your salespeople kind of get trained at the same time, you've messed up because now you have blind leading the blind. So you have to really make sure that you're, training the trainers, not just training the people that are needing the skill. My favorite thing to do is to have that manager that really showed really well or a rep that we brought in do trainings. I think just salespeople in general really respond much better to appear doing a training versus an enablement person or something like that. The way that I think about it is really similar, which is who's the best person in the world by how much to run this training? How big of a difference is there if my number one rep is running a discovery training versus enablement is running a discovery training? Massive. Yeah. Huge difference. How big of a difference is there if my enablement person is running a stock options one zero one training versus the number one rep on my team is running stock options one zero one. Yeah. Not that much of a difference. It's like basic definitions and industry knowledge and stuff like that. So I find that enablement can teach pretty darn well with industry stuff. They can teach okay with product stuff. They can teach pretty poorly with sales stuff. Mhmm. Again, unless you get an enablement person who's a total ace who has sales experience. And I know this probably hurts for some enablement people to hear, but this doesn't mean that your job isn't valuable. What it means is your job is not the actor on the set. You're sitting in the director chair. Mhmm. So Mark talked about you need to train the managers first. You also need to make sure that the stuff gets tracked inside of systems. You also may need to make sure that you're training on the right things. You are the right hand adviser to the VP of sales who's trying to understand what they should even train their team on. And then the VP of sales knows I need to train my managers, but can you make sure that we have a rhythm in place? Can you help them build the decks? If you have a super rep who's vomiting information at you, can you help them structure that information? You're the director and the producer that's making sure that everyone gets on set, but then let the actors be the one who are actually delivering the script. No doubt. And listen, we've talked a lot about street cred in this podcast. If you, as an executive, aren't willing to model the training or do the role play, you have have to be a part of the training. If you're a CRO or VP of sales, you can't just be on the training with your camera off while you're doing Slack, showing everybody else that you're not paying attention because you don't care enough. Because guess what? That that translates to them. They don't care enough versus if you're on the training, you're typing in the comments, this is fire. Oh my god. This is dough. Did you just see how Alex Cook crushed that little role play? Let me in, coach. Let me do my role play. If you get that to that point, I'm telling you, your reps will be on fire. You've put in front of them that you care enough, that you learned it ahead of time to show them how to do it, to get over your own, insecurities, to do something new in front of the group. I'm telling you, that's the kind of stuff that makes a magical sales team. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. You can do all of this stuff right. You can know exactly what to train on. You can train the managers first. You can have sales enablement build all these nice decks. But if your training itself sucks, nothing's gonna happen. So this is literally a clinic on how we do content at thirty minutes to president's club. It's very similar to how you run a training. So I'm gonna, like, pull up in the veil. When we are prepping podcast guests, this is literally how we prep them for an episode like this to make sure that it's actionable, which is the number one biggest criminal mistake that sales managers or leaders make is they run these academic theoretical trainings that reps don't actually understand. Mhmm. So step number one, whatever topic you are picking, break it down into three steps. So for example, cold calls, you have your opener, your problem prop, or your value prop, and then you have objections. Discovery call, you have your agenda. You have your discovery questions. You have your next steps. Within those, you can also break those down into three steps. So for example, discovery questions, you could say, hey. We're gonna start with the situational questions, then we're gonna talk about the problem questions and the impact questions. Or within your opener, we can talk about the initial pattern break, the ask for interruption, and the arms up at the end of it, whatever it might be. So one, break it down into threes in chronological order so there's a very clear outline for your reps. Number two, within each of those sections, way too many people focus on why to do something Mhmm. Or what to do, but they don't spend enough time on how to do it. Let's say I'm teaching discovery. A lot of people will focus 50% of the training saying things like, you gotta get to real business problems. You gotta ask the hard questions. If you don't find a problem, you're not gonna close the deal. That is all why discovery is important Mhmm. And high level what you can do. But the rep has no idea what the hard questions are and when they should ask them. So there are two levels of how. And I would recommend, again, to the twenty eighty principle. Spend 20% of your time on the why and the what to do. Spend 80% of your time on the how. The first level of how is steps. With steps, I might say, the first thing you're gonna do is you wanna start with high level situational questions, and those situational questions might sound like this is and this. Then you wanna turn those situations into problems. Then you wanna turn those problems into bottom line impact. The second level of how is not how steps. It's how does it sound. Now you're going into voice over scripts, talk tracks, and all of that stuff. And so what I would challenge everyone to do is if you look at every single one of your training slides, ask yourself, would my rep literally know what to say in what order? And if the answer is no, that means your training is not tactical enough. I mean, I coach my girls all the way up through junior high basketball. I coach hundreds and hundreds of travel basketball games and everything of that. And I learned one thing is if I did it in practice one time, I could guarantee it was never going to happen in the game. If I did it for half the season, ten minutes every single practice, maybe by the end, they pick it up. But then next year, it was to be something that we could use and actually work with. Right. So you got to make sure that your team is practicing without practice. There is no real settling in or rooting in of the skill. Mark, you talked about this example of you were completely changing your forecasting methodology. After you taught the initial training on the forecasting framework, how did you go about reinforcing that training with your team? So if you really believe that managers are the key to training because they're the ones that are watching for it every day, they're the ones that reinforce it in the moment and do those sorts of things which are so critical. You have to understand that when you ask a rep to change, a manager must also change. So if I'm asking a rep to change how they enter data into Salesforce, how they think about forecasting, then my managers have to think about how am I going to change my one on one or my deal review in order to help make that change possible and to show that it's also affected me as your manager. It's not just something that we're asking you to do as a rep. What we did, at Outreach is we completely changed up how we did forecasting. What I did is I actually, before we released it to the reps, we created a two pager of what we call our deal review meeting. And in that deal review meeting, I outlined, this is the agenda. This is how you do it. This is what this meeting is not. This is the point of this meeting. These are the pitfalls of this meeting and why it will fail. Here's a series of questions that you ask about every single deal, every single time, every single week based on the answers. This is how you do it. After we did the forecast training, we gave the reps a one pager of this is what to expect in your deal review meeting. Now, listen, was this a training about deal reviews? No. This was a training about forecasting that we completely changed our deal review meeting and our management methodology of deal reviews in order to make sure the forecasting methodology was successful. If I go into a typical company, I find if I ask five reps what your forecast categories mean, every single one of them has a different definition, which means you're not really forecasting. And that's why you have the stupid spreadsheet that you pass around and your manager takes a haircut off your reps and your director takes a haircut off your managers and your VP takes a director or what, and then you go all the way up because nobody trusts anything because everybody really knows deep down the data inside of Salesforce doesn't mean anything. This is how you stop that kind of stuff. So you mentioned something in the prep that I wanna dig in on. Step one, you were training your team on the new way to do forecasting and deal reviews. Step two, documentation. Mhmm. A two pager for managers, a one pager for reps. Mhmm. And then I think you were saying that you would literally watch the managers deal reviews. Yes. So, every quarter, a manager was required to send me two recordings of them doing a deal review session with the reps, and I would watch every single one of those. And I had a coaching sheet and I would fill off the coaching seat and send it back. I wanted to make sure my managers were running that in a way that was using the forecasting training correct using when we did some new, stage based deal management stuff. We were doing that correctly when we started to think about, like, how do we estimate deals differently? Were they doing that correctly? So we created this forum that allowed us to make sure that the managers were driving the behavior. But then I coached the managers on what they were doing to make sure they were driving the behavior. We've got the training, the documentation, and then we have the rhythms at the manager and the rep level. That last piece, the rhythms, is the managers are doing the deal reviews with the reps, and then Mark is doing the deal reviews on the deal reviews. Mhmm. This is one mistake people make when they go from first line manager to second line leader. They were previously running the tape reviews with their team, and then they take a step back and they just assume the manager can do the same thing. You you can't. You have to do one and a half jobs Mhmm. Until you fully step back. And so I would literally be doing tape reviews on the tape reviews. Yeah. So I would be watching the tape review with the manager, and then I would say, hey. This is one question that you should have asked your reps instead of just giving them the answer yourselves. Yeah. So you need to coach the coaches and make sure the coaches coach the reps. Mark talked for, like, two seconds about the training that he did on the deal review. You are spending 80% of your time reinforcing those deal reviews with the reps and the managers. If you don't assume that your training will die within twenty four hours of you doing it, if you don't assume that in any training, then you are making an incorrect assumption. And if you assume that and it's true, then you must do something to help with knowledge retainment. And that is the 80% of your rule where you've got to spend 80% of your effort getting people to retain what you've given them. We've talked about trying to roll this into existing rhythms when you wanted to change your deal review process or your forecasting process, it's not like you rescheduled all of your deal reviews. The deal reviews were already happening. You just infused different concepts into existing rhythms. When it comes to cognitive load, one way you can overload your sales team is if you're trying to teach them new concepts and then you're throwing a million new meetings on the calendar Mhmm. You've got a problem. Every single week, regardless of what you're training, I always had three reinforcement rhythms. Number one, we always had a Monday morning meeting where we had a five minute squeeze where we would break down, number one, what were your prospecting metrics, but then we would review a cold call or a cold email. And so that Monday morning meeting was getting people better at prospecting every single week. And if we were focused on objection handling for the quarter, we would just focus on call reviews in the Monday morning meeting focused on objections. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays and Thursdays privately with the managers, we would do deal reviews. So I would do a top 10 deal review with the entire team for our biggest deals, but then the managers would go and do one on one deal and pipeline reviews with their reps on Wednesdays and Thursdays. And that's where process gets reinforced. And then on Fridays during lunch, we would always do tape reviews, and that was focused on discovery. So you had a little bit of prospecting at the beginning, a little bit of process in the middle, a little bit of discovery at the end of the week when people are, like, happy going in the weekend. You can slow down and focus on, like, more the philosophy of how to ask good questions. And then once per month, we would just replace one tape review with one new training. And when you put your team into these rhythms, they start to get addicted to them. It creates this predictability for your reps where they're not thinking about, where am I gonna learn this thing? How am I gonna reinforce it, all this stuff? If you teach them a new concept, they naturally know, okay. This is just gonna come up in my practice every single week inside of my deal reviews, and it's not adding a new meeting and new cognitive load to my plate. Sometimes when you take an established rhythm and you inject a part of it that is reserved for we're going to highlight what is important right now, even though that might be a little bit out of rhythm. I ask people when I do webinars all the time, hey, what's more important, education or entertainment? If they say to me on a webinar education, I'm probably not gonna do the webinar. And you have to think about training the same way. There's a knowledge transfer and a knowledge component, but you better also be entertaining. How do you know that your training actually worked? I think the way that you know something works or not is first is you need to decide, is it qualitative or is it quantitative? Is it behavioral or is it metric driven? If it's metric driven, you better look at the metrics and figure out what you need to do. If you make a lagging metric, your metric of success for training, you have done things the wrong way. You want to do the leading metric. Is this actually thing happening early on? And so you can catch it early. If you measure lagging for training stuff, you will not know that your training hasn't worked for too long to then go back and fix it. You gotta be on a leading metric. If it's qualitative, what I'm looking for is like feedback from managers, reps, customers that what they're doing feels better. It feels right. If you're teaching something that's not necessarily metric driven, then you can't have metrics decide if it's good or not. And so you have to rely a little bit more on the qualitative feedback for qualitative training. The recap from top to bottom, what can you even train on? So when you're thinking about running a training, you want to assess what is the capability level you wanna get your reps to. What is the cognitive load of the training? Low, medium, or high. Am I gonna train on one or two big things in the quarter, or am I gonna train four or five medium or smaller sized things? You want the best person for the job to be running that training, and sales enablement is often playing the role of the director. It is money if you can get the most respected rep or manager on the floor to run the training on your behalf. And then it's critical, especially as you get to bigger sized orgs, train your managers before you train the reps. Then when it comes to reinforcing those trainings, try to establish existing weekly rhythms for your team, and then drop the reinforcement rhythms into one of those existing rhythms so you're not adding new meetings. In the example that Mark went through, he ran the training. He trained the managers. He He trained the reps. He gave documentation for the managers and the reps, and then included weekly deal reviews using that new forecasting methodology. And then he was doing tape reviews on the managers' deal reviews. And then the last thing that we just talked about is do not try to quantify the things that cannot be quantified. When I was at Pave, this is exactly how we would train people, is we would train them once per month. Every single week, we would hammer it into their heads with tape reviews, cold call reviews, cold email reviews. And then from there, they were surrounded by a community of other reps on the floor who were all doing the exact same thing, who held them accountable so they had no choice but to actually get this thing done. So we are launching what we are calling the thirty minutes to president's club club pass, which is a program that includes upfront training and courses, weekly coaching sessions with Nick, myself, and club coaches, and then an entire community where you can connect with other thirty minutes to presidents club listeners who will hold you accountable, and you can even enroll in fun things like the $200 challenge. And so if you like what you heard here, we are literally rolling out these programs that we talked about in this session to the entire world, and you can go check that out at 30mpc.combackslashclub pass, all one word. That link is in the show notes. We'll catch you on the next one.
