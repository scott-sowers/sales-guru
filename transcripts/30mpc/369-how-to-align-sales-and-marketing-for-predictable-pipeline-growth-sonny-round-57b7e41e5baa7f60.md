## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my co host, Mark Cosgrove. And today, we have the one and only for round two, Sonny Round. He is the director of global sales development over at Panopto. He has exceeded pipeline generation quota targets for the past 16 in a row, four years in a row, and he's pushed pipeline generation efforts to unicorn valuations two times at past companies. Mark, why should people listen? You just said why somebody the proof is in the pudding, y'all. We get a really interesting dynamic between what is the relationship between sales and marketing. And Sunny drops a couple metrics that I've never heard of anybody measuring that immediately I was like, adding it to my bag. Boom. And a three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, Sonny. Welcome back to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Hey. It's great to be back. First takeaway, monthly build the pipe meeting. Right? So the monthly build the pipe meeting is a great way to effectively tie your funnel together for demand gen. And what I mean by that is connecting the marketing team with the sales team and making sure that we're optimizing the process of bringing new leads into the pipeline and also making sure that we're qualifying and handing them off to AEs in a really effective way. And sometimes, I think that there's a healthy amount of headbutting between sales and marketing, but sometimes what I've seen is that headbutting doesn't always resolve in working together to optimize and fix both sides of the funnel because no funnel is perfect on both sides or or anywhere in general. And the more you work together with your sales and marketing team, the the better your funnel is gonna become. So what we do in that build the pipe meeting is we standardize the data. What are the things that you're going to look at consistently? Right? How are you going to collect your data at the MQL level? And that could be what what are your lead sources? What are the things you care about, do you care about speed to lead, other metrics in your Salesforce that that you're optimizing for. And the next thing is review that data with a a very fine comb and make sure that you're consistent in reviewing the same data. So the four slides for that meeting could be, here are the leads by each key source this month. Right? Here are the conversions by each key source this month. How many of those leads did we end up getting to turn into a qualified meeting? The third slide could be how many of those qualified meetings turned into actual qualified opportunities by lead source again. And then that fourth slide could be the total pipeline amount that was built for the month and by lead source. And the key there is benchmarking that data before you start that meeting so that you can say, here's what we're doing today, and here's what we wanna do tomorrow, and here are the levers that we wanna pull to improve each one of those conversions. Right? I love those same four slides every time. What's number two? Number two is to build pipeline with the eighty twenty rule. Right? Honestly, the best ideas, they come from trying out new ideas that haven't been done before. The thing about trying new ideas is that sometimes they fall flat. What I always tell our team and our reps is follow the eighty twenty rule. 80% of what we do is gonna be things that we know and are proven to work. Right? The high priority inbound lead sources, outbounding into recycled leads or into closed lost deals. Those are tried and true methodologies, the the standard ICPs that we reach out to, all that good stuff. The 20% is trying new channels and testing new creative messaging ideas that maybe we haven't done so much in the past. So that 20% could be, hey. Looks like LinkedIn has this new ability to record videos if you're sending messages on your phone. I'm gonna try to send five messages a day for a week. And at the end of that week, I'm gonna go back and look and see, hey. Did these have a higher chance of of replying than when I just sent a a message that was strictly text based? Right? Let your reps be their own creators. I think sometimes, managers, can some understandably want to to standardize every single process, but the truth is some things are better left to to be uncaged, if you will. And so let people be creative. People wanna try new things. People wanna be creative. But at the same time, do it within a framework that that works and and can remain productive by following that eighty twenty rule. Today's show is brought to you by Nook. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alrighty. Bring us home. What's number three? So number three is turn your whole company into salespeople with creative campaigns. I'm sure everybody has heard the saying that referrals grow on trees. They're called referral trees. Some something or other like that. But one of the things that that we did at Panopto is we actually recently launched an and water outreach program. And Panopto is actually a video content management tool used by most universities and colleges worldwide. And one of the things that we realized is, hey. A lot of people that work at Panopto went to college. A lot of folks went on to get master's degrees and post grad degrees, and not all of those schools are Panopto customers today. So what we did is we took a a database of our employees working with our HR team, and and we went and enriched it to see where everybody went to school, whether it be undergrad or postgrad. And then we compared it against our database to see which one of these are customers and which ones are not. From there, we took the ones that weren't customers, and we said, here's a templated approach if you want to reach out to your alma mater and help evangelize Panopto and turn them into a customer. We also created a a pretty fun spiff gamification program around that. It wasn't like we were asking people to to do this for free. Salespeople are are coin operated, and and we would expect no different if we were asking folks from other teams to sell. And the results were really positive. It helped connect organization to the sales org and understand a day in the life of what it's like to sell. We were able to build over $500,000 in pipeline, and we had a dedicated Slack for folks that got responses but weren't quite sure how to reply to to work with the sales team to build an objection handling response. So at the end of the day, it's been a a really successful campaign. It's actually gonna be something that we evergreen and put into our onboarding process just to help people understand the motions and and who the key personas are and really what the value of the tool is. And luckily enough, I was able to reach out to my own alma mater, shout out Lafayette College, who were unfortunately using a competitor and have switched since over to Panopto. So we've got them now. They're in good hands and go Leopards. Listen. I that last one is pretty interesting, but I do wanna dig into the one that I think is probably most applicable to everybody and one that I found at Outreach and at Catalyst to be a huge driver of revenue and alignment, which is this sales and marketing alignment meeting. Now, Sonny, you said you get everybody in a room, you look at the same things and people don't point fingers, but we all know what happens when stuff gets tough. And when a number or two is bad, most people point fingers. Go through, explain to me, how do you keep people from pointing fingers? Yeah. That's a great question. And I think it is a fine line between pointing fingers and and holding each other accountable. Mhmm. And I think sometimes you almost have to tow the line in order to have a a really meaningful conversation. But in my opinion, the the most important thing is to standardize and agree on the data and how you're collecting the data, formatting the data, and reviewing that data so that there's no funny business around, well, that one didn't really count because it wasn't actually qualified. No. We agree what a marketing qualified lead is. This meets those terms, and that number was met. From there, you could say, our SDRs, what happened what happened this month? Why did we convert 3% lower than we're used to converting on this lead source? And that's where I think it's most helpful to actually talk to the reps, talk to the team, say, a lot of these leads that join this webinar were lower level leads than usually we get at a webinar. Right? Maybe there was a lot of analysts in that particular webinar. And so it's not that we're not having meaningful conversations. They're just not converting to meetings and qualified opportunities just yet. But, hey, we're learning a lot about these accounts. We're doing a lot of really impactful discovery. We're we're finding our way up the food chain to to get to the the meaningful buyers and and decision makers in the org. It's just not as instant a conversion as maybe some of the past month's webinars were. So we can dig a layer deeper into that data. I think when so we had something similar to Outreach and a catalyst. It was a weekly meeting. And it's funny. In the beginning, the executives wanted to come into this meeting, and then when we realized that's watch it letting them watch us make the sausage. Right? We we're gonna deliver a sausage, and I'll let them watch us make it. They don't wanna see what all goes into this. They don't understand half of it anyway. We moved them out, but it was me, my VP of, sales dev, and my senior director of demand gen who owned all the demand gen stuff. And it's funny. I would see if you'd see if you'd agree with this. We had two kinda rules. Rule one was your first point. Same data, always delivered by a third party, no interpretation, just the raw data, and you need to react to it. Right? And the second was any problem in this meeting is all of our problem. And so if demand gen is hurting, that's my problem, and that's SDR's problem. Just like the AE prospecting was hurting, it was demand gen problem and AE and SDR problem. And what that did is it created this awesome collaborative okay. I know it's demand gen, but it's my problem too. What is my part of that fix? And when you start to get that, like, is it it really creates this camaraderie. Steve and Harmony, those are my two partners in crime. Like, we are tight as thieves all the time, just, like, fixing stuff, and we never showed up to a board meeting or an executive meeting, and we're split or divided. It was one front all the freaking time. It made a huge difference. I'm wondering if you had something similar like that where you're at. Yeah. 1100%. I think that's definitely super important to be aligned. And and one of the things we say is if you're gonna highlight a problem in this data well, first of all, the the data should be sent out the day before. Right? So the people the the stakeholders can review that and and really go into that meeting without feeling blindsided. Definitely fully agree. Third party provided data. That's the importance and the criticality of of the revenue operations team. And then one of the things we always say is you're gonna point out a problem, try to be part of the solution. Right? So if if there's an issue at a certain point in the conversion of the funnel, hey. Maybe if we tried doing this to increase those conversions, maybe we could send a $5 copy so that more people are compelled to take that next meeting and convert into a really qualified opportunity. That might help. And and the other thing that I would say to 100% agree with your point on alignment is the comp plans for our leaders of sales and marketing and operations are a portion of all of those comp plans and bonus plans are tied to the company revenue metrics. So it's not like marketing only cares about getting theirs with MQLs or SDRs teams only care about getting a number of meetings or asking AEs to flip a bunch of stuff that maybe wasn't qualified. Every single person, including our SDRs, are tied to revenue, And and that's a a really powerful way to create alignment that that matters, works, and and ultimately creates the the goal, that everyone should be aligned to, which is generating revenue and and generating new business, for that go to market org. How does that work? Could you break it down for marketing and SDR, how they're incentivized on revenue? Yeah. So for marketing, it's like an ELT comp plan. Right? So, like, an executive comp plan where marketing bonuses, from my understanding, they're typically not as, volume driven where it's like, hey. If you get a thousand MQLs, you're gonna make x amount of money. It's usually somewhere in the range of a 15 to 20% bonus if they hit certain goals and objectives. And for the sales and sales development side, which I can definitely speak to, a little bit more intricately is that we have 80% of our bonus tied to sales qualified opportunities, and then we have 20% tied to the regional new business revenue goal of that region. So on one hand, it can be frustrating because as an SDR, you might say, I'm not closing the deals. It's totally out of my hands. But on the other hand, it's like, you're a huge part of closing those deals. The qualification that you're doing and and all the work you're doing to get this opportunity up and running matters a lot. And and the more you take a vested interest in really driving this forward the best way possible, to align to it closing as revenue, the the better off we're gonna be as an org. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. I'd say right now, Sonny, that most companies are really struggling at the very top of the funnel, like trying to get pipeline coverage. So why don't we go through some of the specific metrics pre AE that you guys track all the way through, then I'll share what we tracked at Outreach and Catalyst. As far as, like, how we look at the inbound metrics for an SDR specifically, we're looking at a couple of key things. Right? So we're looking at MQL to reply. How many of the MQLs that you got did you end up generating a reply from? Just reply on that one. And reply rate's awesome. We love replies. We we love to have a, a standardized benchmark of of reply rate because we can look at that and say, hey. Do our sequences need some work? Or are we not hitting home with the way that we're templating and and creating the the customization? Is a rep maybe not making their calls, or are we looking into that? Are they dialing at strange times that maybe might not be aligned to the prospects? There's a few levers in there that are definitely important. But after reply rate, I think what what what we go to next is what I think is the most important metric, which is reply to meeting conversion. So it's like you got a 100 MQLs. You had a reply rate of 20%. You got 20 replies. A really good rep might get 10 meetings from those 20 replies. So that's a reply to meeting rate of 50%. A rep who's maybe struggling and has some things that that we can work on would maybe get two or three meetings from those 20 replies. So they they've got closer to 10 or 15% meeting to rep reply to meeting rate. And when you see a low reply to meeting rate, like, there's a couple things that that jump out. And and one of those things is, are we putting the right leads in the top of the funnel? That's definitely more relevant to to outbound because, hopefully, your inbound leads are are coming in in a way where you're working with marketing to to give them feedback and say, hey. Here are the key titles. Here's the account minimums that we wanna score leads by, and and here's the engagement that we feel like is ready to come over the fence as an MQL. But the the bigger and more important lever there is objection handling. Right? All these replies you're getting, I doubt 18 of those 20 replies were nos. And it goes back to the the book that that Arman recently came out with, Cold Calling Sucks, where it's the the mister Miyagi effect. Right? When you when you get an objection, are you taking it in stride? Are you acknowledging it and saying, hey. I actually expected you to say that. Right? Or I figured you had something in place right now. And then shifting it into a next step that's a little bit more palatable, a little bit more digestible. How about we just have an educational conversation around some of the trends that we're seeing in the space, in the edtech space, and also to show you some of our newly released products just so that in the future when you're ready to make a decision, what's out there? How does that sound? Take something like that, for example, and say, okay. Maybe we can take the two meetings that rep's getting and turn those into closer to seven to 10 meetings. And that's a world of difference right there. Those are some super interesting metrics that I don't think many orbs are tracking. I'm gonna share mine. I don't know if there's as interesting as yours, but I always start with outbound with active opportunities, like our active outbound accounts, AOAs. How many accounts are we actively outbounding to? And that means that they have a manual step done within the last ten days. Right? I wanna know, do we have a a good volume at the top? Then what we do is we say, alright. What's the conversion rate then to a book meeting, then a held meeting, and then a held meeting to, qualified pipeline? Those were the things that I I went through every single week. And you gotta remember, there's two metrics. There's volume and conversion. Volume is the stopping point. How many active outbound accounts? How many meetings booked? How many meetings held? How many qualified opportunities? And you need to look at that on number and on dollars. If you just look at number, what happens is you can have really good conversion rates, but you're not converting the highest value opportunities and you're losing dollars. If you just look at dollars, you could be losing a lot of the long tail smaller s and b accounts, but your conversion rates look really good. You gotta be really careful. And so I divide the the funnel. Half is the number, half is the dollars, and then I look at each station along the way, which that implies, though, that you then need to have a size of prize. Like, how big is this account that I'm going after? What is the total amount of revenue that I think could be there, which is something your rev ops team can help you with? But looking at those two conversions through immediately, usually and I'm I'm studying. I'd I'd be interested if you see this too. But even the the most junior manager, when you put that number in front of them week after week, month after month, and they see it the same format, and it's not, like, rehearsed or or messed with. It's it's raw. These are the numbers. They start they can see the problem. That's the that's what you want. You wanna see the problem. Right? And then you have to decide, is what I'm looking at a blip? For example, if my book meetings are down this week, guess what? Salesforce our Dreamforce was last week, so nobody was around to book a meeting with. That makes sense. It's a blip. We don't do anything with a blip. We just see it through. Or is it a problem? And if it's a problem, it needs a program. And a program is something we put in place to affect a single metric that we're measuring the impact of. And that that's what I found. If you do that top of funnel, you can catch stuff and get it fixed unless it's, like, some kind of market wide collapse or something that everybody's struggling with. So I have questions for both of you guys on running this meeting, and then I wanna talk about some of the actual top funnel plays you could run if you're an SDR leader, manager, whatever it is. I've seen these meetings go really well where they're collaborative. I've seen them go really poorly where person sees SDR meetings are down. They look at it. They're like, oh, that's not good. But they don't actually know why. Because if SDR meetings are down, for example, or even if volume is down or if conversion is down, you might not have the second or third level data in your back pocket to be able to give the room an accurate reason why it's happening. And so you might not be able to actually recommend a suggested program. And for these meetings, are you guys sending out, like, a preread, and is each department responsible for coming with their point of view on why numbers are down? Or is this just meant to be, look. You show up, and we sort of work through the problem live together? I think it's important to send out the deck a day before the meeting so that people can read it and review it before going into the meeting. I don't necessarily think that there needs to be an additional meeting before the meeting to to align on on where people are at because I think that's what the meeting's for. And and a key to to having an effective conversation there is trying to avoid going into defense mode, which is really hard as a leader to do when one of, you know, the metrics that you own is down, trying to not immediately defend and say, the leads were bad that week or this, that, or the other. And it's no. Be vulnerable. Look at what your team is doing and what you can control and say, hey. I went through some of this after I got the deck, and what I realized is two of our reps had taken PTO on a Friday last week, and a lot of these, leads didn't quite make it to that third, fourth step where we usually see a little bit more conversion off of those calls. Right? That's on me. That's something that we're gonna we're gonna own, and and this week, we're gonna make up for it because we're gonna do double the calls, or we expect that to still convert down the line. But that's something that we can do better. And by the way, I did have a conversation with my rep, and and they did say that something they noticed is that a number of leads have been coming through the past couple weeks that don't quite meet the minimum account criteria. Is there any way we could look into to building into our lead scoring, filtering, some kind of stop guards against things like that just so that we're all spending our time with the most effective conversations. So it's I'm admitting something that we can improve, which is a 100% true and on me, but I'm also making an ask where it's like, hey. Based on this feedback, are you willing to to change something and and help us as well? Yeah. I love that. We had the concept of level one, level two metrics. Some people call them leading and lagging metrics. Like, level one metrics are those volume metrics, like number of meetings booked. That's a lagging metric. And then what we'd have is we'd have five to nine different leading metrics that would point to why that lagging metric was bad. Mhmm. And that's where you could easily find the answer. You usually see something in those those leading metrics. And what we decided was if you couldn't find something in the leading metrics, then that meant that it was something so weird, something so one off, something so minor that it would probably just end up fixing itself, which I know is a weird kind of thing to say and a weird approach. But if you're going, like, three or four levels deep in leading metrics and you're not seeing it, then there's something that is either so fundamentally broken, you're just missing it, or it's so nuanced that you're probably never gonna find it and fix it in time anyway. And so I think that's you do need to have your lagging level one metrics that you're on the dashboard. If you're using, like, Tableau or something like that, we'd have a double click in and then it would show the nine leading metrics that would feed that lagging metric. And usually in that second curse, we'd find it now. We're doing our meeting every week, so we didn't really need to have a preread. The preread was a week before in a way. You know what I mean? Once you get in that kind of a rhythm, we really knew what was going on. We didn't need to do it, but I would definitely never recommend having a meeting about a meeting. Having a meeting about a meeting means you have too many meetings. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. So I wanna bring this all the way down to tactical SDR manager level. And, Mark, I'm just gonna piggyback off of what you said. A lot of times, I'll start by just looking at two things, how many meetings did they generate, and where was that their activity volume. And if something seems off, then I'll look at a few of the leading metrics on the meeting. So if activity is constant and meetings are down, that means it's a conversion issue. That's true. For example, for emails, you can learn a lot just by looking at the open rates and the reply rates from last week. And those are two example places where it's like, oh, were open rates way down? We might have a deliverability problem. Were open rates consistent and reply rates were down? Did we change our messaging? And so, usually, you don't have to go that deep to find the answer. My question for you guys is this. I've been coaching one SDR who has really healthy activity volumes, pretty standard in line with SDR. And every week, we're hitting the numbers. And it seems every week, we're trying a new campaign and continuing the old campaigns, and I swear I cannot get this number to go above three meetings per week. It's driving me crazy. Every it's like clockwork. It's not two. It's not four. It's not five. It's three meetings every single week. And I think doing more activity, at least as of right now, is not the best idea due to TAM constraints and other things, and they're doing a lot of activity. But I'm curious. If you see someone flatlining on activity, how do you tend to approach it? Or if you see someone flatlining on meetings booked, how do you tend to lift that number? I think that's where the 20% rule can come into effect where it's like, hey. If you're getting those three meetings on the 80% of workflow that we feel should be there all the time and and we should be able to to recreate all the time, that's really solid. And, hopefully, those three meetings a week are are getting that rep pretty close to their quota or their number. But I think that's where the 20% rule comes in where it's, hey. Let's try something new. And and maybe I think a lot of SDRs, if you say let's try something new, a lot of them have an idea already that they've been waiting to run with and and are excited to launch. And sometimes it's just about working through with them. What do you wanna do? What do you wanna launch right now? I wanna launch a campaign to to go after energy companies in the Southeast United States. Great. Let's go do some research. Let's see what those energy companies care about right now. Let's see what laws and regulations might be going into effect and how their employees might need to be trained with a video learning system that Panopto can help be for them. I think that's where the 20% creativity might help them to unlock that fourth or maybe that fifth meeting that they weren't getting within that standard workflow, which is a lot of onboarding programs are are optimized to to meet that standard workflow and do that 80. And it's a a next step up as an SDR, as a rep to to go own the autonomy around the 20. Yeah. There always is a a danger with people that manage specifically to activity. If I see activity flatlining and results flatlining and the results aren't what I want, but I feel like the activity levels, the the things I digated are one, are they targeting the right people? Because you can hit your activity goal, but be off target. The second is do you have the right surface area? A 100 people in one account is very different than five people at 20 accounts. Right? And it's the right surface area there on accounts and people. The third is right messaging. Have they lost their way on the phone or in their emails? There's something in that they're saying to people that's off. Maybe they're objection handling or something like that. And then the last one is, are they following the right process? You can get in your stuff, but you're not following the SLAs. You're, like, two or three days late on inbound leads or something like that. And so those are, like, my big things. Target, service area, message, process. And there's probably four or five more if I sat around and thought about it. But I think what's most important for a leader, though, is, like, in these scenarios, when you do it, you need to sit down and pause for ten minutes, and just write down, these are the seven things I'm gonna check. Then what you need to do is not just throw them at a rep. You need to make that into something that's a training and a program for your reps, and be like, listen, Let me show you how to self coach. Let me show you the seven things that I look for that you could look for on your own so I don't have to look for them because you're crushing it. Right? And that final step is don't always do it off the cuff in your head. Write it down. There's a book called The Checklist Manifesto. The most important jobs in the world all have checklists. Surgeon, airline pilot. Where there's lives on the line, they have to checklist things, like manually check it. It's funny. I I noticed this the other day. For the first time ever, I saw a pilot do a walk around the plane before I got on the plane. That made me feel a lot safer as somebody about to get on that plane. Right? Because I know that dude's gonna die with me if he finds he's not gonna get on the plane he doesn't feel safe with. Right? Make sure you sit down, think about it, then how do I get my reps to do this on their own? Because now that I have it written down, it's something that I can teach. My checklist is something similar to yours, Mark, and then I try to apply the eighty twenty rule from you, Sunny, every single week. For example, first thing that happens is they pick up accounts. So you can look at the accounts that they're looking at. From there, you need to make sure that they're reaching out to the right people on those accounts. You'd be surprised. If they're having a reply rate issue, oftentimes, it has nothing to do with the messaging. It's just the wrong person got the message in the first place. After accounts, people, you have the trigger. So you might be reaching out to the right accounts with the right people at the wrong time, or you're reaching out to the coldest accounts instead of closed loss opportunities or people who are raising their hand. And then the last one is the messaging. And the most common mistake that I see SDRs, SDR managers, leaders make is they see reply rates go down, and they say, let's rewrite all of our sequences. But oftentimes, if your emails are half decent and they're being sent to the wrong people, like, that's the problem. If you send a half decent email to the right person, it's gonna convert way better than a phenomenal email to the wrong person. And so when you're doing this, have your checklist, but then don't stack on new on new on new. So don't try new accounts with new people, with new messaging, with new triggers. Pick one of them and experiment with that in the 20% for that week alone. Love that. Cool. Alrighty, Sonny. This was an awesome interview. Unfortunately, we have to move to the final question, and it is this. We talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit, but it's time to talk about a bad one. So what is one bad habit that every sales leader should break so that all teams can get a little bit better? One bad habit that sales leaders should break so that everyone else can get a little bit better is knowing everything. I think a lot of sales leaders and leaders in general tend to default to I know the answer to this immediately. And I think the best leaders that I've ever worked with have been able to say, I don't know the answer to that, but here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go find the data we need to make that evaluation to better understand it and make a decision moving forward. That's my commitment to you. Boom. Sunny, amazing show. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Mark. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Sunny Brown. What do you have for your two? Two by two. Number one, managing experimentation is really important so that it doesn't become random or rampant. And his idea of, like, 80% of what my team does is process driven and 20% is newfangled cool stuff that we're trying out. I love that as, like, a rule of thumb. And then the other thing is the metric of MQL to reply, never thought of that. But what a great way to measure interest and engagement in putting them together. I think that was a really cool metric to to keep track of. Number three. I loved the same four slides every single time you jump into a weekly or monthly build the pipe meeting. The four slides that he had were leads by each source, conversion by lead source, conversion from meeting to op by lead source, and then total pipeline amount. And then the last one is one that came from you, Sunny, and a little bit of me, which is have your solving top of funnel problem punch list. So if you see that reply rates are down or meetings are down, you start with the accounts, then you go to people on the accounts, then you go to the trigger, then you go to the messaging. Don't just jump and start refigure out where the problem is first, and then do one thing to fix that problem. Alrighty, folks. If you like this one, Mark and I actually recorded an episode together a while back called how to fix your outbound problem, and we went through Mark's whole lead funnel, all the metrics he tracks, and then different ways you can fix your funnel. That is 100% a skill set in the language that you'll need to learn how to speak if you even wanna be a director of sales, let alone a VP of sales or CRO. So, folks, I know this metric stuff can sometimes sound a little bit more scientific. Get to learn it if you wanna do more than just doing call coaching every single day. Alrighty? Go check that show out. It's down in the show notes. Catch you on the next one.
