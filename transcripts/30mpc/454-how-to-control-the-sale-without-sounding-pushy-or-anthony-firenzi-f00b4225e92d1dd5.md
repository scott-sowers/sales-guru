## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my host, Nick Skalski. And, folks, today, we have back on by popular request. It is Anthony Firenze. If you don't remember him, he's the head of sales over at Unified GTM. He was Lattice's number one rep. Four and a half years in a row, he hit over a 100% quota attainment, never miss. And in his most recent quarter or in his first quarter leading the Unify Revenue Organization, he did 197 of his quota, which is absolutely bonkers as a head of sales. Nick, why should people listen? So I think the biggest paradigm shift that you're gonna learn from Anthony in this episode is there's a lot of salespeople out there who think your job is to ask questions of your prospect. What's your buying process look like? How long does procurement take? What would you like to see in the demo? And don't get me wrong. You do need to ask good questions. But Anthony's really, really good at not necessarily asking, but prescribing or recommending. And so if you wanna learn how to, like, guide or steer or shift the conversation in your favor, Anthony is very, very good at that. He gets into things like shifting your comms with your prospects onto Slack instead of on email. He talks about how you can demo to an exec versus to a champion. We also get into how you can navigate a negotiation. He's leading a team right now of nine or 10 AEs and helping all of those people negotiate, like, pretty hefty numbers every single month. And so if you want a structured, really, really great set of talk tracks that he uses, that comes towards the back half of this episode. And three, two, one. Let's roll. Alright, Anthony. Welcome back to the show. You may remember that we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get yours. First one is add your prospects to Slack. Don't have to ask them for permission just like you would send an email, but this is gonna create faster lines of communication. You can intro them into a customer or a reference directly, which is really cool. And sociologically and psychologically, multiple pings in Slack is acceptable, where if I sent you three emails in a day, you'd think I'm crazy. Hey, Sarah. I wanna be respectful of your professional inbox. I find Slack is far less intrusive for our partners. I'm just gonna add you there after this call. Awesome. What's number two? Number two is being prescriptive at every step. Instead of asking for permission constantly or asking, hey. Have you purchased software before? Who's gonna sign off? Is that you? What feels right as far as pricing? Tell them. You've done thousands of these. They've purchased the software probably once, maybe twice max. You're the expert. A seller should know the risks in a deal better than their buyer does. Hey, Arman. To be honest, I've done hundreds of these, if not thousands. And if we don't get x person in the room, what happens is we do a ton of work together. We get to the one yard line. You're excited. I'm excited. My manager's excited, and it falls through on the one yard line. So what we need to do is we need to get that person involved or this won't happen. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Anthony. I'll be honest. I've done hundreds of these episodes, and if you don't give us tip number three, it's gonna be kinda awkward. So what's number three? Wanna do a reverse demo. So a lot of times, what I'll do for that second demo when they've already seen the platform or even earlier, I'll say, hey, Nick. Can you open up your computer for me and share and show me exactly how you do that? That way I can learn exactly what their process is. I can know, is it easy? They'll probably feel the anxiety of this is a little janky, and I need a better solution. For an example, at my company, I'll say, hey. Show me how you go prospect and find a bunch of people at account, craft an email, and actually send it to them. They open up Sales Nav. They click around a bunch. They link it back to Salesforce. They open up their Outreach extension. They type a custom email. Then they send and hope that it lands in their inbox. We're my company. We do all of that autonomously for them. So, Anthony, you gave us an example around prescribing to your prospect why it's important to multithread or get more people involved. You also, in the prep, talked about how this this doesn't just happen when you're trying to get to power. This literally happens on the first discovery call. So could you give an example of, like, one of the first times that you'll be prescribing a prospect on, like, how to buy your software the right way? We'll tie it into the reverse demo. I'll say, hey. You know what? Everyone uses tools a little bit differently. I have a lot of experience with Xtool, but show me how you use it. You also gave an example in the prep around, like, the intro call, where you'll be like, hey. What made you reach out to us? You requested a demo on our site. And they were like, oh, yeah. We're just we're just browsing. We're just looking around. And you almost prescribe to them the problems that you think they have or the things you think they should be thinking about. Could you talk about how the talk track goes from there on that very first interaction? Yeah. I think about it walking into a store. If I walk into a store and say I'm just browsing, it means I'm not buying. If I was a seller or I was working in that store, I would say, hey, Nick. You know, normally when people walk in here, it's because they're looking for, like, fresher clothes or they're looking something maybe they're not used to. Actually, you know, sometimes you're here to buy something for a second or third time. Is that the case? Now I can open them up. They're gonna put their guard down. They're gonna tell me. In software, it's the same thing. Mhmm. When customers come to us, when prospects come to us, it's usually for these three reasons. Do you fit in one of those buckets right now? If not, tell me why now. Could you fill in what those three reasons sound like for either Unify or when you were at Lattice? Like, what you would say, like, from a TalkTraq perspective? It could be something as simple as, like, hey. You know what? Our execs are interested in AI, and they told us to book a demo. That's way too nebulous. They're never gonna sign a contract to this. So I need to prescribe to them why AI is important in prospecting in top of funnel. Mhmm. It's bringing a bunch of tools together, enabling your humans so they can do better work. Maybe it is doing some type of scale or more pointed work as well. So for us, we're gonna capture intense signals and reach out to the right people at the right time instead of, like, 2018 when I was at BDR and say, hey. You know what? I'm gonna email all 1,000 of these companies, and I'm gonna book five meetings. Anthony, what do you do when you get onto a call and you sense that someone is asking about problems or bringing problems to the table that you know never lead to a sale. So for example, when I was at Pave, we had a compensation planning tool and then, like, a visual offer letter, and you had to buy them together. So if someone came in to, like, look at the visual offer letter, we were like, oh, crap. Like, this is gonna be like a two k deal if I can't get them over to the compensation stuff. How do you do that without just, like, being like, hey. Like, I know that's the problem you came to solve, but go look at this stuff instead. How do you, like, artfully navigate that? Yeah. I think this is where asking a question then being prescriptive is important. At Lattice, people would wanna come in and purchase engagement surveys all the time. That was not our bread and butter. Our bread and butter was combining performance management analytics with your engagement analytics. So I would always let them know, like, hey. Do you know how your top performers are feeling in your engagement surveys? Answer would always be no. There's no way for them to do that. Let me show you something really cool and why Lattice is different, and it would be worth your investment. I would then layer in the performance data. We'd call it a wow moment. Once they see that, they understand that they should at least make it an evaluation. So what you're doing is someone came for engagement surveys, and then you found the linkage between engagement surveys and your performance review product, and you just asked a problem question about that, which was like, how do you know how your top performers feel in your engagement surveys? And that's what creates the bridge between a product that always sells and a product that doesn't sell. Is that right? What I wanna do is you came in for a reason. I wanna pull on that string. I'm not saying, oh, you should look at performance reviews. I'm saying, you know what? You came here for engagement surveys. Super important. You wanna know how to make engagement surveys even more impactful? You're at Unify. I wanna give you another example here. And Unify, to my knowledge, has, like, a million different workflows that you can work through. Right? It's like all these different types of things. And when I'm on a discovery call, I'm usually like, okay. I've gotta get, like, two or three big problems before I go into a demo. And if I only have one, it better be, like, a really fat problem. Otherwise, like, that's not gonna be enough to hold up in a demo and ultimately in a proposal. I'm curious for you. How do you know when it's time to transition from discovery and finding use cases for them into pitching? Are you, like, mapping out a couple of potential workflows and use cases? Like, how do you actually play that out in a discovery call? I think it's different for everyone. So every call, your prospect will let you know. If they're done with the questions, you can see it on their face. They'll start disengaging, and I wanna go into the platform immediately once I see that. But for some people who have a million problems, I go, oh god. We're actually gonna have too many things. I don't know what they care about the most. Either pause and have them stack rate, which is very traditional sales methodology, or I actually pull up the demo sooner. Armand, that point was actually really, really important. This is how we're doing it. There's a bunch of different ways we can go from here. What do you care about the most? That way, they are navigating through the platform with me, and they are opting into this journey together rather than me just saying, paying product value. We're changing it up a little bit, and we're doing it together. How much product are you actually showing in your first thirty minute call with a customer? A disrespectful amount. One of our leaders on the CS team was making a joke about how little our prospects were seeing the platform before they were actually signing on. Being able to speak to it really eloquently and succinctly is far more important than being able to go in and tell them about every single nut and bolt within the platform. That's actually something we've even been working on in selling our sponsorships at thirty minutes to presidents club, where, like, sometimes a customer will ask us about, like, okay. Like, could you give us some examples of, like, you know, what ROI tracking looks like? And there's a right way and a wrong way to address that question. The wrong way is to pull up 12 different ROI case studies and go through every single line item of our customer QBRs. The right way is to say, Well, look, every customer tracks us a little bit differently. Some people look at direct source pipeline, others look at influenced pipeline. I've got some case studies I could take you through. I guess I'm curious, like, how are you measuring the success of your sponsorship engagements? And when you keep it high enough level and show, like, there's some depth there, you can go deeper if you want, but I don't need to pull up a visual aid. It keeps the conversation, I think, at the right altitude so that you can keep exploring multiple use cases and, like, the vision as opposed to getting trapped in the depths or the weeds? I think first and foremost, like, humans in general just deeply wanna be understood. No one wants to be like, I don't want anyone to understand my pain or what I'm going through or who I am as an individual. Yeah. So that's where listening is very important. But you have to be able to tell them, I get what you are saying. This happens with other people. You are not alone. Here's how we can potentially make it better. I wanna talk about the wrap of your first call with a customer, those last, like, five to six minutes where you're setting next steps. There's a couple different things. One, you talked about, like, getting on Slack comms with them, and I'm curious if you can share a little bit more about that. Two, you mentioned some stuff upfront around, like, how prescriptive you are with, like, this is where we should go next versus asking them where should we go next. And then you also had something in the preshow we were talking about about, like, your video follow-up versus, like, a text based follow-up. And I'm wondering if you can speak to, like, how you do follow ups differently than other salespeople. I wanna get people on Slack because, truly, I can probably send you two or three short Slacks, and it is okay. We do that all day in our own work. If someone is using Slack, they're giving me a green light to say, hey. Send me a few messages. It could be short thoughts. It could be longer. But people want to be able to get information not only quickly, but, like, in a digestible manner. Where I see sales reps do follow-up wrong is they want to align something about their company with everything that the prospect said. It's been hours and hours and hours on follow-up, when in reality, it should be salutation, what we heard, what you want, what we are going to do about it, next step, and that's probably already too long. If I had more time, I would have written less. Anthony, this is not just something that needs to happen in recap. A lot of times, when you try to pitch each feature, each workflow, people lose sight of the broader vision and the biggest problem they're trying to solve. When you're, like, trying to, like, put it all together and, like, this is one big vision for, like, everything last can do for you based on what you've told me, This is everything Unify can do for you independent of, like, these two workflows that you talked about. I'm curious, like, how are you doing that without listing out all of the different things? And even if you have, like, an example of what you would say, that would be helpful. I'll use Unify as an easier an easier example in this instance just because that the front of my mind. We do have a lot of tools. There's many things that could happen. In reality, it's a simple workflow. We go and find the right people for you. We find them at the right time because of our intent signals. We are then going to send them the right messaging, and it's gonna land in their inbox because we manage deliverability. A lot of people are interested right now. If I were to walk through the three tools that do all three of those things, you're gonna lose me. It's gonna be really confusing. But more importantly, Armand and Nick, no offense, you probably don't have power. Someone else probably does. Mhmm. You're not gonna be able to relay that information. So when you get the sense that a champion who might be at or slightly below the line is like, we'll call him a rev ops goon. We love our rev ops goons around here. And they're like, super, you can do this workflow, and that's that's how they talk. You know? And they, like they're obsessed with the technical details. And you know the CRO of the company hasn't used a computer since Microsoft Excel was launched in 1997. How do you bridge that communication gap, or how do you teach your champion to, like, speak the language of an executive so that, like, they can speak to that same vision? My follow-up will be something that they can forward. I want them to be able to pass it along. It's not just directly to Armand. I want to send an email follow-up where it's extremely shareable, digestible, and something that anyone can read and understand. One of my sales mentors, Justin King, he taught me, be able to demo your product like you're teaching it to your mother. One layer beyond that, be able to demo your product without the demo even being on your computer. Can you sell me your product without showing me your product? That's how good you need to be, how much you need to know your product and your value props to actually be proficient and be a top 1% seller. Could you talk about what an executive demo would look like versus what a champion or deep dive demo might look like? Executive demos, very little salutations. I'm doing for sure a bunch of research about what they care about. Takes two seconds to go figure out, like, what a company is probably going through at any given time between headcount, funding rounds. Are they losing employees? Did they launch a new product? Show the executive you care about the business, not about the person. That's usually the way I like to frame it because that's their job. Take care of the business. From there, I'm going through the demo. In an executive demo, they care about growing the business. Maybe they're raising around. Hey. To go get a series b, we know that they want you to see that you have 40% more pipeline than you did last quarter. How are you gonna do that with the team you have today in the same motion? You need some type of uplift. Unify can do that for you. For a champion demo, they're gonna be the ones living in the weeds. Hey. You need something that's actually better day to day where you can go and it's easier to use so you can impress your executive. That's Unify. Usually top down or bottom up. So, Anthony, I'm thinking about, like, the topic that we started this interview with, which was the concept of, like, prescribing the customer, like, the direction you think they need to go as opposed to being, like, what do you wanna see? What do you wanna do next? And And I'm thinking about it in the context of negotiation, where you're never going to be like, What do you want to pay? I'll make it work. Because like oftentimes what the customer wants to pay and what we can do, those just don't align with reality. And so I'm wondering if you can talk to me, like when you get to the back half of the sale, when it's, like, there's clearly fit here, like, you're clearly solving media enough problems for them, and they start trying to pull on your price or pull on your commercial terms or get more for less, what's your approach to navigating a negotiation? Typically that I have no power, and I've been lucky enough that at every level, it's it's been somewhat true. Well, sales reps will have, like, discount matrix, or they know what they can get from their manager or their VP or even their CFO. I'm letting the buyer know I have no power. I'm on your team. Really, my framework, what I'm trying to do is I am trying to go in there and I'm trying to let them know I understand. They want x and I understand y. This is why you will not get that. This is how we will get something. So if I'm the buyer and I'm like, look. I'm just gonna make up numbers here. And I'm like, Anthony, you're you're priced at $1,500 a month, and I'll be honest, like, we just can't swing that kind of budget. That's insane. You know, I need you to get me your best price. How do you respond in those scenarios? I love that. I can't afford $1,500 a month to buy this software either, so I'm with you. There's a reason it's structured this way. I know exactly how to get our best price. To get our best price, though, I need a few things. We have to be vendor of choice. My CFO cares the most about time of sign. Could we sign up in the next week? And buying more product. If you were gonna purchase a larger package, I know you were in between package a and package b. If you package package b, you're gonna see a larger percentage taken off the top rather than package a. So buyer goes, well, so so what would that actually look like? I know we were thinking about package a, and it was $1,500. Package b's 2,200. Like, are you saying you can get that even below 1,000? I've seen x done before, but I'll be honest. I can't go get any information until you give me that info, and I go to my CFO. He's the big bad wolf. She's the big bad wolf. I have no power here. But what I'm gonna do is is I'm gonna put on my thirty minutes to presidents club hat, and I'm gonna work for you all here. I just need a little bit of information. Yeah. I mean, I think the biggest thing for us is, like, I was hoping to get this thing around a thousand dollars a month. And, yeah, we probably could sign. I don't know this week because it's Thursday, and I'm out tomorrow. But, you know, obviously, we'd have to look at the contract and make sure that, like, everything in that is straightforward. But, like, if there's no major red lines or changes my legal procurement team needs to make, I think we could probably do it not next week, maybe midweek, the week after. I don't know if that's gonna change things with your CFO, though. Yeah. Probably will. To be honest, nobody pays that price for the software, so we definitely would have to find something else. Why don't we sit down, figure out what's realistic from your team? What I can do is I can go to bat for you, and I can come back with options. Where do you try to take things from here? Are you gonna try to keep pulling out from me, like, exactly where I need to land, or do you go in a different direction? I wanna get to a no. And what's funny is everyone says they wanna get to a no, but from the prospect's end, I actually wanna get to a point where I say no, where I feel comfortable saying, won't happen. Yeah. Now we're on the floor. Now the prospect understands, hey. Okay. I went too far. This is the realm we need to live in. Here's our swimming lanes. Now that we have those swimming lanes Mhmm. We at least can progress the conversation or be professional or get this going somewhere. Negotiation goes nowhere when you say, give me your best price, and you say, let me go figure out what that is for you. One of the things that you talked about was you positioned your CFO. She really cares about, like, the date by which this is signed, signature date. How much do you care about that signature date being I think the example you gave was, like, this week. How much do you care about the signature date being this week or this month versus knowing exactly when that signature date is and getting a commitment for that? If we can solidify a signature date, I know my CFO. She's really, really tough. If I walk in there and say you can sign up on April 19, you're gonna see a much larger price adjustment. If I go in there and say they can sign up this month, she'll probably give us, like, a five to 10% adjustment. So you say the sooner you sign, the bigger cut you get. Interesting. I hadn't thought about it that way, because normally what I do is I care the most about the predictability. I basically try to figure out what's a normal timeline for you. If we're at April 17 today, your procurement process takes six weeks, I'm like, Alright, can we get that down to four? I need you to sign by this date right here. I need you to sign whatever by May 17. But what I'm hearing from you is you almost have a sliding scale of, Hey, if if you can do it in four weeks, you get a 10% discount, but if you can do it in two weeks, you'll get a 15% discount. I should have done this in discovery and figured out what their buying process was, so I already know. I already know everything, and I know that they have no procurement, no legal. It's gonna be make sure there's not a crazy line item in the contract, and they're gonna sign. Yeah. If that was the reality, I probably would tie it to, like, this week. Like, can you sign tomorrow on Friday if I go get you something? Because I know they have a longer procurement process. I'm I'm never gonna make it the last day of the month because that's gonna slip into May for sure. Totally. But I'll make it April 27, April 26. Well, to that point, even around the holidays, like, I'll never forget this one year when I was, an AE selling this ERP software, and we were giving year end commercial incentives for people to sign before the end of the year. I had a great big fat pipeline because I worked really hard that year with my prospecting, and I told all of my deals that were, like, in Q4 or Q1 close, I was like, hey, if you sign by 12:31, you've got this discount available to you. I regretted that so much, not offering that discount, but by making it 12:31. Because the last day of the year, I kid you not, I was selling to law firms. I was on the phone with three different managing partners of these law firms negotiating red lines. There was a managing partner, he was literally at a holiday party, and he's like on his phone looking at the Google Doc with the red lines, and it was so freaking stressful. And if I had just, like, said, Hey, 12:30 instead of 12:31? I would have given myself so much more slack, because people push to the deadline. And what I do now is end the year, I'm like, Look, I don't wanna be doing this over the holidays. I know you don't either. Like, our cutoff is 12:20. And then if we do have a push, like, we can renegotiate from there. So I I really love the set the deadline not as the last day of the month. And you can do it both ways too. I could be, hey, Nick. You know what? We're in a fortunate space where a ton of people sign up at the end of the month. My CFO, she's a little more reserved to give out pricing adjustments because she's signing so many documents at the end of the month. You can sign up sooner, much more likely that you get a pricing adjustment. The inverse, hey, Nick. We've had a pretty good month. The end of the month rolls around. My CFO's pen is on fire. They wanna sign every single agreement, get it done, get it done, get it done. So then if you are later in the month, you know that they'll still get a good deal. Anthony, my guess is there are deals where you know your vendor of choice, they are dying to buy you. And every once in a while, you might get someone who isn't negotiating you at all or very hard. And this would happen with my top performer, Morgan Mello. She'd get these deals where she'd have them in forecast as commit, but she'd be like, hey. I'm just gonna give you a heads up. There's no discount on this deal. Like, they're committing on this date, and I know they're gonna close, but I don't wanna throw in a discount on this date to lock it in. So if you decide not to discount on a deal, are there other ways you can lock in timeline to make sure that they actually sign on time even when you know they're gonna sign eventually? The prescheduled implementation call. What is it? It's April 17. I know your CFO is is Nick, and Nick is going to sign. We are good to go. We have a project and a timeline. I wanna make sure you are up and running and get to success as fast as possible. CSM Danny is the absolute best. I wanna schedule with that person. They have a call on April 21 open. Can you do that time? Yes. Lock it in. Now when you're talking to legal and your CFO, you say, hey. Actually, we need this done on the nineteenth because the weekend's gonna roll around, and we have a kickoff call on the twenty first. We've been using that one here at thirty minutes to presidents club also, and I really, really like it because it's less about, like, sometimes customers are like, ah, discount for timeline, whatever. I'm sure if I miss it by a day, we'll be fine. But, like, there's something about the kickoff call is literally related to their project to solve this problem, and you are driving timeline based on something that is, like, truly in your champion's best interest. They they're not gonna feel that pricing discount because it's not their money, but they are gonna feel if the project doesn't kick off when they wanted it to. And I kid you not, like, we had a customer gosh. This was probably six months ago where we prescheduled the kickoff call. And at the eleventh hour, there was, like, a red line change, and they missed their signature date. And they were still like, let's get on. We're gonna have it signed before the kickoff call. And I'm like, alright. Cool. We get on. It's, like, twenty minutes before the kickoff call. I'm like, we haven't gotten it. And they're like, well, we'll get we'll get it signed on the call. And I get on the call, and I'm like, folks, like, we literally can't kick this thing off. It was literally me and my CSM, and they're pinging their legal team on Slack, and we got the contract signed fifteen minutes into the kickoff call. We did not start the kickoff call until fifteen minutes in, but you better believe, like, I could see it driving timeline with this customer. I love using that one. Anthony, we've talked about a bunch of awesome things in this episode, but the clock is ticking. Just like the timeline for me to close my deals, we gotta ask you about one last question, which we've talked about a bunch of good habits salespeople should be exhibiting. Now I gotta ask you about a bad habit. So the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a bunch of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Overthinking and creating latency. You should have a process. You know what works. You're the expert at your company. You should be sending the right information as succinct as possible. Love it. Thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a succinct sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Anthony Ferenzi. What do you have for your two? So number one is when your buyer asks you for a discount, you've gotta let them know that you are not the person who makes these final calls. You need to have somebody else have power in the negotiation. In this example, Anthony says, hey. I don't make those calls. I have to go make a case to my CFO, and here's what my CFO cares about. Let's talk about what you might be able to do so I can go make that case to her. Number two is when you are actually offering that discount, he recommends using a sliding scale where they get a steeper discount if they sign sooner. So they might get a 10% discount if they sign by April 15. They might get a 15% discount if they sign by April 1. And so give them incentives to sign sooner rather than later. Number three, steer the demo and the discovery in the directions of the problems and solutions that can actually drive a signature. So if someone's, like, asking about, like, niche workflows, don't be afraid to recommend the most common workflows that, you know, actually move the needle for a sales team. And then lastly, number four, if you don't have to discount, you can still drive timeline by prescheduling the implementation call, and that's a light lock in on a deal that saves you probably 10% on your ACV.
