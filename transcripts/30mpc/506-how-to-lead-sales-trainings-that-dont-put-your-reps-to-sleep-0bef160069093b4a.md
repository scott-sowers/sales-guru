## Transcript

Most sales leaders do absolute jack in terms of preparing their team to sell in any way, shape, or form. They pass off all training to enablement. No one pays attention. They either fall asleep. They turn their camera off. They go on Slack, and nothing actually sticks after you do these useless forty eight hour sales kickoff training sessions. So in this module, we are going to teach you, one, how to design a training program that actually wakes your reps up and teaches them something new. Two, we will teach you how to reinforce the training using what we call coaching rhythms. And then three, we will teach you how to make sure that you know that this training program actually worked, AKA it's stuck and you can see the results of it. So first, Mark, let's talk about the difference between training and coaching. Training is teaching somebody something new. Think of that like a lecture. Coaching is demonstrating and modeling and helping somebody reinforce what you just learned. So if I train somebody how to do discovery call, I would be like, this is how we do a discovery call. Follow these steps. Coaching then is taking them through a role play. Coaching is then looking at a live call and telling them how they have done the process or not done the process. And, unfortunately, in most orgs, training is where everything stops. We do some training, enablement does something, we say something in a team meeting, and then we completely lose reinforcement. That would be like your math teacher teaching you algebra and never giving you any homework, never giving you an exam, never doing anything. So that doesn't work. So what we need to do instead is we need to make sure that we train and teach, and then we coach by reinforcing. So, Mark, would you give me, like, an example of how I could construct a training program if I wanted to teach my reps something? Slow down. Okay. Arman, you're already making the mistake. Alright. No. First of all, we have to decide how do we prioritize what we want to train. And there's three kind of levels that training come from. First of all, as an org initiative. Hey. We're launching a new product, or we have a new sales methodology that we're gonna do. The second one is kind of enablement of how we're gonna do that or maybe something that you see as a manager that you want to do. Right? Hey. We have to roll out MEDDPIC now. We have to figure that out. Or, like, I'm seeing I need a qualification thing for my team. And then the third level is the personal initiatives. Like, hey. You know what? Arman really needs help with this specific part of the deal cycle, so I need to work with Arman. So the first thing we have to do is look at what level that we want to teach or the skill that we wanna bring about is coming from so that we can prioritize it correctly. So from there, how do I think about how much my team can take on in any given month or quarter? This is important because many times we try to push too much down to reps, and then they can't digest it, and therefore, it doesn't change their behaviors or the outcomes. I've developed a sales enablement matrix that does two things. One is that it tells you how big of a program do you need to create to get an outcome you want, and secondly, it sets expectations with the people around you of what they can expect you to deliver with that program. The way that it works is it's a nine box. The x axis is capability. Capability is defined as aware, competent, or mastery. Aware means we're gonna know know about it. You might hear it 10 or 20% of the time out in the wild. Competent is 50 to 60% of the time, you're gonna hear it the way you want. Mastery is 80 to 90% of the time, you're gonna hear it the way that you want. That's on the x axis. On the y axis, we have cognitive load. That's how hard is it gonna be for a rep to make the mental changes and adjustments that they need in order to do the outcome that you want. That's low, medium, high. We now have a nine box, and what we do is for every initiative, we say, what level of capability we want? What's the cognitive load? You plot it on the box, and that's the number of points that you get for that specific initiative. At Outreach, we found out that you could do about 16 points of enablement per quarter. You might be different, but that's how you figure out, you know what? I can't do two mastery level high cognitive load initiatives because that's 18 points. So when you're mastery level high cognitive load initiatives because that's 18 points. So when your CEO is like, hey. We're launching a new product. You need to change a demo. And, oh, yeah. I want this new sales process. That's when you pump your brakes and say, you know what? Can't do that. And I'll give you a story about this. Manny, the CEO at Outreach came to me one day, and he's like, Mark, you know what? We're launching this new product. I also would like to revamp the demo, and there's this other thing with forecasting I'd like you to do. And I was like, woah, dude. I'll tell you what. No problem. Please tell finance that what I would like them to do is close the books in two days, change over our ERP system, completely revamp our pricing and packaging. He's like, dude, we can't do that. That's insane. I was like, that's what you just asked me to do. And there's some kind of dissonance between executives and salespeople. And what executives think is, if I have decided that this will change, the salespeople can immediately make that change. That's not humanly possible. It takes real change management efforts to get somebody to change. So that's what we wanna do is we wanna create a way for you to say no and yes and a way to set expectations and understand how big of a program you need to build to get the changes you want. So folks, Tillyard, don't try to train your team on new discovery methodology, new forecasting methodology, new AE prospecting methodology. Basically, all the things we talked about in section one, don't teach them all at the exact same time. Dose these one month, one quarter, one week at a time, and solve one problem at a time. So we're gonna go through three example training programs that you could build at three different levels of competency. So we're gonna go through a mastery program that you'd run over a quarter, a competent program that you would run over a month, and then just an awareness program that you would run over a week. So let's start with a mastery program that you'd run over a quarter. So let's say that I'm gonna do a training at the mastery level on revamping our entire discovery process. That's gonna be a high cognitive load. This is gonna be a quarter long project. Week one, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go over the overview of everything that's gonna happen inside of that discovery, and we're gonna take one piece of it. So in my discovery, one of the things is dig the pain hole. That's mean, like, getting the second and third level pain. I'm gonna emphasize that in training for the entire first month, and we're gonna reinforce that with ongoing coaching the entire month. We're not gonna handle the other aspects of the discovery training yet. We have an entire quarter to get this right. Let's break it down into pieces. The first piece is digging the pain hole. The second piece is diagnose and confirm. We're gonna do that in month two. We're gonna go deep into it. All of our call coaching is gonna be around that. We'll revisit the first month stuff every once in a while, but we're mainly gonna focus now on making sure that we can diagnose and confirm. And the last thing is a brief vision of the future. That's the last part. We'll do that in month three in the first week, really emphasize it, and then we're gonna reinforce and start to tell reps that they need to submit their live prospect calls so that we can certify them against those. So folks notice a couple things here. Number one, Mark is teaching one part of the discovery process each month. So a lot of times people will be like, here's your agenda. Here's your discovery questions. Here's your next steps. Here are 17 stories. And then they're mad when someone doesn't remember, like, story number 16 in the second week because they still haven't figured out how to set an agenda. So you've either gotta be, like, okay with them just, like, understanding the parts but not getting it all correct, or you've gotta zone in on, like, one part really, really deep. Part number two is for each section, he's reinforcing that specific part of the discovery call. So step number one was dig the pain hole. All of Mark's call reviews are focused on digging the pain hole. And then if step number two in month two is all about diagnose and confirm, well, then all of those call reviews and role plays should be focused on diagnosing and confirming. I'm gonna use the same example of discovery, but instead of taking it to mastery, I'm only gonna take it to competency. Well, now that it's incompetency, it only requires a month long reinforcement and training process. So I'm going in the first week to go over all the steps, give them the introduction of everything that we're gonna do, then I'm gonna take those three steps and then the remaining three minutes of the month. I'm gonna do one step each week instead of one step a month for mastery. Now you can see the difference. Mastery is we are gonna focus on this. It's gonna be part of our DNA. Everybody I'm gonna get on a call, everybody gonna do it the same way. Competence is we don't have as much time. I got some other big stuff. I need to see some improvements here, but I know I'm not gonna hear it exactly how I want to. And you're starting to see we're building a program to meet the expectations that we're gonna set with other people around what they can expect us to deliver around these training issues. Now let's say we take this down to awareness. At this point, it's probably not even worth running a week long discovery program. I feel like awareness level is really only for, like, very tiny things you would want your team to be aware of. Like, you need to know that we have this new integration or you need to know that this, like, feature is slightly changing. Not like you need to be generally aware of discovery as an AE. That seems like an undertone. Right. I think one thing that you could do is say, hey. We're gonna be developing a new discovery process. Here's some training that you can go on your own and take a look at. Right? You don't need them to do anything with it. You're not expecting them to take it on their own, but you're showing them, hey. I want you to be aware that we're moving in this direction. You might do that in q two before you hit them hard in q three with doing the entire quarter long process. So, Mark, I might be thinking, shoot, this is a lot more meetings if I'm doing deal coaching or deal reviews every single week. I'm doing reinforcement rhythms every single week. You talked about finding a way to make sure that your reinforcement rhythms are not new meetings. They're using your existing coaching rhythms. Could you talk about that a little bit more? I have four basic rhythms that we run-in two different buckets. The four rhythms are deal reviews, team meetings, biweekly one on ones, and then kind of our org wide coaching. The first two, deal reviews and team meetings, are much more around process. Are we running the forecast process? Is our sales process running right? Are is our AEs prospecting? You talk about the deal reviews for sales and forecasting, and your team meetings is where you might talk about your AE prospecting workflow. The second bucket is skill based. This is where I wanna teach somebody how to do a discovery call, how to do negotiations. That would be in your biweekly one on ones where you're doing personal development with people and skill development or in this biweekly team training where you might do, like, a group call coaching session. Let's take two examples because, again, there's two buckets of these meetings. What you don't wanna do is take your one on ones and talk about your forecasting methodology. What you wanna do is you wanna take your deal review and make sure that you use that for forecasting. That's where we're gonna take exactly what we learned in one of the other modules, and we're gonna make sure that they're thinking about forecasting the right way. And if they're not, we're going to ask them the questions that help them realize that how they're off, and then we're gonna guide them to the right way of thinking, and we're gonna reinforce that week after week after week. If it's a skill based thing, let's say that we're teaching them new discovery skills. In that, what we would do is we do our training, but in our biweekly one on one or in our team meeting, that's where we would slot in the, oh, you know what? We wanna make sure today that we do our team call coaching on our new discovery process. We're not gonna just do a random call about a big deal. Bring your enablement into your regular operating rhythm meetings, and you kinda kill two birds with one stone. You get the reinforcement of the training that you've already done, and you also get to fill those containers with things that are valuable, and it makes you look consistent as a leader. So if I've trained my team on forecasting this quarter, I reinforce that in DO reviews. If I've trained my team on discovery, I can reinforce that in team meeting one on ones or org wide skill building sessions. Very rarely do you need to schedule a new meeting on top of your rhythms. Instead, whenever you're training your team on something new, try to reinforce it in one of your existing four rhythms. And pro tip is if you find yourself creating new meetings, you've probably overtrained and overdone it with your reps. If you can't fit what you're training and teach them into the established rhythms, you don't have enough rhythm or you're trying to do too much. So let's walk through some of the keys to running trainings that don't suck, which is pretty uncommon on Salesforce. The first one is is pick the best rep to run the meeting. Alright? Top reps that can demonstrate the skill that use it every single day, they're the best people to train it. They have the cloud. They have the street cred. They have the attention to those people. People wanna know how they're winning. Use those top reps in order to do your training. You as a manager can also do the training, and that's not bad either, but you have to be willing to demonstrate it in front of reps in live calls. Don't be doing trainings with your team internally and then not showing them how to do that stuff in live calls. Great pro tip on this one is take a something that someone needs that you find in their deal review. You find out, oh, they're having trouble getting an eye date and say this, your next call for that deal, why don't you have me come in and I'll model for you how to get that eye date in real time you can watch me do it? That is a way to get street cred. That's real training right there that people care about. It moves deals. The last person that you should bring in to do training is your enablement team. However, the the first person you should bring in when you're thinking about doing training, their job is to help support you in delivering the materials and the concepts in the right way, but their job isn't to do your training. That's your rep's job on your team and your job. Alright. Now we need to run a great meeting and do a great training because we have a great person. The key to this is show, don't tell. 70% of us are visual learners, and all of us learn better experientially with our hands on something. So let's take cold call training as an example. The first thing I'm gonna do is lay out the framework. The framework for me is opener, provocative question, green turkey, and then three strikes and you're out. Then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna break each one of those steps down and show how they interrelate. What do they actually mean? How do they actually work? Once I have that, I'm gonna have reps talk to me about how they might make it their own. What changes would they make? How would they think it would do? How does their personality fit into this? Once we have that locked in, we go straight into role plays and get over that hesitancy of trying a new skill. If you do those four things, explain the whole picture, break down the parts individually, make sure that they have a sense of ownership, and, like, I can put my own little salt and pepper on this and season it the way I like to. And then lastly, do a great role play to start to lock in it with an experiential learning, situation. That's how you turn something from a lecture that people ignore and do Slack during into something that people look forward to because they can feel themselves changing and adopting the new skills that'll help them. One of the things I like to say is process makes you great, but documentation makes you legendary. So the things that we've taught you are processes. If you adopt them, you're gonna be great. If you actually write them down and memorialize them in a document, all of a sudden, you're gonna become legendary. And so what I mean by that is is when you do a training, create a one pager for yourself. Like, how would I have done this if I was a manager? When you're a VP, I'm telling you, you're gonna go grab those documents to help your your managers out. Right? There's a one pager for the rep. Give the rep something to tangibly hand hold on to, maybe something that they can put on their desk while they're in a call to reference while they're doing these things. Right? Those are things that really make a difference, and it goes from, hey. My manager just had this cool idea to train me on to this guy is freaking prepared. He's got paperwork. He's showing me how to do it. I've got leave behinds to help me with this. That kind of seriousness from the manager creates seriousness in the rep. Folks, it's not super hard to do this stuff. If you have a deck, you can present the deck, plug it into ChatGPT, and then have ChatGPT spit out a Notion doc that bullet points out a lot of the outlines that you need and then just store those inside of Notion or a Google Doc or something like that. You do not have to be this brilliant graphic designer to build basic enablement handbooks. They can literally be three by three bullet outlines, and that is more than most sales teams have. So now that you've got the right person, now that you've done an effective training, how do you know if it actually works? There's two ways. Quantitative. That means that you pick a metric that you want to move, and you make sure that it moves. And there's bad metrics and good metrics. A bad metric, for example, with discovery would be like, we wanna increase our win rates. Win rates are pretty distant from the discovery process. There's a lot of other things that can affect the win rate. A better metric would be, what does our stage one to stage two conversion look like? That's what is meaningful in that specific area of the sales process. So quantitative is a metric. Make sure that it's really close and as tight to the behavior that you're trying to get as possible. The other one is qualitative. We wanna hear things like, boom. Did you hear how Arman killed that discovery call today? Oh my god. Did you see how Jamie crushed his cold call? Like, we're looking for those tape review, Gong call outs, customer reactions. You know, what are the things that we can do qualitatively that show us that we're moving the needle? So if you're looking for quantitative number movement and you're looking for qualitative emotional kind of feedback that's saying, yes. We're making a difference. People are seeing a difference in what we're doing. And, folks, that's part of the reason you do the reinforcement rhythms is you train in week one. And then in weeks two, three, four, you coach, coach, coach, and you will see how people are improving on discovery between weeks two, three, and four. But if you just train in week one and then hope they're getting it in the next three weeks, you're gonna flip the table because in week four, you're gonna watch a call and you'll be like, well, people completely forgot everything we taught them four weeks ago, and that's because you didn't reinforce it every single week. Yep. Alright. Let's recap. One, make sure you don't overload your team. Just make sure that you're not doing so much stuff that nobody can digest everything that you're doing. Two, make sure that you have the right people in the room doing the training. Who the content comes from all matters almost as much as the content itself. Three is make sure that you do more reinforcement than you do training. If you're not reinforcing things, behaviors probably aren't happening. And then lastly is make sure that you have some kind of quantitative or qualitative way to make sure that the training that you've done is getting you the benefits that you hope for. Folks, attached, you will see down below a copy of the rep enablement matrix and example rhythms that you can use to reinforce discovery, forecasting, and other common skill changes you will have in sales. So go take a look at those. Sales managers, no one ever teaches you how to do your job. If you've ever wondered, why are my pipeline reviews useless? Should I actually hire this person or am I gonna have to fire them in three months? Or maybe my forecast is like a finger in the air exercise where I'm totally guessing. Guess what? You're probably a little bit like me and you had to figure out this stuff from scratch. Fortunately, I partnered up with the best sales leader in the game today. His name is Mark Casaglow. He led outreach from 0 to 250,000,000 plus in ARR, and he has graduated eight sales managers who just became VPs. And that is through his three step sales management operating system. There's a special discount code in the comments. I guarantee it will be the best sales management resource you've ever used in your life. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
