## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigilski. And today, we got another big deal champion, a friend of Kyle Coleman, one of the best episodes ever. His name is Anthony Cesario. He's the VP of industries and go to market solutions at Clari, and he was the previous RVP of enterprise sales over at Oracle. Nick, why should people listen? We talk a lot about, like, meetings and discovery, and Anthony gave me some legitimately new stuff. I haven't heard about questions you can ask and ways you can run discovery meetings. He also talked about when you shouldn't be talking about business outcomes and vision with prospects. Three, two, one. The vision. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, Anthony. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Yeah. Let's do it. So three things that, hopefully, you guys walk away with today. First is becoming a student of the company that you're prospecting into or that you're selling into of their career website. Super important. Right? If you think about what what a job posting is, that's a company that's an executive going and getting budget allocated to a headcount to solve a problem. So you go look at let's say you're selling into the sales department. Right? You go look at the VP of sales job they're hiring for. You're gonna see the exact pains that that person has to go solve for. You'll probably see who they report to, and you that's gonna help you establish a really good point of view on their business and and what they're trying to solve for. Love it. What's number two, Anthony? Yeah. Number two, when you get that meeting, right, you had a great point of view and you're getting ready to have that meeting, always send a pre meeting email to all attendees. Don't do it before the meeting. Do it the day before the meeting so they have time to digest it. And, you know, the kind of things that go into that email, right, it's gonna be stuff like setting expectations on timing. You know, how many times have you showed up to a meeting with an executive when you thought it was sixty minutes, they gave you twenty. And it's things like showing them that you have structure and that you're coming with a with a plan and and what you're gonna present and asking them for feedback on the agenda because, that's important as well. Oh, nice. What's number three? Yeah. Three. And this is another kind of component of having great meetings, and it's a concept I call moments that matter. It's how you think about what a successful meeting looks like. So moments that matter is literally writing down what exactly do you want the key person in that meeting to walk away saying, thinking, or feeling when they leave that meeting. If their wife or their husband or their boyfriend were to talk to them after that meeting and say, hey. What was that all about? What do you want them to say? And planning for that, driving the whole meeting around that. So let's start with what happens before the meeting, and then let's get into the actual meeting mechanics. So let's dig in on this pre meeting email. So how does this change when you're having a first discovery call with, I don't know, someone who requested a demo, for example, versus when you're going into that meeting with an exec and seven other people on their team? What do you want the outcome to be? Right? So the outcome might just be on a first meeting. Wow. This guy, Arman, is really, you know, smart. You know, I should spend more time with him. The outcome might be, holy smokes. This company is doing innovative things. Right? So whatever that is, that that's gonna influence the tone and and the content even of that pre meeting email. Right? So if it's a discovery meeting, that might look something like, hey. Really appreciate you offering to share some time. We have thirty minutes together. Typically, in thirty minutes, we can cover x, y, and z. And if you had other thoughts in mind, let me know. And they might come back and say, hey. No. I wanna see a demo. And and then you can you have the opportunity to now set expectations and not miss the mark, right, and say, well, cool. If we were gonna do a demo, we actually need fifty minutes. Do you have fifty minutes? And so it gives you that opportunity to set both of you up for success and and not miss expectations. Whereas, if there's several stakeholders involved and maybe it's your first meeting, like, with the executive team, right, you might be tailoring that a little bit more to the executives. Hey, missus CFO. I know you're signed up for sixty minutes. Can you make the whole sixty minutes? And these are the things that that we thought were gonna be relevant. Wanna make sure we're focusing on time on on topics that that are important to you as well. And so, again, depending on what you're trying to accomplish with that meeting, that might dictate the contact in that email. One of the things that I do is anytime I've got multiple stakeholders on an email is I'll email each person individually and ask them, is there anything in particular you really wanna make sure that we address in the meeting? And frequently what happens is I end up setting multiple other meetings because of that. Because I'll have someone who says, well, I'm kind of interested in the dashboards you're gonna show me, but data security is something I'm way more interested in. And I'll say, okay. Well, then we probably need to set a meeting with our IT director. And so I start to multithread, and I get concurrent next steps on the calendar, and the deals start to move a lot faster. I'm curious, Anthony. What do you do when someone kinda pushes back on you where it's like, you say, hey. Do you still have the sixty minutes? And the COO says, no. You've got ten. How do you respond to something like that? Well, you know, again, I I think one good thing about doing this type of pre meeting, you know, preparation is, one, you're gauging how interested they really are so that that telling you something. And what I tend to do when when someone tells me they only have a little bit of time, I force them to to make a trade off on what on what they wanna cover in that time. Right? So, okay, in ten minutes, we could probably ask you questions about your business to make sure we're we're aligned for the next set of meetings. We could probably give you, like, an overview of of our company and kinda how we've worked with folks like x, y, and z, your competitors, yada yada yada. Or we could give you, like, a really high overview of the product, but it's not gonna be tailored to your business at all. Which of those do you think, you know, would would make the most sense to do in the in ten minutes? Knowing that everyone else is gonna be on for fifty minutes, what would do you think we should start the first ten minutes with? Right? Like, force them to make that hard decision of, like, what they're actually asking me to do. I love that. That's absolutely killer. Because you're giving them perceived control, but you're basically trading value for that extra time that they're giving up. And so if it was in your choice, I'm curious. When you get into that big meeting where you might have multiple stakeholders on it, how do you prefer to run that meeting? Do you wanna start with slides? Do you wanna start with discovery? Do you wanna start with demo? How do you approach that first multithreaded meeting? So I'm a really big believer of pattern interrupt. Right? You know, I'm a student of kinda how our brain works and how the synapses fire. And when the second somebody sees the agenda slide and here's what we heard slide and their brain goes into, okay. I know what's next. Alright. Next is gonna be the problem statement, and then you're gonna, like, give me some some big picture statistics, and then you're gonna, like, show me your logo slide and tell me how you solved it for all these other company. So they check out whether they realize it or not until you get to the demo or whatever they came to see. So, I I think that in any meeting, you should pattern interrupt a little bit. And that's where that moments that matter concept actually comes in. Like, before we even get to the agenda, I might put up a slide that is, like, literally in quotes the three things I want them to walk away saying, thinking, or feeling. And and it might sound something like this. Hey, if you guys are anything like me, you go into one of these demos and, you know, you see a bunch of stuff and you walk away. And if I were to ask you in a week, you probably don't even remember my name and you might not remember anything you saw except for like two or three things. So if we do our jobs well today, here's what I think you should walk away saying, thinking, feeling. And if you don't, we didn't do our jobs well because they're all absolutely true. And it's, oh my gosh, Armand. We need to spend more time with Anthony Cesario. This guy's really sharp. Or it's, holy smokes. Clarity sounds like, you know, they've got a world class sales team. We should, you know, meet those folks or whatever that is. Right? Like, you set that up at the beginning of the meeting, but that's gonna be tailored to what you're trying to accomplish. Right? So that might be like, in real life, that might be something like, we need to get this in front of Larry, Sally, and Joe, right, as a next step. It might be, oh, wow. Can't believe the time to value on this thing. So now you're giving them kind of the foundation for what to look for in the rest of the presentation. And then, you know, then you get into, like, now the pattern's been interrupted. Now they're listening, and it's up to you to go from there. I think it's important to talk about them before you talk about yourself. Right? So, like, from there, it might go into a really strong point of view on their business and a thoughtful dialogue around that. And yeah. So that that's kinda how that would usually kick off. So can I dig in on on those three things that you want people to take away? None of those things were product feature benefit related. You were talking about business outcomes. I think I wrote it down. You said, we need to get this to Sally, Bill, Joe as one of yours, and then the other one was, like, we'd love the time to value. But none of those are really talking about Clari. And so do you have any best practices for what those three big outcomes should be? Yeah. I'm with you, Arman. I think it's always good to think business outcome focused. Right? We at Clari, we think a lot about strategic growth initiatives, and we use that to drive our entire sales process. Right? So when we sell on the sales teams, it's like, hey. What's going on in their business? Well, they're trying to scale up market or they're they're going from, you know, on premise to cloud or they are they brought a new product to market. Right? So one of those takeaways might be if, like, the CROs in the room, it might be, holy smokes. This is gonna help us ramp this new sales team much faster. Right? So, like, there's almost always at least one that's tied to, like, a strategic growth initiative. But sometimes it might be just like a human thing. We want them to, like, feel good about our team and that we're smart and they wanna spend more time with us. It might be something really tactical like, we're too low into the company and we need to get this to their boss. Let's just tell them that we wanna get this to their boss as a takeaway. You set the table for the rest of the meeting. Right? Like, I might get to the point in the meeting where I say, Hey, Arman. This is the part that Nick's really gonna love. Pay attention. Right? Or if you feel like the meeting went well, sometimes you gotta you gotta gauge whether you wanna do this or not, but you can end the meeting with that same slide, right, and say, Let's circle back. Right? So, holy smokes. You know, my sales reps are gonna love this. Check. We all good? Two thumbs up. Cool. Hey. You're ready to go bring Nick into the discussion? No. You're not. Why not? What would, you know, what would Nick have not elected? Or what would you have either seen to, like, say, Nick, you should check this out? So sometimes you have to gauge that, but that that's that's a fun way to end the meeting too. So you talk about this other thing where you're saying, I wanna make sure that I have a point of view on their business. Is that something that's coming right after this, or how does that play into the broader sales meeting? If you're selling something that has any level of complexity, that comes before you even prospect. Right? Like, when I talk about a point of view on the business, right, you know, go back to the career side example. It's digesting everything you can about the business. Right? They're if they're public, they're 10 ks's in your annual statements, they're CEOs, YouTube interviews, all the, you know, fun stuff that I'm sure everyone listening to this already does. But, no, that point of view starts, you know, obviously, as you prospect into the account, and then you validate that point of view and strengthen it as soon as you get in to, you know, get to talk to people. And, you know, and that point of view changes at different levels. Right? You know, if you're talking to the CEO versus the CFO versus some, you know, operations manager, they're They're all gonna have a little bit of a different take on it, and it's up to you to take that and apply it and then figure out how, you know, how that's gonna drive the way you engage with each persona and and how you present in the meetings. So it's important to have a hypothesis on where you think you can be helpful. But at the same time, as you know, in discovery, that can change. You can find other things that could be helpful to them that you weren't expecting in your original point of view. And so let's say I've established point of view on where Clari can be helpful to the CRO of the organization. You're in that call with the CRO today. What are you doing from a discovery standpoint in terms of your questioning to validate or disprove that hypothesis? And then where do you take it from there? So the way that you validate that point of view can come across as, Hey, Arman is really smart and I, like, I wish this guy worked for me, or it could come across as gimmicky. Right? And the thing that comes across as gimmicky often is when you have, like, the stuff that's not pattern interrupt, when it's the what we heard slide and it's regurgitated and it's direct obviously, right from the 10 k, like, if you haven't put any critical thinking into it. So what what I tend to do is, like, I give them, like, just enough to show that I did my homework and set the stage for the conversation, but not enough to, like, go give them a a report on their business. You know? She's the CRO of of this company. You think I need to tell her about her business? No. But I might say, you know, hey. We've been students of your business. You know, saw that you guys are going from on premise to to cloud, you know, and and and it's been really successful over the last two years. You guys are bringing in some new products. Probably really interesting doing cross sell, upsell and with these new products into your current customer base. Saw that you just raised series d. You gotta imagine the new investors are asking you like, hey. Where are you gonna land two, three quarters from now? So, look, this is something fairly common for us. We've seen it at, you know, x, y, and z company. I'm curious. Like, if I were sitting down with you and and the board, what are some of the the things that they're holding you accountable for as you think about the next six, twelve, eighteen months? Like so it's just enough to, like, kinda say, hey. I did my homework. I know what I'm talking about, but I'm not here to tell you about your business. I'm here to ask thoughtful questions. Your point of view should more drive the questions you're asking. It's not there for you to just present your point of view. It's for you to to to use that point of view to influence how you ask questions, what what you show in your product, and everything like that. Perfect. And so from that point on, we've set the agenda upfront. We've proposed three things that they possibly wanna get out of the meeting. We've showed them we've done our research from there. Is there anything else that you're doing in your slide deck, or at that point, are you dropping it and kicking off right into discovery? Typically, the story kinda goes, okay. Great. We've established, you know, what's important to you, what the charter is of the revenue team or whoever, you know, that is that you're selling to. And then we'll typically do some validation at that point that like, Hey. This isn't our first rodeo doing these very specific things. And if your point of view was good going in, this is where you hit a home run because they just told you all this stuff. You didn't tell them. They told you all these things that are important. Yeah. We're trying to accelerate ramp time for reps. We're going from TCV to ACV to ARR and it's really painful where you did forecast better out quarter. Right? They've just told you those things and you've already kinda had that point of view. So now you can pivot and say, Great. Look. We've helped some of the top go to market teams across the globe do this exact thing. And you flick up your slide of, like, customers that have gone through this exact motion. And maybe some quotes are from CEOs or CROs who said, Oh my gosh. I couldn't have done this without Clari. Right? So it's some validation that, like, anything we do from here on out, like, we've done this before. Right? I'm not just, like, a smart guy that did my homework. Clari as a company solves this problem. And then I try not to get into, like, the big, like, product build slides or any of that. Like, I like for us, I like our product to do the talking for us as much as possible. So as little as we need to show about, like, our actual product without, like before we go into, like, a demo. And then, you know, again, then running just a really effective demo. So let's say you're in that, like, initial discovery meeting, and it's just you and Armand with the CRO. And you've talked a little bit about you know, he's do going from the the TCV to ARR model, and he's kind of uncovered some pain. And you know that you can address that pain, but Armand's sort of on the fence about, like, does he move to the demo or not? And you can kinda feel it sometimes when he's like, yeah. You know? Okay. This sounds kind of interesting. How do you get that person to commit to taking the next step, which it sounds like for you would be a demo? I'm a big believer. If you feel that there's some tension, there probably is. I like to get it out there. Right? Like, I might say, hey. Great conversation. Right? You know, I gotta be honest. It sounds like maybe there's some interest, but you might feel like, you know, now's not the right time or, like, I'm not quite ready to see a demo. Am I am I feeling that right? Or, like, what what's your reaction at this point? You know, what would you need? Like, what would you have wanted to hear to, like, take this to the next step? Right? And, again, you gotta do like, delivery is everything. Like, you can sound like a, like, you know, like a cornball if if you just do that like a robot and it feels like it's just you spitting it out because you you knew you were gonna save no matter what. But, like, it's more about being genuine, like, and actually showing a little bit of vulnerability. Like, Wow. You know, I'm not sure there's a fit. I mean, you tell me. What would you think? What would you have liked to have seen? And that usually, like, gets you to whatever the disconnect is. Right? What I've heard a lot with that, you know, Clari's never budgeted for. It's not like, Hey, let me put AI machine learning on top of Salesforce budget sitting somewhere. So they might say like, Honestly, no. The product sounds really cool, but we don't have budget for something like this. And and that's when I now I know what I have to address. Right? I've got a fresh slate to go address the budget concern and tell them, you look, we've never been budgeted for once in the history of of our 350 plus customers. So, like, let's talk about how other companies have approached it. So I wanna dig into that a little bit because I don't think we've actually talked through how to get through the no budget objection. Most of the people listening to the show probably do not sell a CRM and HRIS platform, the essentials. A lot of them sell layered on solutions or modules or things like that, myself included. And so how do you go about spontaneously combusting some budget into the air so that somebody can pay for Clari? Yeah. It's a good question. So I had a sales coach back in the day, a guy named Joe Diliberto. He's really, really great here in the Bay Area. And Joe used to always do this exercise with me when I was, like, a BDR, you know, when I complained about budget problems and I was selling HR software. He'd say, Anthony, let's let's do an exercise. If I told you with a 100% certainty that if you give me $50,000 next week, I could give you a million dollars a week later. Like, we put it in writing contractual. You give me $50 next week. I give you a million a week later. Could you come up with $50? And I was like, Yeah, 25 years old. And I was like, You know, if I knew I could get a million dollars, I could probably find a way to get you $50 next week. I don't like, I would make it happen. And he's like, That's budget. Right? There's never a budget problem. There's a value problem. Right? So I've always kept that in the back of my mind. Right? That, like, if if there's truly a budget problem, it's not a budget problem. It's they don't understand the value or they're not the person that would understand the value. Right? You're typically not high enough. Like, if you're actually impacting the strategic growth initiative and if you know, like, what goes on at the executive, you know, e staff level to deliver on these SDIs, these growth initiatives, it's like hell over high water. People get fired if they don't deliver on these things. So the better you get at being able to articulate how you're actually gonna impact the business, the budget thing starts to, like, come together. So, Anthony, I wanna dig in on that amazing story. One of the the big things that is the separation gap between an SMB to mid market and then the big gap to enterprise is an SMB and mid market. You're selling these, you know, these 20 k, these 50 k contracts. The bigger ones are a 100 k. And you're usually still, at that point, solving technical problems. You're solving process problems. You're not solving a problem for somebody who oversees an org of 5,000. And so I'm wondering if you can talk about from a discovery standpoint, how can mid market and SMB reps get better at driving to business impact so that they can justify what would be an insane $1,500,000 Clari deal? Yeah. It's all it's all relevant. There's kinda I don't know if you guys have ever seen, like, the value pyramid, right, where you have kind of vision at the top and then strategy and then, you know, tactics and then and then, you know, process to deliver those tactics and then, you know, implementation of process. Like, you know, I think being a student of that kind of, like, value pyramid is a really important thing and understanding where the person that you're interacting with sits on that value pyramid. Right? So in a small to midsize business, you know, like, one of the great things that you have going for you is, like, you could probably sell into, like, the CEO of that business. Right? It happens a lot in small for, like, 15 ks deals, like, a CEO is, like, in the meeting. Right? And you might be scared. Like, that might be like, Oh, it's harder because I have to sell to the CEO. I would argue the opposite. The CEO is the one who gets the bigger picture business outcome type stuff. Right? So forget the deal size. That's relevant. It just depends on what you're selling. And what great sellers do, what people who go to president's club do is they can always find a way to to relate what they're selling back to business impact, you know, strategic growth type initiatives, things that are what they're making decisions around for the company for the next twelve to eighteen months, not, you know, the next thirty days. Tactical stuff gets done in thirty days. Right? Like, oh, okay. I need to replace this. I gotta solve this little problem. I gotta do it quickly. But even if you have a tactical product, that's that's the name of the game. Right? How do I tie that to impact at the top of the value pyramid? Well, you gotta understand where the person you're speaking to. When you might speak to people who are at different levels throughout your sales cycle, you've gotta understand where they are. If you show up to a meeting with the CEO and you start talking about, like, tactics and specific clicks and the roles and permissions page, it's like you lose that person instantly. But on the flip side of that, if you go into a meeting with, like, the accounting specialist and you start talking business outcomes and vision, they'll be like, yeah. Yeah. That sounds really nice, but, like, how do I do my job? And so one of the challenges as a seller is you need to calibrate with the other person and understand where they are in terms of the problem that you're solving, and then talk about your solution in the context of that. It's super astute, Nick. Yeah. You can't uplevel on the value pyramid more than probably one level for somebody. Right? But you should be upleveling one level. Right? So let me tell you tell you what I mean by that. So if I'm talking to again, I'll put it in my world. Right? So, like, a sales ops manager, and I wanna know, right, like, how strategic do I get with this person? A sales ops manager is, like, very much in the process and implementation of process world. Right? Like, oh, I gotta make tweaks to Salesforce to do this, this, this, and this. Right? You know, one level above that might be like, okay. What kind of investments in technology are you making to to drive better outcomes for your users on the sales team? Right? Two levels up from that might be, what does the CRO care about, and how do you serve that person's needs? So I I might baseline up a little bit. Right? So, like, I might say, Okay. I'm gonna go up a level in my discovery question. So, like, Hey, when you sit down with the CRO, what are the types of things that, you know, that she's asking you or holding you accountable for over the next, like, six to twelve months? And what I hear from their response will drive where I go next. If they say, Well, look, we're scaling into new markets and we wanna go into the enterprise space. So we're trying to figure out how do we look at the business differently to go into enterprise. I'm like, Okay. Cool. They're strategic. And I'm gonna I'm gonna uplevel them a little bit. I'm gonna put them on the same playing field as maybe even I would on the CRO and make them feel like I'm, you know, I'm I'm upleveling them. If they're like, well, they're asking me, like, can you do better quotes because my reps hate the CPQ system? And then I might say, like, okay. Cool. This person's, like, super tactical, and I gotta be careful here. I might even start figuring out who else I have to bring into the conversation. So, like, you you always wanna go one level up. And I've even seen this done at, like, the the CEO level where this is especially important when you have an executive in the room. The questions you ask show where they should baseline you. Because if you're coming in as, like, a technologist with a a c level executive, they're almost definitely baselining you down towards the bottom of the pyramid, like process, implementation, and process. They're probably not thinking, hey. Nick's, like, this really strategic guy who I can talk to about my business problems. They're probably like, okay. I got invited to this demo, and I gotta see, like, does this fit my needs? So that might that conversation might be, like, similar. Hey, Nick. Typically, when we sit down with CROs, we'll start off, like, with questions about, hey. What is the board asking of you? And we'll hear things like, well, we need to drive a 120% net dollar retention. And as you guys look to scale into the enterprise market, do you have the right team in place? And so you're kinda giving them a little menu of, like, things that you're here and ready to talk about at their level. We gotta move to the final question because we're running out of time here. So final question is this, Anthony. We've talked about a ton of really good things reps can do pre meeting and in meeting to impact their sales process. We gotta talk about a bad habit here. So my question for you is what is one bad habit that you see a lot of sales reps doing that you think they need to cut, stop doing, and it will make their lives easier? Listening. I mean, honestly, I I'm not gonna be like the, hey. You gotta be a great listener. But, like, no. I mean, when you ask a great question, like, actually listening and writing down because you're not like a superhuman. You're not gonna like, write down as they're talking what you're hearing, repeating back to them, Hey. Let me make sure I heard this right. I think I heard you say this, this, and this. And then using that and applying it to actually change your behavior. You know, I think people do a little bit of these things. Right? Like, they might ask good questions. They might take great notes. But, like, how do you actually take that and use it to influence if someone just told you something really important and that doesn't change what you're about to present to them, like, you gotta figure it out. So I I think that's it. Like, people are so rigid in how, like, how they run their meetings and how they run you know, you gotta be you have to be nimble enough, to to take what you heard and actually apply it or do your very best to apply it or use it to, like, call out, you know, later in the meeting or later in the sales cycle, hey. You said this. So that's probably it. Like, I I see sales like, way too many people, like, just have a canned pitch or not that they can't pitch. Like, they show up knowing what they're gonna present, right, like, before the meeting's even done. And I don't care how much prep you did. Like, you're almost definitely gonna get a curveball, and you gotta be ready to be agile. So that that's something that yeah. I I hire for that because I've seen it so much that people aren't flexible enough to to be dynamic and and change what they plan. Like, I I'll literally build that in my interview process to see, like, how do people act react on their feet when when their whole interview prep they did for Anthony got blew up, and and now what? Right? But that that's a big one. Yeah. Just listening and and and pivoting and reacting to what you're hearing. I love it. Well, if you listen to this episode, listen again and write some things down. This has been awesome. Anthony, thank you so much for coming on. Anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? No. Look. Come, if you guys need help with any of this stuff, Clari Clari actually, you know, obviously, has some great technology that that can help with, with a lot of these things. But, now I'll plug you guys. Keep keep doing great work, and, I'd love to be a student of the rest of your guests. Well, I'll I'll plug for you. Everybody go check out Clari. Go fill out a demo request form and just write Anthony's name in the comments. Let him get some attribution. But, Anthony, thanks for coming on, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Anthony Cesario include, number one, the pre meeting agenda. Everything from the timing expectations to the structure of the meeting to asking for feedback on the agenda. Send it to the folks on the meeting beforehand so they have the ability to disagree or buy in or not buy in on that agenda. Number two, whenever you're starting those meetings, you wanna make sure that customers remember the three things that you need them to take away. And don't get caught in the feature weeds here. Make sure they know the three big picture takeaways because they're not gonna remember everything that's gonna come from your meeting. Number three is we have our sales pyramid, our value pyramid. And every time you start a conversation, you're gonna try to ask questions one level up. For example, hey. What does your CRO think about this? How are you trying to help them out? And then lastly, number four, when you're meeting with another executive, a lot of times you can tell by the types of questions somebody will ask if they are above or below the line. And so if you wanna appear as above the line, what you can start to say is, like, hey. Usually, when I'm talking to other CROs, they're looking to deal with x, y, and z related to how they're meeting their board expectations, things that are bigger about the company's vision, how they're gonna miss their revenue targets, things like that as opposed to how many clicks their reps are gonna save. Alrighty, Nick. Those are our four. How can people help us out? I like it when people subscribe to this podcast.
