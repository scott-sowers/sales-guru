## Transcript

Welcome to this thirty minutes to Presidents Club live tactic teardown. If you're not familiar with, the folks who are on the panel, my name's Nick Sigelski. I'm gonna be today's host. I'm the founder of thirty minutes to presidents club, which is the number one sales podcast in the world, actually. My mom always told me not to brag, but there is me bragging. And I am joined by Matt Dixon, who is the author of a number, a number of best selling books, including the Challenger Sale, as well as the Jolt Effect, which is what we're gonna be focusing on today. The Jolt Effect's a really interesting book. You get you guys actually analyzed two and a half million sales calls and actually have a number of insights that we're gonna be talking about as it relates to moving indecisive customers. And then we also have Jen Allen Knuth who, alongside occasionally serving as the cohost of thirty minutes to presidents club with me, is the founder of Demand Gen, twenty over twenty years of sales experience out there in the field, has worked for Challenger, and she's a a wonderful sales expert. So thank you both for joining us today. Folks, as it relates to today's session, I promise you, by the end of today, these are the big three things that you will learn. And if we fail on these, please send me an angry, angry LinkedIn message. Make fun of me all you want. There's gonna be three things that I promise you'll get out of today's session. First, one of the things that I was surprised by when I was preparing for this was, I think, most folks give me a one in the chat if you've ever lost a deal because of no decision. I learned that there are actually two types of no decision losses, and those types of losses are very, very different. So we're gonna spend some time talking about that. Then we're gonna be focusing on the indecision, no decision losses. And we're gonna talk about some of the factors and the reasons that our customers get stuck so that we can do the last piece, which is we're gonna talk about some very, very specific, very concrete ways that you can go get your customers unstuck today with the stuff that you learned in today's session. So that's what we're gonna be covering. Y'all ready for this? Let's do it. We are. Let's do it. Great. Quick aside before I jump into that, I gotta thank today's sponsors. You can see we have a number of them. And when thirty minutes to presidents club sponsors or rather partners with a sponsor, we always make our sponsor work with us to put together a valuable tool or template or guide that you all can use to, get a little bit closer to presidents club. And so if you look in the chat right now, we've got a link to access all of these wonderful guides and templates and tool kits that we've created with today's sponsors. So thank you. Please go support them. They allow us to put on sessions like this. Now with that said, Jen, one of the biggest things that I learned when I was preparing for this session is that there is not just one type of no decision loss. There are actually two types of no decision losses, and they should be thought about and treated a bit differently. And I'm wondering if you can, share some of those learnings with the audience here. Yeah. So for those of you that don't know, Matt and I worked together for about probably ten, eleven years. And before I share this, I wanna make it known that, like, literally anything good I've ever learned about sales has probably come from one of Matt's books. So this is a real From a guy who doesn't do sales. That's ironic. You think real well. So I think, like, I personally if I look back at my career, I have lost so many deals to no decision. For anyone who's like, what are we talking about no decision? It's those deals that are not a no, not a yes. Right? And we keep I used to keep just punting them out quarter by quarter by quarter and being like, maybe next quarter things will be different until my manager would finally be like, it's been two years. Give it up. So no decision is harder than any competitor. Right? Because if someone chooses a competitor, they still make a choice. So if you look at 40 to 60% of the pipeline that you have right now, whatever quarter you're in, is likely to be lost to no decision. The thing that has been traditionally talked about, the thing that I talk a lot about, is, like, part of the time, 44% of the time, that's because the buyer just decides that good is good enough. Like, maybe they were the one to raise their hand and they said, you know, we have a problem we wanna solve. But along the way, over time, they just realized that it it might still be a problem, but I'm okay tolerating it. That's kind of a preference for the status quo. What Matt and his team found after analyzing 2,500,000 sales calls this was not like Matt doing a study in his garage with one other dude. Like, this is a a really meaty analysis, which is why I love Matt's work. What they found was 56% of those no decision losses actually were a result of the customer's inability to make a decision. K? And so if you look at that, it's not that, like, they don't see value in change. It's not that the the pain of same isn't great enough. It's just when they get down to having to make a decision, they are fearful of failure. And this logically makes sense. Like, if you look at our own consumer personal lives, I I think about how long it took me to buy a MacBook. It probably took me months to buy it because I was just overwhelmed with the idea that what if I spend so much money on the wrong thing or if it's a car or whatever the purchase might be. It's just an order of magnitude much higher when you get into a b to b sale. So what Matt found, as you can see here, there's three big drivers that make someone in a prospect role indecisive. So number one is lack of information. So this is where the customer's like, I don't know. I've been learning about this, but I still have some unanswered questions, and I'm just not I don't feel comfortable. I have enough information to make a decision. So that might be like, a sign of that might be, like, they just keep asking for more demos, or do you have any more case studies, or, like, endless requests for information. That's number one. Mhmm. Number two is valuation problems, meaning I actually don't know how to weigh all the different information that I have in making a decision. Like, I've got no shortage of it, but maybe it's like I see something from a competitor, and now all of a sudden, I'm like, oh, I need to see if you can do this. And it's just lots of little moments like that. And then the third one, which personally, a lot of times happened in my deals, was outcome uncertainty. Meaning, I am really worried that I won't look like the case study you keep shoving in my face with, like, a 400% ROI. I am uncertain that this investment is going to yield in the outcome that I want. It's kind of like what I often describe it as is, like, the what if monster. What if I buy this and all the good stuff doesn't happen? So in a nutshell, like, like, a great book summarized in thirty seconds, I'm sure I'm missing a lot, that's kind of the big of it. It's not just we need to get the customer to agree that good is not good enough. It is this whole other behavior around fear of making a wrong decision. So, Matt Yeah. I tried to summarize a really smart book in Gen Speak. What did I miss? What else did you miss about? I to quote to quote the great James Cardwell from old school, that was was perfect, and I have nothing to add. Right? That's a it was that was a really good summary. I agendas, I'd brevity is one of my, not my strong suits. So I let me offer just a couple other, kind of peel back, the layers and the onion here a little bit. The whole reason we actually went to look at this, it was interesting. If if you think about a sale and basically three three acts, a three act play, act one is the customer and their status quo the way they do things today. Act two is get them to agree the status quo is suboptimal and they gotta do something different. That's their statement of intent to change. Act three is they actually change that intent into action. They execute the DocuSign, they sign the agreement. And one of the things that, we found a lot in these sales calls is the there's this thing that happens between intent and action where things start to fall apart on us. The customer starts to relitigate, you know, concerns and objections, things you thought you'd answered a long time ago. And in sales, I think for for our careers, for all the time we've all been in sales, we've always been taught that if that happens to you, if that customer starts to hesitate, the reason is that you haven't conquered the status quo bias, the customer's inherent inertia and laziness, frankly, their lack of desire to change. And so what salespeople do, and this was with remarkable consistency, is they go back and they dial up the FOMO, the fear of missing out, which I'm defining for people my age, not for people your age. But, but, the FOMO, they go back in the photo. How they do it? There's three things that salespeople tend to do. The first thing they do is they go back and try to convince the customer of all the benefits of the solution. Now you're gonna miss out. Remember how much you love the POC, and the demo was amazing, and, like, you guys, your eyes lit up when we did that pilot and all this stuff. And, you know, you're not gonna get those benefits if you don't consummate the sale. The second thing they do if that doesn't work is they try to dial up the FUD and create that burning platform. Right? You know, these problems aren't gonna solve themselves, and, you know, all your competitors are using our solution. You're gonna be left in the dust, and you can't wish these problems away. Trying to create that urgency. You know, they realize can help the customer realize the cost of their inaction. And then the third thing that salespeople do, and we're again, with remarkable consistency, if those two things don't work, is they throw out a 10% discount that's only good this quarter. So and, like, that is the FOMO playbook. And what was surprising to us was that, salespeople do that. Again, this things fall apart between intent and action all the time. And people go back and they they dial up the FOMO, but a huge percentage of that time, it actually backfires on them. We found that 87% of the time, when salespeople do that, especially with customers who are onboard with the need to change Mhmm. You've overcome their indifference, if you will. With those customers, it increases the odds that you will be lost to no decision. It doesn't decrease them. And so that was really puzzling to us. So that's what caused us I think, Nick, back to your your big We didn't even think to look as to why do we end up in this no decision loss column and what are the drivers of that until we found this because it flew in the face of everything, you know, we've talked about for a long time. Jen, you know this. In in Challenger, we talk about challengers are really good at showing the customer the pain of same is worse than the pain of change. And here we find that maybe that doesn't always work. And I think what we really, when you when you unpack this, what you find is that, yeah, FOMO is a really important lever for us to pull with the customer to overcome their indifference. But we've it's not just about dialing up the FOMO, it's about dialing down, what I call the FOMO, the fear of messing up. And it's those things that Jen talked about. It's have I chosen the right configuration? I know I wanna work with your company, but how to work with your company? How many years should the proposal length be? How should we do professional services or not? What integration should we prioritize? Is that what use cases, etcetera? Too much information. Like, I'm really worried about there being a new Gartner magic quadrant that shows that this decision was not such such a great decision after the decision is made. And then the third thing is, this outcome this outcome uncertainty, the fear that I just won't get what I'm paying for or that we won't realize the full benefits of the solution. And those are the three things that your customers really worry about, this FOMU or the not safe for work version is FOMU, but you guys figure out on your own what that sounds like. The last thing I'll tell you guys is this is it's important to recognize this is not just this customer thing. This is like a human nature thing. This stems from something called the omission bias, which is our desire as human beings to avoid being blamed for making mistakes. And that desire to avoid culpability actually overweighs our strong preference to be lazy and just just go with the flow and not change the status quo. And, but they they result in the same thing, which is no decision loss. And so, again, we didn't even think to look until we found that these classic sales tactics didn't always pan out the way that we thought they would. Amazing. And one of the things that I also learned here in preparing for this was there's sort of two no decision factors, which we just talked about. Right? We don't beat the status quo. Meaning, the customer is like, hey. What I have right now, it's actually better than what you pitched, proposed, etcetera. And the first Or it's good enough. Right? Or it's good enough. Correct. We're we didn't make a compelling enough case for them to say, yeah. I'm gonna make the switch. Yeah. But then the other factor here is we might have made a really compelling case, but the customer is stuck. And what you just shared, Matt, is that all of the things that most of us have gotten trained on to beat the status quo, reaffirming the ROI or the cost of an action, giving them, even another demo to show, look. This thing's amazing. All of the things that we've been taught to beat the status quo actually hurt us when the customer is stuck in indecision. Yeah. And so what I learned prepping for this was the first part of our sale early, early on when we meet with the customer and we have our first couple conversations, we shouldn't be running this overcoming indecision playbook because it doesn't really make sense to try to help the customer make a change if we haven't even really given them, or rather, it doesn't make sense to overcome indecision if we haven't given them a reason to make that decision. But then deeper into the sales process, we actually need to dial down on the beating of the status quo effort and dial up our effort as it relates to helping them get unstuck. And so that was one of my big learnings here in terms of how we change the percentage of effort that we give in the conversations we're having with our customers. Yeah. It's it's very well said, Nick. I think the the way I think about this in really simple terms is the first act, or the first battle you gotta fight in sales is overcoming customer indifference towards change. Right? You gotta you gotta help them realize the cost of their inaction. You gotta dial up the FOMO, dial up the FUD. You know, you gotta get them off the fence, right? You gotta get them to wanna change it. By the way, if you don't do that, you're never gonna have an indecision problem. So if that's your problem, you can hang up now and go focus on that first thing. And, by the way, I would tell you, there are lots of great resources. I tend to be partial to challenger. Challenger customer are great resources for that battle to overcome the customer status quo. But I think what we realized in the research is that that was really only half the story because great salespeople have realized, like, there's a time to dial up the FOMO FOMO, right, to overcoming difference, then there's a time to dial down the FOMO and figuratively, because literally this would be creepy, but put your arm around the customer's shoulder and say, it's gonna be okay. Like, you've made a great decision. You've chosen exactly the right configuration for your needs. You've done plenty of research. And by the way, you don't need to because I've already done it for you, and I'm gonna tell you what you can pay attention to and what you should ignore and be a good steward of your time. And then lastly, we've got your back. You're not gonna look like a fool. You're gonna look like a hero here, and trust us. And let's let's go forward together. And, like, that's a very different kind of motion, and I think, unfortunately, and this is the reason that those FOMO tactics, when used with indecisive customers, who, by the way, are not making a decision to save the status quo. Just to be clear, those people want to buy from you, but they can't. They physically can't because they're worried about messing up and what might go wrong. But using those FOMO tactics with those customers who are indecisive and worried about failing, well, really, all you're doing is using scare tactics to sell to somebody who's already afraid. But they're not afraid of the thing you think they're afraid of. They're not afraid of missing out. They're afraid of messing up. And those are two totally different things. Amazing. Folks, let me know in the chat. Write the word jolt for me, j o l t. If any of you have a deal right now where you know they want to buy, you've beaten the status quo, but they're stuck. It's a lot of that going around these days. I see. There's a lot of jolt in there. And someone, got upset at me for talking too long earlier. They said, let the guests talk. And so, Jen, you're I think the guest they may be referring to. I was going to summarize the jolt effect. And, folks, we're gonna get into some specific things you can do for each letter, which is this is the playbook for how to overcome that indecision. But, Jen, could you give me maybe the ninety second summary of the overall jolt effect? And then, folks, let me know if, you're happy that I let the guest talk. Okay. So the cool thing about Jolt is it's very tactical. Like, Challenger, everybody knows I'm like I live and die for Challenger, and it's how I learned how to sell. But this is very much tactical actions you can take. So what we're gonna talk about is, number one, why is it important to judge the level of indecision of the customer, and how do you do that? What are some tactics to do it? Number two, this kinda goes against how I was taught to sell growing up, but it totally makes sense to me now. How do you offer your recommendation with a prescriptive manner that puts the clients' or or prospects' needs first? Number three, how do you limit the exploration? So not be like, don't worry. Just take my word for it. But how do you frame that so someone actually does lean into your recommendation, your experience? And number four, what are some tactics where you can just acknowledge buying anything today is really freaking scary? What are some things you can do to minimize the upfront risk you were asking from your customer prospect? So that's what Matt's gonna share with us. And then I will chime in with examples where I got it really wrong and a couple examples where I somehow managed to get it right. Wait. You've gotten it wrong before, Chad. That's not true. You do a whole webinar of all the stuff I got wrong. Only once in a while. Alright. So let's start with this first one. So the first key to overcoming indecision is to first, j, judge the level of indecision. And this one, I was like, what does it matter? Why do I need to do this? Talk to me about why this matters in the playbook for overcoming indecision, Matt. Yeah. So the the way I want everyone to think about while it's a fun acronym and it says what it does. Right? We're trying to jolt our customers out of their stuck in decisive state. The way I want you to think about this is that it's more of a hub and spoke. So everything starts with the j, but based on what you learn Mhmm. You might go to the l first or the t first or the o and then back to the t, you know. So think of it think of it that way. It's not a one, two, three, four kind of step process. So judging level of indecision, everything starts there because we got we gotta know what we're dealing with. Right? We gotta size the level of indecision. We gotta understand what's driving it. And we actually gotta make tough calls about whether that level of indecision can actually be overcome, or is this a waste of our time? So first thing I would, say, submit to all of you is if you asked a 100 of your customers if they consider themselves to be decisive business people, 100 of those 100 will say they are. The problem is that only 13 of them are telling the truth. So the the data is pretty clear on this. Across two and a half million sales calls, 87% of, the the calls we looked at had customers who were either moderately or highly, indecisive. So that is, sorry. I got some some dog activity here in the background. So they're either moderately or highly indecisive. 13% of them are totally decisive. So if you find one of those 13% of buyers, these are the people who are unencumbered by fear of failure, you should sell them everything right away. But the problem is most people are not. Now here's the real issue is that I think, buyers, don't like talking about fear of failure because that's embarrassing. It's much easier to consider myself a decisive, executive or manager in my company, but you gotta get it on the table in the way you can deal with it. Now in the book, we talk about, screening for indecision in three different dimensions. So the first one is understanding who is this person. Right? And people, are differently decisive or indecisive. Like, we all have that friend who orders last at the restaurant and then tells the white person to come back and then, you know, debates whether they have ordered the right thing, and then they run to the kitchen to change their word. You know? We've all got that front. Right? And and some of us are not like that, but we are all kind of on a continuum of levels of indecision. So we spend a lot of time in the book talking about different personality types and markers of decisiveness. Here's here's one to watch out for, and this is a killer for salespeople. The difference between maximizers and satisficers. So a a maximizer customer is somebody who, insists that or is not happy until you can demonstrate that you are the the fastest, the cheapest, the, you know, generate the highest level of productivity. You've got the the biggest partner ecosystem. You're the highest in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. Like, they are not happy unless you are the best across the board, which, of course, no vendor is the best across the board. A satisficer is a customer who can prioritize. They can say, look. Across the 10 attributes we're looking at, in making this decision, these three are the most important. These other ones, you just have to be good enough, and these other ones over here, we don't really care about. That's a satisficer. If a customer is a maximizer, run, don't walk. Right? Because you'll never convince that customer that you are the best across the board. Second, purchase scenario. So this speaks to, like, is it they're overwhelmed with too many options? There's they're still mired in doing too much all this research, and they wanna become an expert, or they're just worried about the what if monster, as Jen said before. So that's what what about this purchase is making them fearful? And then last is the contextual factors. So it it think about the economy right now. Like, there's a lot of trepidation, that we've just gone through this reckoning in SaaS where, you know, there's there's tons of churn. People are realizing they bought all this, you know, these SaaS products, and a lot of it's not going used. And the CFO came calling, and they just started whacking, c licenses and, you know, churning out vendors and canceling contracts and you name it. I mean, a lot of companies are going through some fairly tight times right now, and so the external context that a customer is living within, within their company, their industry, or just the market in general, can make normally decisive people pretty indecisive. So you gotta think about indecision in those different dimensions. But the most important thing is this. How do you get so recognizing almost everyone is indecisive, 87% of your customers are. There's lots of dimensions of indecision, but customers are embarrassed talking about it. So how do we get it on the table so that it could be dealt with, right, and managed? And so we came up with this technique called pings and echoes. And, by the way, this is not in the books. This is bonus material for everybody. But, we discovered this after we wrote the book because this question came up, for folks. Like, should I ask customers? Like, do you consider yourself decisive? Like, when you Jen, when you go to The Cheesecake Factory, do you leave satisfied because you know what to order or hungry because you got overwhelmed with choice? Like, that is not a great question, and most of your customers will get pretty upset with you for asking or even suggesting that they are not decisive people. But you gotta make it okay to talk about it. So how do we do it? The pings and echoes technique is is borrowed from, submarine warfare. So if you think about a surface ship trying to find a submarine, what it does is it literally sends a ping or a sound out into the water, and then it's trying to generate a reflection back using sonar. So that reflection tells them a lot. It tells them, is it a friendly submarine or enemy submarine? Is it, like, is it actually a submarine or just a whale? Is it heading towards us or away from us? You know, all that that good stuff. We do the same thing in sales. We don't ask open ended questions. What we do is we ping for the source of indecision. So you start with a hypothesis. So for instance, I might say to you, Nick, I might say, look, we've been, Nick, we've been talking for a while. I we've had some great conversations. POC was awesome. The the demos have been great. I think you were excited by what you heard from our reference customers, etcetera. But I kinda feel like, right now, if this is usually at this point in the sale where a lot of my customers struggle with what's the nice to have and what's the need to have. And and I might have made that situation worse by throwing a lot of stuff at you because we're really proud of what we do here, as you can as you can tell. But I'm curious. Do you think you and your team are really clear on what should go in the proposal and what should be left out? Do you know where you wanna start with us? Because I know that could be a hard decision, and I'm just curious if you guys are clear on what, again, what should be and what should be out. Now the reflection I might get back could be something like, you know what? Honestly, we don't know. And as I told you early on, budget is limited. Resources are scarce, and we gotta get this right. And so we can't have it all. So I could use a little bit of guidance. What do companies like ours start with when working with your company? Or they might say, no. We're just we're just polite people. We're nice Midwesterners. We're just being polite. There's a lot of stuff you showed us we have no interest in. So let me just tell you what we're interested in, what we can stop talking about. Or they may say something like, you know what? No. We're pretty clear, but you know what we are a little bit nervous about? Putting that 10 x improvement in sales productivity, that ROI measure into our, proposal of the CFO because I'm not sure we're gonna we we'll screw this up every day of the week and twice on Sunday. There's no way we can promise that. So, again, we gotta get this on the table and not in a way that outs our customer, but makes it okay to talk about this so that we can do something about it. I just wanna compliment you on folks, if you've listened to the way that Matt phrased that introduction of the topic with the prospective customer or the current customer here, he used what's called the customer voice. Meaning, he said, hey. With other folks I've talked to, this is one of the things that sometimes comes up. And that can be a really, really safe way to bring up potentially sticky topics with customers in a way that lets them retain their status, but also shows your own credibility and that, hey. I talk with other folks like you, and this is something that's come up. And that actually gives you an immense amount of credibility and allows them to safely say, yeah. That that is me too. Yeah. Jen, I think That Go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead, Jen. You you had a I think you had a story on this one that you wanted to share. Yeah. My my successes and my failures. So this is one where I think the other behavior that I would sometimes see. So when I was selling sales methodology, like, anyone who's ever sold that, you know, there's a thousand sales methodologies, and lots of people weigh in on those. So one of the other cues I would see is just the buying group would get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, which was a byproduct of people feeling nervous to make a decision without consulting everybody and everybody's mother and everybody's best friend. And so one of the things that I started baking into my sales process was to be able to assess early on, can this group decide and agree on anything at all? Like, anyone who's ever sold into sales and marketing knows there are some departments that just will always take the opposite stance of the other because it is such a bad cross functional like, there's just no cross functional alignment. So, specifically, what I would do is I would come in. I would say, here's where we are in the process. Looks like we're evaluating this methodology and this methodology. Before we get too in the weeds, let's just agree on what are the set of problems that we're looking to solve here. And one of the biggest tells looking back now that I wish I had was when you have an inability to even agree on the problem, good freaking luck getting agreement on the solution. And so our most precious resource is our time. I would try to bake those moments in early when I saw them inviting more and more people in to be able to say, could I even get agreement on a small thing before I ask for a big thing like a purchase decision? Yep. Yep. I I love that, I love that technique. And and, yeah, this is what's also interesting. There's this dimension that Jen brought in around buying committee. So I think sometimes when people read the Jolt Effect and they they hear, you know, podcasts or they they're on webinars like these, I think they sometimes ask a question. Like, this is interesting from a single seller perspective, in a single buyer perspective, but what happens when that person's surrounded by a bunch of other indecisive people? And this is interesting. So this is kind of jolt on, you know, multiple dimensions, meaning you've gotta be able to understand what's making this person sitting across the table from you or on the other end of the Zoom, from you. What is making them indecisive? But remember, you might be able to overcome that, but what happens when they go to the buying committee and their 12 colleagues show up, and they're worried about all kinds of other stuff? And so have you equipped them to overcome the the indecision of the buying committee? So it's a really it's a very important, dimension. By the way, quick forecasting tip. I learned this just the other day. When members of the buying committee join the Zoom and introduce themselves to each other and they don't actually know what they've never met each other, add one month to the, the forecast and one month to the sales cycle. That is the worst. Amazing. So what I'm hearing from this judge piece is there are things that we can look for and we can observe. We can figure out Yep. I can pattern match the person's personality to, okay, do they act like Armond when he goes out to dinner with me, and he keeps waffling back and forth on what he's gonna order. There's other stuff, though, where I can also actually bring this up with the customer. And the way that I heard you do it, Matt, was, hey. Some like, you you use that client voice, and that was really powerful. And then the last big takeaway I've gotten from this section is, Jen, one of the things that you will do to test this is you will aim for problem agreement before you work to get to solution agreement with the customer. And I've heard you talk about this on the thirty minutes to presidents club podcast, Jen, where you actually talked about kicking off a big team meeting with actually a problem agreement discussion before you get into the, hey. Here's how we help. And I'm wondering, could you just give me, like, the sixty second on how you do that? Because I that was one of my favorite things that I've learned from you in sales. And then we'll move to the o, which is offer your recommendation. Yeah. So I think one of the things that's really common, especially with so many different stakeholders in a business vying for the same smaller pool of money, is you might have a general agreement of the problem, but there might be different priority levels of it. So if I'm in customer success, I might care a lot more about retention than my peers over in new logo. So what I try to do in that meeting is they're all going to be affected if they buy a sales methodology, But we have to be aligned on why they are buying it to begin with. So if someone over here in CS believes that retention is the biggest problem, and someone over here in new logo thinks new logo acquisition is the biggest problem, they might fondly fundamentally disagree at face value that they should do sales training. So my job in that meeting is to actually surface that disagreement, get them talking about why they disagree. And in doing so, the hope is that they can actually realize there's more common ground there than they believe, and they can then walk out of that with problem agreement so that when we do get to solution, we're not fighting those battles later stage. Because at that point, it's really hard to objection handle any issue when someone's like, I don't believe this is the right problem to solve. So long t TLDR is make it very easy for your customers to disagree. For one, because of what Matt said, we wanna observe how much disagreement and dysfunction exists. But two, because that's probably gonna be your best way to find common ground versus talking at them and telling them they should agree. I also think it's a great go ahead, Matt, please. Sorry. Sorry, Nick. I was gonna add one thing, before I forget. A question I always get on this is, can is it safe to assume that senior decision makers, economic buyers are more decisive than everybody else? Right? After all, these people get paid the big bucks to, to make those tough calls. And I would tell you that in our research, we found no correlation between level of indecision and seniority or, you know, title or role or function or anything like that. But I will also tell you that senior people are much less likely to cop to it than than people farther down. They don't like it, and they they will get again, if you're not careful, they will get deeply offended at the suggestion that they're indecisive. I think I may have told you guys a story about, doing a dinner where I talked about this research, and there was a CTO from a big manufacturing company there. She actually got up and stormed out, which I think is the the only time that well, the only time I'll admit that people have done that in a dinner I've been out. And, and got really offended at the suggestion that senior executives like her were indecisive. Said, I make the tough calls. I would get fired if I was afraid of making decisions. And I make a 100 tough decisions a day. She left, and, and the account team from this, company told me after everyone had cleared out that she's one of the most indecisive customers I work with. So, again, self awareness is not our forte as human beings and especially not for senior executives. And so you just gotta tread carefully in the, again, the client voice, the contextualization. You're not alone. Lots of people struggle with this. It's kind of the way you you clear the decks, and you make it okay to talk about it. Amazing. So we've made it okay to talk about it. Let's move to our next letter here. So the next letter is o, which is offer your recommendation. And one of the things that I got taught when I was a new salesperson was, hey. You've gotta make sure you ask a lot of great questions to learn what your customer is looking for. Ask them questions, and the more questions you ask about what they want and what they need, the better off you are. And I learned that there's actually some nuance here that might not always work when we're trying to get them to overcome that indecisiveness. So, Matt, talk to me about offer your recommendation and what this one is. Yeah. I mean, I think so this this deals with this challenge of choice overload, too many options. And I think the the social science research on this, any of you read the Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz's book, or listened to his TED talk, is pretty fascinating. It tells us that, you know, we would all say, like, oh, yeah. We love choices as customers. We love, like, endless options. But it turns out that when it comes to making decisions that people make with conviction and that they don't try to, you know, backtrack on, too many options can actually lead to bad outcomes. One of the ones we're talking about here is no decision, but it also leads to things like post purchase regret, customers who second guess the what they bought after the decision was made, and then they try to unwind it, get out of it, and they change it and cancel it and so on and so forth. So but it this doesn't mean that offering options is bad, but it does mean that we gotta know the time and the place to do so. What we found is the best place to offer choice to your customer and options is, at the trade show booth, like, when you're first interacting with the customer and on those first couple calls. And when you're first showing the customer the solution, look, paint the art of the possible. Show them all the integration. Show them all the partner the partner ecosystem. Show them the different use cases. Let a thousand flowers bloom. But as you move forward in the sale, if you want your customer to actually pick something, you gotta chop the field and you have to narrow the consideration set. It is very clear that those customers who are presented with narrower choice sets are are more likely to make a decision, more likely to feel confident about the decision, and less likely to backtrack on the decision and try to undo it. So know the time and the place to offer options and know when to start narrowing things up. Right? The other thing we wanna think about, and this is, to Nick's point, you know, in sales, you know, you were taught the same as as everyone in sales, Nick, which was, you know, it's all about diagnosing the customer's needs. Ask great questions, figure out what they need, and then propose a solution that addresses their needs. After all, the customer is always right. And as salespeople, I think we are always a little bit sheepish around telling the customer what they should buy, because what if they don't like the thing we suggest and they wanna go into now we're at odds with the customer, or maybe the customer thinks less of our expertise if we directed them in a way that they don't agree with. Now what I tell you, though, is to, put that concern aside and remember that your customer actually does want your advice in that moment. They're they're worried about making the wrong choice, and they're looking to you to help guide them to the right decision for their organization. If you think about this, there's a simple metaphor or analogy I've used. But think about the last time you went to an expensive restaurant. You looked at the menu, and it's got all these great entrees. They're all very expensive, and you ask the wait person what they recommend. How helpful would it be if the wait person said, well, what are you in the mood to eat tonight? Like, that's no help at all. Right? It's a total waste of your time to even ask the question. But what do great wait people do? What they do is they say, you know, this is my favorite dish on the menu. It's the one that, like, we sell out of it every night. We still got it. Tonight's a urine lock. But we all of our Yelp reviews, like, most of them reference this dish. It's what we're best known for. But if you're in the mood for something lighter, maybe you want a vegetarian option, I also like this dish. It's a little bit of a sleeper dish on our menu. It's a personal favorite of mine. Love it. But remember, everything we make here is amazing. You really can't go wrong. Something very important happens in that moment, is what psychologists call the delegation effect, which is the burden of making a bad decision, which up to that point is solely on the decider's shoulders, is now shared between the decider and the recommender. So in that scenario, let's say you ordered what the wait person recommended, you didn't like it. Whose fault is that? Well, technically, it's your fault because you ordered it, but it's also kind of their fault because they told you to order it. So that and people feel much better when you share in that burden of making a bad decision. And that's a simple example, but this actually works just as effectively in complex b two b sales, as well. When we can share in that burden of making a bad decision and show the customer, you know, customers like you start here, they get a lot of value out of this configuration or this use case as a starting point with us. Customers feel much, much better and much more confident that they are heading down the right path, and it's not just a choose your own adventure, and they're not sure how it's gonna pan out. Yeah. One really tactical thing that I learned to start doing way too late, I wish I learned earlier, is before you get to this phase with a customer, go back to your call recording software, look for three or four other customers who are similar to them in need state, and then skip forward to the part of the call where they start asking questions about your proposal. And then you can almost come up with, like, a prewired list of chances are this this type of customer, this type of prospect will likely ask me this, so I know to preempt it. So an example would be back when I was selling Challenger, if I had a customer that sold through a channel, I could almost always count on them having the same four pushbacks on the proposal. And so it's it's it's how we frame it upfront to preempt that objection, I think, versus waiting for it to be said and then trying to objection handle it totally changes the the tonality of the conversation and also puts you in the seat where you are more of an advisor than you are just a sales rep fielding every question that hits us in the face. It's such a great technique. I so Ted McKenna, my coauthor on, The Jolt Effect, I calls that a, a prebuttal. It's not a rebuttal. It's but that's it's after the objection comes up. A prebuttal is getting ahead of it. And, you know, it's also interesting, and this will go, we'll get into the l here in a moment, but that is a tremendous way for a seller to demonstrate their credibility and expertise, and it shows I've done this before. I've helped customers just like you navigate through this. I already know what you're thinking before you even articulate it. Right? I'm one step ahead of you is a massive, massive confidence giver. So to recap what I've gotten here, early in the sales process Mhmm. When we first meet the customer or maybe the first couple discussions, that is the time when it's okay to say, hey. You've got a lot of options in front of you. Yep. But as we progress in the sale, we need to recommend the narrowing of options to customer. Hey. I don't think you should do that one. I don't think you should do that one. What I would recommend, mister customer, is we probably should just be looking at these three SKUs, and that's where I would recommend we spend the rest of our time together is making a decision between which of those is the best fit. When we offer this recommendation as opposed to asking them, hey. What do you think? What this does is if you put yourself in the head of the customer, they feel a lot of pressure as it relates to making this decision. They have all the responsibility as it relates to, will I go with a, b, c, or d? And when you say, hey. I actually think we should narrow this. You now share ownership for making that decision. And you mentioned earlier, some people are are afraid that the customer is gonna get mad at them. Like, what if they don't like that one? Well, we're making a recommendation based upon our own best judgment. We're making a recommendation based upon what we've learned about the customer. We're not just saying, oh, yeah. Get that one because I get the most commission. We're saying you should go with that one because of what I've learned about you. And if we believe that our customer should do something, we should tell them. And it's a lot better than them getting mad at themself or failing. If we think something is in the customer's best interest, it is on us to share that with the customer. And that doesn't make you seem salesy and that doesn't make you seem biased. It actually makes you appear as an expert when you say, I've learned this about you. My rec is because of that, you go this direction. Yep. And then the last piece that I got here is sometimes we can make recommendations to go this way or another as a prebuttal. Meaning, if there's an objection you think might exist, we can actually share, hey. You know, I was giving some thought to our last conversation, and on the proposal, you see you have a couple options. I don't even think we should focus on this one over here because it's not built for a team of your size. Might be something that we say. And when we actually say, hey. We shouldn't go this way, or, hey. One of the common concerns somebody has is this. Here's how I might think about it if I were you. It makes things easier for the customer. And I think the big the big issue I see a lot of salespeople have with this one is they they worry that they're gonna appear salesy or super biased because they are biased. They want I want you to buy my product, not that guy over theirs. What advice would Jen, Matt would would you give to a salesperson that has that concern? I even saw, I think deep Deepak put in the chat. He said I sell to family businesses, and I don't see that working. So I think what's interesting is, so we all know you everybody knows when you ask the wait person or we all suspect. Right? And this is actually I think we should go to the l because this actually kind of ties in with what we're talking about here on your question, Nick. Why don't we do that? Why don't we move to the l? Yeah. You're gonna answer I think our our suspicion is that when you look to the other your counterparty, the salesperson, for advice, so you go to the restaurant, you ask, what what wine do they recommend? They're gonna recommend a really expensive bottle. What entree they recommend? They're gonna recommend the market price thing, which you get surprised how much it was when you get the bill. Right? But they're gonna get a bigger tip if they suggest the more expensive thing. And so they're kind of a biased source of, of information there. A lot of this has to do with, overcoming what psychologists call the agency dilemma. Let me maybe let me back up because I think what we're talking about, here in terms of offering choice, works on the offer of the recommendation, also works on this idea of limit the expiration. This remember, this is the problem of the customer doing endless amounts of research. The what's really dangerous about this, this is the customer wants to do endless demos, like Jen said earlier, another reference call, you know, another POC in a different part of their business. They wanna talk to your partners, you name it. It's just endless information consumption. For the average salesperson, that actually feels good. Right? Because it's customers engaged in the purchase process. They're engaged in the learning journey. And better yet, it gives you something to tell your manager at the next pipeline review. Oh, no. No. I got another reference call set up with with these guys. Right? So there's something you could put into the the CRM and something you could tell your manager. But beyond a certain point, customers will start suffering from analysis paralysis, and they think you think they're getting closer to decision, but they're actually moving farther away from a decision. Now the the key here is to understand why they're doing that. And the reason they're doing that is because they don't trust you to tell them what they need to know because of what we just talked about, Nick, or what you were asking about, that they believe you are a biased source of information. They believe you are paid to put one over on them, to hide the dirty laundry, to not be honest with them. So quite literally, the way you combat this, the way you get the customer to stop trying to be an expert and start trusting you as their expert is, first, first, you gotta build up some trust, and then you gotta show you're an expert. So it's not very complicated. But let me explain what we found. So in these sales calls, what we found the high performing sellers will do very early on is be direct and candid with the customer about things that you like you said before, I love that that, phrase, Nick. I don't I don't think this solution is right for you. And, by the way, even better if it's the more expensive version. I I don't think that's gonna work for you. It's not a great spend of money for for a team your size for an organization like you. Or I know you're really excited about this integration, but I gotta be honest with you, it's not really ready for prime time. We're still working out the kinks. Got some early adopters six months from now. It's gonna be a thing of beauty. Right now, it's a little bit choppy. I don't want you to build your whole business case around that. Or based on what you're looking for and we found this lots of examples in this in the the calls. Based on what you're looking for, we're actually not the best vendor for you. I would actually direct you to our competitor. They're way way better at that, and I actually know people over there. Be happy to make an introduction, for you. Those moments are incredibly powerful for customers because it teaches them something very important. You are not there to put one over on them and oversell them. You are there to help them get to a great decision. And at some level, you don't care whether they buy from you, and this is a little bit extreme. You don't care whether they buy from you or from the competitor or they do nothing. As long as that's the right answer for them, your only objective is to help get them to that decision. So you gotta think about picking those spots early on and planning that flag and saying, I am here to be honest with you, and I'm gonna be honest about our product, about what you should do, where you should spend your money, and where you should save your money. Now the other part of do of getting this right, of, trusting you as an expert is you gotta become an expert. You gotta show your expertise. And here's where we see salespeople getting this wrong. This is especially problematic in tech companies or or comp truly complex sales. Salespeople today tend to show up with the clown car of experts on every single sales call. Right? It's the solutions engineer, it's the product person, it's the executive sponsor, it's the customer success manager, it's, you know, the part the representative from the partner. It goes on and on and on. And what the salesperson does is they basically punt to these people, and the conversation goes great. The customer loves talking to the people who are deep on the technical questions that they have. They love that. It's amazing. You're sitting back and you're thinking, let the good times roll. This deal's coming in. This is amazing. They're getting all the information they need, but something really bad is happening to you in that moment, which is you are actively getting delegated down to the person you sound like. If you only sound like a glorified emcee or or a coordinator, that's all the customer is gonna see you as. So what place will you ever have guiding them on what configuration to choose or helping them make a difficult choice when you don't know a heck of a lot more about this than they do? So in some respects, this is about, you know, be conversant enough in your product. You don't have to be a solutions as you're a product person, but you gotta be more knowledgeable than the customer. And you've gotta demonstrate that on call, so be careful with your product partners because they will wanna talk, and they will wanna go, I've done this to Jen on calls. I'm the product guy. Jen is slacking me or texting me, like, shut up. I gotta get to work. You know? But product people love being helpful, and they will go, and it's bad news for you as a salesperson because, again, you've got to be able to take control and be seen as the quarterback in those conversations and have a modicum of expertise yourself. When you do that stuff, the customer suddenly realizes, I don't need to know it all because I'm working with Jen, and Jen is gonna steer me the right way. She's totally honest. She's the honest broker with me, and she knows her stuff. And and when she doesn't, she can find the right people to to get the answers I need. That is the key to getting the customer to stop trying to be an expert and start trusting you as their expert. Very tact like, just very quick example. Like, right now in demand gen, one of the things I work on with customers is helping them with cold email. And cold email means a lot of different things to a lot of people. So when someone comes in in the first conversation to what Matt said, I'm very explicit around what I am not good at. So if someone's like, hey. We wanna rewrite a bunch of cadences. Whether they say it or not, I assume somewhere in their head that might be part of it. So I will lead with, look. When we talk about cold email, there's a place where I'm specialized and a place where where I'm not. If you're looking for someone to rewrite your nurture sequences and things like that, I'm not the best person, but I've got three names of people that I think could do a really good job of that. If you're looking for targeted outreach, that's more my lane. And that opens up honestly, like, it also just creates a safer space where you're not in this issue where you're trying to act like you can do things you can't. It's really easy to tell by the prospect, and then you lose all of the credibility that you've built up up until that point. So I think this is something I see a lot with really great performers. They are very confident and comfortable telling exactly what they can't do because they know that breeds trust. Yep. Amazing. This is, I get asked, I had somebody ask me just a few weeks ago, like, hey. Can we hire you to join some of our sellers on their sales calls? And, like, you know, I'm like, no. No. You don't understand. I just write about this stuff. I don't actually do it. So oh, man. Alright. We gotta get to the last letter. But to recap what I learned on this one, one, you actually build a ton of credibility when you start and preemptively tell the customer the stuff that you are not great at. Because now they're not stressing about looking for what's wrong with your product or your organization. You upfront told them, and they can actually now focus on the areas that you are strong. Two, you build immense credibility when you're not just the rah rah salesperson who everything you do is amazing. Every organization has flaws. Every product has flaws. We've had flaws on this webinar, folks. So it's okay to preemptively own that. You actually build an immense amount of trust. And then the last piece, which actually came from when we were on the last letter, was the pre model idea. If you can anticipate what the customer might have a concern around or a question around and preemptively solve or answer that for them, it shows that you know what you are talking about, and it lowers their stress about, oh, gosh. All of this is on me to figure out, and they feel like they can trust you. We gotta move to the last letter, and we really only have three minutes for it because we've gotta do some outro stuff in a second. So let's move to the last one, which is take risk off the table. Talk to me about this one. Maybe give me the ninety second summary, Matt, and then Yep. Two keys two keys to taking risk off the table or derisking the purchase decision. The first one is early. You gotta manage expectations. Look. We love when the customer inbounds to us and says, I saw that that proof point or that case on your website and the 10 x improvement in sales productivity your software was able to generate for us. Like, if you could do that, like, we're in. Like, I can take that to the CFO. And we love that. We're and we're thinking, if you're excited about that, I'm not gonna talk you out of it. What high performers do though is they will focus on, the old adage, underpromise and over over deliver. So, look, that is certainly possible, but you gotta understand about that that company, and I was a part of that deal. Everything went perfectly smoothly. They resourced it to the hilt. Right? They had no other priorities going on. And we know sometimes that doesn't happen. So here's what I'd recommend. Let's build the business case around a five x improvement in sales productivity. Why? Because we see that a 100% of the time, and that sets you up to overperform. What I don't want to have happen is that you build your business case around 10 x, and we come in at eight, and then you're getting in trouble for having underperformed relative to projections. That's early. Late, as we think about this, we gotta create safety net options for our customers, and there's a whole lot of ways we can do this. I'll give you just a couple of quick examples. Very easy thing of just do it. You should be pulling forward your implementation of your customer success team to talk about the road map from signature to value in doing that before you get the signature. Right? Instill the confidence that you guys have done this before. You know where the land mines and pitfalls are. You know the dos and don'ts, and you are there to get their back and and be ride shotgun with them every step of the way until they get to value. There's other stuff we can do too. We can proactively recommend they buy professional services support. That way, if things slip, we've got the A team lined up, it's already funded, they can step in and get things back on track. Or, here's another great one, suggesting the customer they start smaller than perhaps they want. Right? The customer's eyes sometimes get bigger than their stomachs, and high performers average performers love that because they're thinking, I'm going to Cancun, like, that's gonna be amazing. High performers, though, know that that's sometimes a recipe not just for big buying committees, lots of layers of approval, but also a lot of outcome uncertainty late in the game. This is a big bet the farm purchase when what we could have done is suggested, let's start here in this part of your business in this narrow use case, get some runs on the board, learn how to work each with each other, and then expand from there. Is a deal you're getting done faster, and it's gonna lay the groundwork for a great expansion moving forward? How'd we do? Alright? Jen? That's, like, a fast good time. Your time to give an example. I I don't know how you top that, but I think it's almost like when you feel like you're really hungry and you order a big meal, and then you look at it and you're like, oh, I actually didn't want all that later, that is we can almost anticipate that will be what the customer will think. So I remember back when I was selling, we had this, you know, massive solution. It could have been 6 figure, 7 figure deal. It could have got me to 50% of my goal, and I just kept holding on to, like, nope. I'm selling all or nothing. And it was like a source of pride for me. And what did I get? I got nothing because that ego was overriding reality, which is, especially right now, risk is the biggest threat to our deals. And even if the customer isn't asking for it, it does not serve us poorly to start small and work our way back big. So I think Yep. A lot of times it's our own ego or our desire to book a really big deal that gets in the way of doing it. If we look back to the numbers that we shared in the beginning, 40 to 60% of our deals are being lost to no decision, what, 50 some percent of those are because of indecision, just plan that it's gonna present itself in your deal. Don't hope for the opposite. Amazing. So to recap what I learned from this one, one, similar to what we talked about with the o, we should o underpromise and then end up overdelivering. If we say, hey. I know you saw that case study, but, like, I actually think we should build a business case off of less aggressive results that builds trust, that builds credibility, and it makes the customer feel safer. The other thing is we should be bringing our team in, or we should be explaining how we go from closed one deal to the customer seeing success with our solution. When they have a clear path around, hey. Here's how I'm gonna get to the outcome I want, not just to the signature. And this is where stuff like mutual action plans can be really, really helpful. That helps mitigate risk for the customer. And then other stuff, if we can, start with a POC. If we can, give them an out clause. And, folks, I'm gonna gonna give you an out clause in a second so you can all get to your next meeting on time. But first, thank you, Matt. Thank you, Jen. And I've got a special offer for folks. If you're losing deals because of indecision, it can be helpful to have a really, really fat pipeline to make up for some of those deals. It just we can't get unstuck. And if you didn't know, thirty minutes to presidents club is releasing the book on cold calling this summer. And if you'd like to get early access to that book, we have the introduction ready to give away for free, and we will be giving it to anyone who writes the word book in the chat. So if you'd like that book, write the word book. We will send it to you. And be on the lookout for next session from thirty minutes to presidents club. We've got Arman Farrokh and Katie, Kevin Dorsey, who are gonna be teaching you. This one is designed for sales leaders. We're gonna be teaching you how to run an extremely effective and productive pipeline review, how to tear up 20 deals in sixty minutes. So register for that one. We'll send out the info after the fact. Matt, Jen, thank you both. Where can folks learn more about you? No. Jen, after you. Mine's easy. LinkedIn, I spent all my time on that, and then demandgen.com, Jen with a j, to learn more about what I do. So, also LinkedIn. So her tell me you heard me on, thirty minutes presidents club. Love to be connected with you. And I'm also on LinkedIn, but it doesn't look like I'm on LinkedIn because I don't have the the content and the engagement. I I live vicariously through Jim Allen.
