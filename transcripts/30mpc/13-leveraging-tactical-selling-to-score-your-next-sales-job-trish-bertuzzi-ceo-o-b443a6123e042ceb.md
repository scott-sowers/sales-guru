## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. It is a hiring special here with my co host, Nick Sigelki, and the one and only, Trish Bertuzzi. We're not gonna talk all the prospecting tactics in the world because you can get enough of that from Trish, but we're talking about how to score your next job, especially in this COVID world. Nick, why should people listen? Trish breaks down the best practices for every single stage of a sales job hunt. She talks about defining the companies you wanna work for, standing out from the thousands of other applicants, directing the interview towards where your strengths are, and then closing an interview so that you can get the job. Let's do it. Three, two, one. Get a job. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Trish. Welcome to the show. So let's get your top three actionables for job seekers. Alright. Number one. People are applying for jobs at an unprecedented rate. You have to stand out from the noise, but you might not have the opportunity to do that because your resume is gonna be the first thing that people see. So let's do something different with our resumes. Let's talk about why we're unique and make that the header. Box it out. Sell yourself. Do not send a resume that looks like every other resume out there. Love it. What's number two, Trish? We all sit there when we're job seeking, and we're super reactive. We wait for that post to hit LinkedIn or Indeed or Monster, But that's not how life should be. You should be able to pick the companies you wanna work for and then go after them. Prospect them. You're in sales. Right? So prospect them. So that's tip number two. Pick and prospect. Beautiful. Round us out. What's the last one? If you pick and prospect, why wouldn't you nurture as well? So start developing that relationship with the person at that company that you wanna hire you. Every once in a while, send them an email. Did you see this article? I did. Made me think of you. Wouldn't it be great if I could put it to use at your company? Whatever the case may be. Nurture strategies. Think marketing. So it sounds like what you're recommending folks do is almost put together their account list and then find the contacts at those accounts who they want to reach out to to ask for a job or ask for an interview. So you can think geography in case you wanna go into the office, but you don't have to. Then you wanna think about, what do I wanna sell? Do I wanna sell marketing automation? Do I wanna sell cybersecurity software? Do I wanna sell sales engagement? Pick a category because you wanna be passionate about what you sell and who you sell to. You also wanna think about, okay. Where am I in my career and what are my skill sets? What market do I wanna sell into? So I know I wanna sell in the San Francisco area. Yes or no, depending on the whole remote issue. I know I wanna sell sales engagement platforms. I love selling to the SMB because I love selling to the owner of a company where I don't it's not a committee decision. I'm talking to the guy who can make the so actually think it through to market. There's so many ways you can build that list, and you just need to do it. Do you have any thoughts around the type of company you should be looking at? For example, I knew I was looking at companies from series b to series d because that's a sweet spot of a high growth company. Some people love selling for start ups because they wanna be part of the solution that figures all that stuff out. Some people don't like it. Some people don't wanna go into an existing organization. They wanna be big fish, little pond instead of little fish, big pond. Those are the kinds of things you need to think about. So I'm curious. It sounds like we've identified the accounts. What's the approach that you would recommend, Trish, for actually reaching out to contacts? Well, I think it depends on who you're selling to. Like, obviously, I'm a firm believer. If I'm gonna sell myself, I'm gonna go high. I'm gonna go high and get pushed down. Some people are more comfortable selling bottom up. That doesn't work for me. Especially if I'm selling myself to a company who may not have an open rack, you wanna go high. So it's easy to get contact information, so that's not the hard part. But you have to have a message. You have to go to that person and say, yes. I'm a job seeker, but I'm looking for a company that looks like this. You fit the bill perfectly and personalize. Personalize. And when I say personalized, I don't mean, oh, you like the red sox? I like the red sox too. That is not personalization. People want business related personalization. They wanna know that you understand their business. So relate what you've done in the past, bring it forward until you can help how you can help them solve some business challenges and go with that. And do you go in straightaway asking for the job, or do you go in saying, like, hey. I wanna learn more about you folks even if you're not hiring. I've heard people do it both ways. So you do wanna go with the soft ask. Say, understanding that you are not hiring now, but I know executives like yourself are always looking to fill their candidate pipeline. Would you be open to having a conversation with me? And that's the way you do it is I've seen so many reps when I was in my job hunt sending 80 apps a day and just blind, just blasting the market, and nothing comes back. And you're shocked when COVID nineteen hits and there are 500 resumes in the stack. Right? But you need one conversation to float you to the top. And so what you gotta do is instead of sending out the 80 apps, pick 10 companies and add 10 sales reps at each of those companies with a personalized message and ask them for advice on an introductory call. Say, I wanna sell for you guys, but I'm looking for your perspective because it looks like you've done pretty well. And then at the end of a twenty five minute conversation, you've built some goodwill, and then you can just say, hey. Would you mind floating my resume to the top? You've been here before too, and you know what it's like. I love that, Armand. The LinkedIn piece is really impactful. I've been bolder. Like, I'll literally make a cold call to the VP of sales. So if you're not in a sales job right now, harass your buddy who's got a ZoomInfo subscription, find the VP of sales phone number, and call that person. Here's what you say. Armand, I know you didn't expect me to call you this afternoon. I'm calling you because I want to be a salesperson for Carta. I've got three reasons why I think I'm a really good fit for your sales team. Do you mind if I tell you those three, and then you can tell me if it makes sense for us to have a conversation? Even if you botched the three reasons because you're so nervous, you've earned that person's respect and proved that you'll be willing to pick up the phone. And so when you're having that conversation, how do you typically handle that conversation, come prepared with something to talk about so you set things up on the right foot? You know what market they're in. You know who else is in that market. You know how they rank against everyone else in that market. You've gone to g two Crowd and read their reviews. You've gone to Glassdoor and read their reviews. You've done LinkedIn homework. You've looked at their content. It's not a forty seven hour thing. I'd be shocked if you had to spend more than an hour and a half. So that competitors thing is really interesting because I can go on a g two crowd and kinda get a sense of where somebody stacks up. They're gonna go on Trust Advisor because they're actually Trust Advisor. Okay. So I'm on Trust Advisor. I'm looking at Arman's company Carta because I wanna work there. And I see the the two or three competitors that aren't nearly as good. How do I weave that into the conversation when I'm interviewing with Arman? Am I just dropping, yeah, man. I went on TrustAdvisor and and here's what I saw. Or am I saying, hey. I went on TrustAdvisor and I see here's where you stack up against this competitor. It looks like they're better in this particular space. How has your sales team been managing handling that objection? I'm not sure I'd say you're a big loser compared to your competitors. Here are the gaps. Let's talk about those. But, I mean, I think it would be important to understand. The question I might ask is saying, look. I've done some research. I've read all the reviews. Obviously, every company has challenges. Is there a plan in place to address those that the market's just not familiar with? Because if there is, I'd like to participate and bring it to a fruition or something. If I was gonna go on an interview right now for a sales development role, I would bring here's the playbook I wrote. Here's the messaging and process I wrote while I was there. Here's the content that I've developed. Bring your portfolio of what you're done. And if you haven't done it yet, that's okay too. Don't think that you have to have it, but if you have it, once again, it goes in the unique category. And use video in the process. Why not get your face in front of who you're trying to get in front of? So talk me through that. How do I actually use video? I've had people send me video recaps after they met me saying how much they appreciated the conversation. And I was like, now it's not weird because I've met you before, and I was like, this is how this person's gonna prospect. After they cold call me, they're gonna be sending me a video message. They're gonna be running the triple, the email, the phone, and the LinkedIn. And that was like, that person stood out in my mind. Trish, I wanna rewind to something that you said earlier about the the actual interview. It's the close. It's the next steps. And I've heard some some different schools of thought about how you should end a sales interview, but I think the consensus is you don't end it by saying, well, what do you think? What's the right way to end a sales interview without being too pushy and, like, forcing next steps down their throat while also figuring out where you stand and where you're going in the process? I think you have to ask the standard question, how did I compare to the requirements of the role? And I also like the question, what do you see as logical next steps? Not step, steps because you wanna see the whole picture and not just the next step in the picture. Okay. And so if I ask that question, they say, well, the next thing you're gonna do is you you've just spoken with me, Armand. Now you're gonna speak with Trish who's our CEO. Is there a good way to get intel on what Trish cares about when I go into that interview so that I'm not just going in cold? I would say so. Oh my god. I'm so excited that I'm gonna meet the CEO. What particularly is she going to be asking me about? Like, what are her hot buttons? I wanna make sure I'm fully prepared and engaged for that. And that's how you run a sales cycle too is when you know you're gonna meet with the CFO after you ask the controller, hey. What does the CFO care about? You're always getting one step ahead in the sales cycle. You're driving the sale forward. Trish, we've also talked a little bit about, like, people will come in and they'll start the interview, and they'll say, well, Trish, I'm glad you came in today. Walk me through your resume. And it's the classic first question that starts that. Oftentimes, it begins a ten minute monologue. And so how should reps start that interview? I'm saying I'm more than happy to do that, but there's eight years of experience on this resume. Are there particular areas you want me to focus on? You're pushing back a little and asking for clarification. Like, what are they interested in? Why were you only there for a year and eight months? Because I'm gonna tell you, people are gonna volunteer that up. They're gonna say, well, I went here and then they they got acquired, so I left and I followed my boss over here. Like, who cares about that stuff? I wanna know, like, what did you learn? Too many people try to give their entire resume. And one of the things I like to do is a reversal where I'll even say at the beginning, well, I'm I'm happy to walk you through my resume. The last thing I want you to sit through is a five minute brain dump on everything I've ever done. So how about I give you a thirty second overview of what I think is probably most important to the job, and then you can tell me if there are specific areas you want me to dig into. And so it's literally as short as I sold insurance for two years. I ran a startup for two years. I worked in venture for two years. I came to Carta. Did 225% of my number as an AE. They said, take what you're doing, multiply it across 30 SDRs, and that's the intro. What do you wanna talk about next? Yeah. So what I do is I actually take the conversation, and I steer it in the direction that I know that it needs to go. So your current job or the job that you just left might not be the reason that you are a great fit for the job you're interviewing for right now. It might have been two or three jobs ago. So what I'll usually do is when they say, hey. Can you walk me through your resume? Is my response is, Arman, I'm happy to do that. I think the piece of my experience that's most relevant to being an AE at Carta would be this. And then you point to where you want to take the interview. That helps for two reasons. One, you spend the most amount of time on the piece that's most relevant. Two, I'm not saying you dodge a weak spot, but instead of just spending the entire interview talking about a weak spot, you're talking about your strengths. It's been my technique almost every job I've interviewed for. And one thing that I I'm noticing about your responses, Trish, you're always calibrating a little bit. You're constantly reading the interview. You're asking a question before answering the question, and you're also keeping your responses relatively short. You're not going on these massive, massive monologues where people can't get a word in. Being net net is a lost art. You know what I mean? What does net net mean? Does that mean the, talk to listen ratio is is similar? Just be succinct. I have some dear friends, and this is what I say about them. He never met a sentence he couldn't turn into a paragraph. You just want brevity. Arman, is that something you're seeing a lot in the interviews that you're leading where somebody will ramble and ramble for ten minutes straight on a point that's not really relevant to you? Yeah. Nick, I mean, you'll get a question like, you haven't sold in this industry before. How do you plan to tackle that? And I'll get these crazy ten minute responses that handle every possible thing that could go wrong in the venture space as opposed to the marketing tech space. Right? But in reality, Nick, you need to use the question behind the question. Yeah. It's the idea that you have to understand the information that the interviewer is looking to get by asking that question. Maybe they have a really specific concern about transitioning reps from one space to another. And if you can say, well, I appreciate that question you just asked. I'm curious if you struggled with that in the past on your team. They're then going to respond, and they're going to give you some more context. Now you can be incredibly targeted in the way that you respond and handle that, quote, unquote, objection. There are all the other little things that we've talked about when it comes to perception management. We talked about beforehand getting on that pre call with them, having your resume set up properly, getting the proper lighting done. We didn't dig into this a ton, but a lot of people will say you should bring in your plan to action. Nick, I know you've worked on this a lot yourself, and it's also helped me get jobs. Have you ever seen reps or have you yourself said, hey. When I come in and I'm hired to do this job, here is the thirty, sixty, 90 planner. Here are the 10 things that I'm gonna get done to prove that I'm number one. One of the most critical parts of being successful in sales is your onboarding program. What I think I would find very helpful is if someone came prepared and said, you know what? I've worked at three companies. They all had such different onboarding programs. Here's what I found extremely beneficial. So if I was lucky enough to join your business, these are the kind of things that I'm hoping you could help me with. One of the things that's been really impactful in my past interviews was putting together a plan to action. I called it a seven, fourteen, and thirty day plan of attack. And what I put on there, you can't template this thing. You've actually gotta use your brain, is come up with what are the actions that you personally need to take, not the things your company is gonna give you, but the actions that you personally need to take to get ramped as effectively as possible. So you could put things on there like shadowing reps calls, reviewing competitors' websites, and literally list the competitors that you found on the Internet, looking up the pricing plan and figuring out what leverage you have available to you. So literally brain dump all of the things that you know you need to know to sell, and then put them in a document and show it to your potential boss. It's gonna blow their mind and help you as you onboard. And then you gotta cinch it all together. You gotta close. And there are so many sales interviewers who believe that if you do not close them, it's a huge red flag. And it's as simple as, like, look. Do you mind if I ask you a brutally honest sales question? And the person will always say yes. But, like, well, honestly, I I find that people tend to make their decisions live, and you have a good idea of whether or not I'm gonna be a fit for the job. And so I would really appreciate it if you would share any reservations you have about me as a candidate so I can just address these in open air. And so now that you've closed it up, Trish, when we think about interview follow-up, you talk a lot about staying top of mind for people. How should people be following up afterwards? A recap. Here's why I I think I'm a great fit, not just thank you for your time. Here's why I think I'm a great fit. This is what you said potential next steps look like. When can we move the ball forward or whatever? So many people just sail off into the night. And they're terrified to show any personality. They just do the classic thank you emails. Like, thank you for the time. I am confident in my abilities to succeed in your job. And it's like, come on, folks. Like, recap the conversation. Give them a sales email. Right? Say this is what you told me, and here's why why it resonated with me, and personalize it. You need one job. So you better not be blasting out the emails. Trish, this has been a blast. And, as always, we gotta ask one question at the end. And that one question is, there are a ton of good habits. We've talked about building your target list, which sounds like you're cold calling, but you're job hunting. We talked about getting your resume straight, answering the questions in a non super long fashion, but there are all the bad habits that we gotta break to. And so if there is one thing that every rep needed to stop doing right away, what would that be? People who think their company owes it to them to make them successful are wrong. You own the success of you. If you wanna watch a webinar, watch it. Sign up. You'll get the recording. Watch it on your own time. Read. Books are an awesome digital detox, and there are amazing books on the selling profession out there. Amazing. You have to think of it as a craft. You're never going to know everything about it, So it's constant learning, constant learning, constant learning, and nobody owes that to you. You you owe it to yourself to make that investment. And, by the way, you can go pick up Trish's book, The One, The Only, The Sales Development Playbook. Trish, is there anything else that you wanna leave the audience before we sign off? Listen to these guys. This was so much fun. I learned a lot, and I've been doing this a long time. So make sure you keep tuning in. Alrighty, folks. Everybody stay tuned for a sixty second recap email coming soon. Cheers. Your top four takeaways of this episode include, number one, build your target list of companies just like you would a sales prospect list. Do it by geography, by stage, by market, by product, by deal size, and that's how you decide who you're gonna prospect into, which is number two. Cold prospect directly to people that you're looking to get in touch with in your job fund. Go and add a bunch of sales reps and get referred up in the hiring process. Number three, when you get into that interview, redirect the walk me through your resume question to focus on your strengths and what is relevant for the job. Don't brain dump for ten minutes. And then number four, you gotta close your interviews. You gotta ask for the business. And if you want the cherry on top, you gotta hit them with the plan to action. Nick, how can people help us out? Well, here's the piece where I normally ask our listeners to subscribe, but I don't even want you to do that this week. This week, if you get any value from the show whatsoever, please send it to one of your friends or colleagues and say, hey. I kinda like this podcast. You might like it. You might hate it. Give it a listen. It would help us out a ton. Thanks, guys. See you next week on thirty minutes to President's Club.
