## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club, where we give you no nonsense, no academia or history books, only the most actionable selling tactics every single day from people who actually know how to sell. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. How are you doing, man? I'm doing great, Arman. We got a great show today. Yeah. Today, we've got James Baden. He's a multiple time sales development director. Today, he's at Outbound View, and he's also the host of the Lunch Break podcast, which is another phenomenal sales podcast that you guys should check out. Nick, why should people listen to the episode with James today? James is one of the best prospectors that I've ever spoken with. The gold in this episode is when he talks about the step by step breakdown of a cold call that works literally from how you open that call to how you deliver a value proposition to how you actually close and get a meeting to have a conversation. Really great conversation with James. Fantastic. I took away a ton of stuff that I'm gonna be using in my personal cold call toolkit. So let's get into this one. Three, two, one. Roll the tape. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. James, welcome to the show. We're excited to talk to you, learn about who you are, what you're all about in a second, but we start every episode with three actionable tips. So let's hear your three. Yeah. So the first one would be you can record 15 native LinkedIn video messages with zero call to action strictly as a marketing play to build awareness. You kinda save that for your top prospects. Love it. What's number two? So commit to joining one of the many happy hour Zoom calls going on right now that you see on LinkedIn. Commit to it. Publicly commit to it. Comment on the post. Show up and then contribute to the conversation. Awesome. What's number three, James? So you can say this on your next cold call when somebody picks up. So, hey. My name is James. I'm calling from outbound view. I also know I'm calling completely out of the blue. So before I go any further, do you have thirty seconds for me to share why I called? Oh, that's awesome. That's great. I love that one. I think a lot of people start cold calls way too weak, so we're definitely gonna have to dig into that stuff. So, Nick, what I'm really interested is, James, you have this awesome background working with SDRs and BDRs, and you see the emergence of Vidyard and Drift Video and all these other video platforms. And so could you take us through the step by step, what does it mean to record a native LinkedIn video and when you should use it? Yeah. Absolutely. So the unique thing about and the reason that I called out native LinkedIn video is, traditionally, you could send video messages to people in a LinkedIn message via, like, a Vidyard video and send them a link, and it may pop with a little GIF or whatever, and that was great. Right? It was still a differentiator and stuff like that. But the difference with the native video is you have to go through the mobile app, so you can't do this through the desktop. You go to your mobile app, you pull up the message, you hit the little plus sign, and there's a video button. You record the video. You can record it right there, and then it loads it in, and there's no link. It pops up just like it would in a text message, right, when you send somebody a video and it's playable right there in the message. Right? So nobody has to click on any link or anything like that. It's right there. They can see your face, and it's much more powerful. And you can prerecord videos and load them in through the mobile app to get through that 15. So you could literally record 15 videos in your camera roll and then go to the app and just go to each person and add that video in from your camera roll and send it to them, and it shows up right there in the message thread. So that seems like a really good way to differentiate yourself. One of the things, like, I see all the time with with these video messaging is people holding up a whiteboard, and it says, hey, James. Are you doing something like that on your messages, or do you feel like that makes you look like every other sales rep? I definitely did at one point when I discovered Vidyard. And, yeah, I mean, that was a best practice, I think, and maybe still is. My videos that I send on LinkedIn end up like, the freeze frame ends up me being like well, yeah, like, reaching to to press play or something, and and I think that adds to some of it's just raw. Like, it's me holding my phone. It's not super polished. It's just, hey. I thought about you. I wanted to send you this quick video message, and that's it. Right? I've been running that play for the last couple of weeks, and without fail, you at least get responses like, woah. That was really cool. Thanks Thanks for doing that. Or, you know, it's just a differentiator like you said. Yeah. What was really interesting is that I got one of these after you mentioned this in our prep call. I literally got one in my mail, and I was like, that's so cool. The guy got on. He was like, Arman, you have an awesome profile. I hope you have a terrific day. And he got off. And I was like, what the hell was that? And then he just said, great. Great with great connection with you. And I'm sort of wondering, is this guy ever gonna come back? And so I know he probably wants to sell me something at some point. I'm not going to preempt him selling me something. And so how do you actually turn this into a sale at some point versus just creating soft awareness over time? Yeah. Look. I mean, I think you need to decide and segment the prospects that you're targeting and decide what you want your CTA to be. I'm a big fan of if you have a segment of your ICP that you wanna target, you know, you want business from them now, then make that clear. Right? That first video message should and could be something as clear cut as, hey, Arman. I see you're doing x, y, and z. We help people do that a little bit better. Any chance you'd wanna talk? I mean, the unique thing about that native video aspect is that it makes it so personal that you can be a lot more direct about your intentions, and it actually comes off being way more genuine. Right? Because now the game that we're having to play with LinkedIn messages is like, it's just what you said. Okay. When is this guy gonna strike? What's his tactic? Let's take the guessing game out of, yes. I wanna talk to you about this, this, and this. Is it a good time? I think it's a really interesting one. One thing that's really, really funny about LinkedIn videos, you have the benefit of they can see your body language, they can hear your voice, and they can obviously see any notes that you put in there so they can see the the writing that comes with it. Part of the reason you gotta be so tailored with email is because you only get the writing. Like, the tone doesn't come through. The body language doesn't come through. The fact that I'm not this weird rando and I'm, like, moderately clean-cut and I don't just look like a sleazy salesperson, that stuff doesn't come through. And that's why you have to be so tailored on emails. You don't get that. Do you think it's harder to stand out on email or on a cold call where they're getting a million telemarketer calls? Yeah. I mean, I think the power of a cold call is your ability to pivot and react. Right? You have an immediate reaction to what you're saying, whereas email is not that way. I have an analogy that I always kind of use when I think about cold calling versus email. Email is like phishing. You have a really good lure and a really nice setup, and you spend a lot of time picking the right spot, and you've done your research, right, and you've talked to other people, the fish are biting over here, right, and you got the right everything looks pretty, and then you just go put it in the water. But that's as far as you can really go. You can't make the fish bite. You don't know how they're gonna react when they see it. All you can really do is it's there. It's sent out and it's there. Cold calling to me is like a like spearfishing. Right? Like, taking a spear and jamming it into the river over and over again, and it's much messier. It's much more labor intensive, but you have a much more better chance of, like, actually getting your hands on a fish and walking away with it if once you get them in your grasp, you can keep them on the line and get them out of the water. So it's like on a cold call, you can say, maybe go into it thinking, I'm gonna say this, this, and this, and then very quickly realize I'm better off telling a real quick story about a case study and driving them towards a meeting that way. Right? So I think you have the phone is, to me, always going to be an opportunity to differentiate over email just because you have that ability to pivot real time. So, James, I think you're pretty well known as one of, like, the top prospectors using the phone. Can you talk us through what goes into effectively cold calling? I kinda wanna hear every single piece of this from getting a list ready to build, how you're actually blocking your time if at all, what tactics you're using. Like, you gave us in the beginning what you're actually saying, but can you walk us through your best practices for cold calling that that people can actually rip out and use after listening here? What I experienced as a frontline SDR was that when I would run a campaign, the first four days were always data cleansing. It was always figuring out that most of the information that I had wasn't correct, wrong person, not at the company anymore, bad emails. Right? So it's almost a little bit of a different conversation. Let's assume that you've got that under control. Right? And you've got a list that you've already gone through that either first four days of doing it yourself or you've got a system in place where it's cleansed and you're delivering it to your team that way. So real quick on that. I mean, Arman, I know one of the strategies use all you've always used is you just pick one day a week, and you did an hour block of cleaning out the data, making sure that it was right so that you're not dealing with the distractions during your block. It's insane. And so on day one, you're going and finding the accounts. On day two, and these are the last two hours of the day, you're finding the contacts, the people. You find out that everybody's not working for the company anymore, their phone number's wrong. And then on day three, you finally get to teeing up the emails or the cadences and whatnot. But there is so much manual work, and I honestly, I haven't found a good way around it other than saying, can we outsource this and have somebody else do it? So you talked about the opener going right at the beginning. And so instead of saying, how's your day going, or did I catch you at a bad time? You're saying, hey. I know I'm calling you out of the blue, but before I go further, can I get thirty seconds to tell you why I'm calling? Right? And so what's the psychology behind that? Because there's a little bit of Sandler in there too. Yeah. Absolutely. Look. I think of a the anatomy of a cold call is, like, three different parts. Right? And I think of it like the way we were taught to do creative writing in school. Right? You have an intro. That's a couple of paragraphs, and then you have the body, and then you have the ending. Right? Like, that's how we were taught to write stories. That's the way that I always think about a cold call. Right? So the intro has to be very direct. You can't be ambiguous. You can't confuse people because that puts people off. If I'm reading a story and I can't figure out what the hell it's about within the first couple of sentences or paragraphs, I'm probably not gonna keep reading it. Right? If it's not if it doesn't catch my attention. Right? So that first part, you're being direct. You're not beating around the bush. Right? You're not saying, like, literally, I've been trained before to be, like, just, hey. Like and that's your like, hey. And it's like the idea is that you're creating this tension and you're it's like, no. Just for me, it's always it's always work to just be super direct. Hey. My name is James. I'm calling from ABC company, and I'm also calling completely out of the blue. Before I go any further, I do you have thirty seconds for me to share why I called? And I even make the face. I think making that face and, like, shrugging your shoulders, I know that sounds silly, but when I don't do it, I feel like I get more people that tell me, no. I don't have time. But when I'm, like, using body language to help kind of, you have thirty seconds? Like, that's all I need. I had somebody thank me yesterday for saying that. She was she was like, no. I've, I thought you were somebody else calling in. I'm about I'm on a conference call right now. And I was like, well, that's exactly why I asked that question. And she said, thank you. You can call me tomorrow. The psychology behind it to me is just that you're setting a tone of, I'm gonna be direct here. I'm gonna tell you why I'm calling as quickly as I can, and I respect your time because I'm not barreling into a pitch, which is something that I always struggled with on cold calls. Nick and I go back and forth because we have super different cold calling styles, and Nick loves to use this right off the bat. Right? Isn't this basically what you do, Nick? Yeah. This is really similar to what I say. I I say, hey, James. This is Nick calling with x company. I know you didn't expect me to call you this morning. Do you mind if I take one minute to tell you why I'm calling, and then you can let me know if it makes sense for us to speak? I add that last part. It's kinda similar to what you're doing, James, but I'm, like, again, trying to give them the control. The idea is I'm being a professional and telling you who I am, where I'm calling from. I don't want you to think like I'm the person saying hey the IRS is suing you, like you got to be a professional upfront. I think you're right you need to acknowledge that you are interrupting somebody's day and then give them control. Like, I'll tell you why I'm calling, and you can tell me if it makes sense for us to speak or not because that's a whole goal of a cold call. Right? Is to share the reason that you think you should have a conversation with that person. And then if it's not a fit, it might not be a fit. So, yeah, that's mine. Arman's is, like, completely different. And so when he and I used to work together, like, we would I'd be like, what are you doing? That doesn't work. And he'd be like, fuck. You sound silly. And so part of it is you have to take your own style, and I can't replicate what Armand does, and he probably can't replicate what I do. But the fact that you and I are a little different, James, is good. I think it it's good. Like, you've gotta have your own style with it, but you also gotta test and make sure it actually works. Yeah. A lot of reps are so afraid. They're terrified to show personality in sales. You've got these, like, crazy personalities in on sales floors, and then whatever reason, they pick up the phone and all of a sudden they're shell shocked. And that's the easiest way to lose clout with an exec is they start using the little up tones, which is my biggest tick. If you say, we're a platform for this or we sell this kind of software, that little uptick at the end of your value prop makes you sound like you're 12 years old. Instead, when I pick up the phone, I I do it a little bit differently. I lead with context super hard to get people sitting up because I'm a little bit more of a bulldog sales style. And I say, hey. We work with a number of Andreessen portfolio companies. It's Arman at Carta. Have you heard our name tossed around? And that's my way of going into it and showing my personality, but take some control. Do a little bit of pattern break. If you just jump in and you say, hey. How's your day going? Or did I catch you at a bad time? Great. Let me count the 70 other times that I've heard those types of cold call openers. I mean, a lot of times, people won't even answer, yes. I have thirty seconds. They'll be like, who are you calling from? And this is something that I don't think maybe gets clarified with this particular approach is I've heard people, reps that I've coached use that intro, and then they say, who are you calling from? And they say, yeah. My name is James. I'm calling from ABC company. Do you have thirty seconds for me to share why I called? Uh-uh. No. No. No. No. That thirty seconds isn't really for a yes or no. It's just what are you calling about? Okay. Yeah. Real quick. Thirty seconds. I'm calling from blah blah blah. Like, I'm not gonna ask them again for thirty seconds. I'm only gonna ask that one time. Exactly. And you you've gotta piecemeal the cold call. I think that the cold call is this big hourglass that the sand is constantly spinning down. And every time you handle a good objection or you add a little bit of value, you get a little bit more sand, and, eventually, you gotta cut it off. And way too many reps burn their time or burn the sand by doing a double opener where they'll be like, who who are who is this? And you're like, Armand from Carta? And you sound like the sheep that's about to be slaughtered. You're like, oh, shit. What a foolish person I am to be making this call. So let's get into the actual value prop itself. So you've already said your opener. You've earned the additional thirty seconds. How are you structuring your value prop, and are you pulling in any tailoring into that value prop based on who you're calling? Yeah. So the way that I think about a value prop, there's a million different ways to convey it. Sometimes you maybe do it through a story, through a use case. That's one way that I have seen work. Basically, turn your value proposition to okay. Really quick. I just wanna tell you a story. So we worked with ABC company. The customer service team over there was struggling, and we helped them do x y z. Right? And and so that's you're communicating your value prop via a quick story. I found that to be effective. But, really, for me, it's identifying the key jobs to be done for those people that you're calling. Right? And just tying whatever you're calling for to those jobs to be done. Right? So it's always persona based for me. So it's, hey. The reason for my call today is and sometimes I'll even kind of after you get that permission, it's like, look. The only reason I'm even calling you like this is because we work with people like you at companies like blah blah blah. And how we help them is this piece of software we have, it helps them do this, this, and this a little bit quicker. Does that even sound remotely interesting to you at all? Well, you said something that was kind of interesting and I liked. You were like, the only reason I'm calling you is we work with other VPs of sales, and you're a VP of sales, and we've helped the other ones do x, y, or z, like, with this, does it make sense for us to talk? I think a lot of times when you call somebody out of the blue, the first half of that is almost like a blur for them and because you might make a 100 cold calls in a day. That might be the first call that they ever engage with that week. And so for you, it's a comfortable domain. For them, it might not be. And so, Arman, you talk about this a lot slowing down a little bit. But also a lot of people, even if they've given you permission to tell why you called, their mind is finding a way to get out of that conversation. And I think that's a lot of the reason that sometimes you hear, well, I'm not the right person to have this conversation with. But James, you've sold what you sell dozens of times. And so you know that you do work with VPs of sales, and the VP of sales is the right person for you to be talking to. And so I think you give yourself a little bit of clout's the wrong word. You prove that I do work with other VP of sales, and so you eliminate that objection. Armand, I don't know if your team uses that at all. Yeah. I mean, James, I loved hearing what you said about, hey. When I'm working with other types of people, it typically looks like x. We're huge on I push typically language all the time because I want it to sound like social proofing. Like, I've been here before. I know what your problems are. Typically, when I work with other CFOs or when I work with series a companies, problems start to look like x, y, and z. Is that even moderately relevant for you guys? Right? Versus other people will go in and say, well, the reason for my call is company x is the leading software in this, and then here's 17 features. And let me just hope that you put together pieces. It should never lead a value prop should actually never lead with your solution. It should actually lead with their problem and then your answer to just fixing that problem. Because that leads into a strong ending and a strong call to action, which to me is always, here's what happens next. That's a fantastic phrase to transition into you know, you've gotten some feedback. Okay. So you give them the middle, the pitch. This is what we do. This is how we help. Any of this sound interesting? Yeah. Sounds interesting. Okay. Great. Well, look. I know I'm already a minute over the time that I told you I was gonna take, so here's what happens next. We book a time. You accept the invite, then it's a call to action about next steps. Right? You've confirmed, okay. We seem to have something to talk about. Great. Here's what happens next. We'll set up a time to talk for thirty minutes when I'm not calling you out of the blue. How does later this week or next week sound and get it booked for you right now? Because I think a lot of reps default to growing things into the prospect's court way too much. Right? So it's you go through your pitch and does any of that make sense? Yeah. That makes sense. I mean, we've got some initiatives around that, but, you know, it's not anything, you know, that we're too eager to do right now. Right? Okay. And then a lot I feel like what a lot of reps would do in that scenario would be, like, well, when would be a good time for me to reach back out? The better thing to say would be, yeah. I mean, I hear that a lot. Right? And, typically, on this first call, that's a common response. Sometimes, depending on how it's going, I I will sometimes even throw in, like, I'm not delusional enough to think that I'm calling you at the right moment, and my thing that's important to me is gonna be important to you. You know? Like, the more self deprecating you can get about the situation and the absurdity of the situation, the better. Right? Because then you can pivot that when somebody like, yeah. That sounds it's something we've thought about or it's kinda like you they've kinda in the middle, you say, okay. Yeah. I hear that a lot. Here's what happens next. Right? We can set up a meeting. You can learn a little bit more. And at that point, it's a twenty minute meeting. If you leave that conversation and you decide not to go any further, you've at least learned about x, y, and z. So I'm big. I'm huge on leading to the end of the call with that segue of, like, alright. Well, I'm in control. I'm calling you for a reason because we help people like you in these three areas. If any of that sounds interesting, here's what needs to happen next. It's not a matter of you deciding whether or not to take a meeting. If we could be a relevant partner, this is what goes down. This is how it's going down. I think that mentality is just hugely helpful just even for your morale throughout the session. I love the delusional line. Arman, it's the disarmingly blunt thing you talk about. It's showing your personality. It's being a real person. I'm totally gonna steal that because you're right. The people that you're calling have 500 other things that they're focused on, and whatever solution you're calling about is a part of their job. It's all of your job, but it's a part of theirs. And so I think that's so real to be like, I'm not delusional enough to think that this is the number one thing that you were thinking about right here right now. I'm wondering if it's on your important but not urgent list, and maybe we can talk about it for fifteen minutes at a time that's convenient for you. I feel like we could talk about this forever, but I know we're coming up on our time here. Armand, you wanna get into our final question? Yeah. Let's do it. So, James, this has been a fantastic discussion. We've talked a lot about great habits, but then we are also wholly aware that there are ton of things that sales reps need to stop doing immediately. And so if there was one thing that every single sales rep needs to stop doing today so that they can be more successful, what would that be? Frontline salespeople oftentimes will wait to be instructed and wait to be told this is how we're gonna run this play, which sometimes it's a systematic organizational thing and you can't really do anything about it. I think way too many salespeople wait for things to happen for them instead of going out themselves and experimenting and iterating and trying different things. If I could pick one word that's absolutely synonymous with outbound sales, it's experimentation. And so if you're not experimenting in any form or fashion, you're gonna fall behind really, really quick. I mean, I always tell reps, don't listen to my advice. Don't listen to Nick's advice. Don't listen to James' advice. Take all the different tools out there. Go try them all, and then build your own toolkit because nothing that I do word for word is gonna work for you. So So this has been great, James. Last thing I wanna do is give you a chance to leave the audience with anything left. Anything else you wanna give the audience before we close-up here? You can connect with me on LinkedIn. You can find me pretty easily there, and always happy to talk about anything top of funnel sales related. Fantastic. Love it. Alrighty, folks. This has been a great episode. Please stay tuned for a one minute recap email coming up quick. Alright, everybody. Your top four takeaways here for the episode with James Bond and include the first, which is avoid the double intro. Once you've been given the permission to interact, even if they say, remind me who who is this or what company are you calling from, tell them and then get right into the reason for your call. Don't do the double intro. The second is when you're closing your cold call, don't ask them, what do you think would be a good next step? Say, here's what happens next, and then guide them through the call. The third piece is open your cold calls or use this to disarm people where you say, hey. I'm not delusional enough to think that I'm calling you at the right moment, and the thing that's important to me is top priority for you. And then go into your value prop and ask them if it makes sense or not to move forward. And then the last piece is a value prop should never lead with your solution. It should lead with your customer problems, and then you basically just tell them, hey. We're gonna solve those problems for you. Nick, those are our four takeaways. How can people help us out here?
