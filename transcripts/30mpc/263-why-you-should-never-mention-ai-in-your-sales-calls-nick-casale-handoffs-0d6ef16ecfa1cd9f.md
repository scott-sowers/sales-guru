## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. I'm your host, Nick Sigelski, and I'm joined by my cohost today, Armand Farouk. And today, we have a round two with Nick Casale, who is the CEO over at handoffs.com. Armand, why should people listen? Well, folks, there is a new trend in town. Back in the eighties, it was the fastest printer in the West, and then it was the single source of truth. And today, it's the AI enabled SaaS platform. And if that is how you were talking about your product, Nick Casale is gonna throw your pitch in the trash and explain what you should do instead. A three, a two, a one, don't throw this episode in the trash. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to dock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Nick. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alrighty. Thanks, guys. So my first one is pick up the phone. I think this means I'm officially old because that's my sales advice. But now more than ever, with AI starting to be able to do more and more of sales' job, harder than ever to figure out what is a person, what is the AI. The one thing for sure, full stop, that AI is not doing is picking up the phone, having a genuine authentic conversation with your prospects, with your active deals whenever you can pick up the phone. That's number one. Beautiful. What's number two? Do not say the word AI on a sales call. AI doesn't matter. It doesn't deliver value for your customers. This is basically like trying to pitch that you're a cloud based company. Again, it's infrastructure level. It's how you do what you do. It's not why you do what you do. So focus on the value the AI is delivering. Don't lean on the word AI. Don't say the word AI. Trust me. This will help. Very nice. Round us out. What's number three? And my number three is referral based selling. This is also something that AI can't really do for you today. You can use some awesome platforms out there. Shout out to Cabal to try to make this simpler for you. But if you're not asking for referrals, if you're not creating a consistent process for referrals, I think you're leaving the biggest upside the biggest easy upside ever on the table. And when this starts working, these will close at a crazy high rate for you too. Alrighty, Nick. So I'm a little bit of a grouchy old man when it comes to AI because people tell me AI is gonna automate my job, automate my sales coaching. And then I look at some of these AI tailored emails, and I'm like, that was definitely not written by a human. And so I'm curious. You're much more into this than me. If you look at the different repetitive workflows, things that take up time in a sales day, where do you think that AI shines the most in terms of use cases that are actually close to practical today? I think AI is actually gonna do us all a huge favor. I think it's gonna clear out the reps who are just phoning it in and are sitting on their outreach or their sales loft and clicking start sequence. That can all be automated. I think it's gonna do us a huge favor by getting rid of all of the crap, the work that basically we sit there and we say, like, monkeys because we're doing the same thing over and over. Like, when I started as an SCR, prospecting was just sitting on LinkedIn, trying to find people that were in our ICP, going to another platform and trying to find their email, adding them to Salesforce. Some of that's already been automated a lot, but AI is gonna basically say, hey. Just tell us who you sell to. We'll pull in all the contacts with all the information and personalization points for all of them so that you can then just go about that basically is gonna save you hours and hours and hours of grunt work. So, again, you can focus on selling and doing your job with human intuition, with true human personalization, and actually trying to get to the person on their line to take the meeting, buy your service, whatever it is you're actually trying to do. So one of the things you were telling me and Armand on the preshow was step one, you are doing a analysis of your time to figure out where is Nick spending his time in any given week. And then what you are doing, you are identifying things that can be taken off your plate with either outsourcing or AI automation, etcetera. Before we talk about what you're outsourcing and how, I wanna know, like, how did you actually do your time overview assessment thing? Were you using, like, an Excel doc? How did you actually take stock of where you were spending your time before you chose what you were gonna automate? In terms of auditing your time, I'm not a very organized person. So I'll tell you, oh, I did it, and I'll tell you how you should do it. I did it with a notepad next to my desk. And whenever I felt like something was taking too long, I just made a note of what I was doing and would kinda keep tallies next to it. And then after a couple weeks or so, I was like, okay. Up here is LinkedIn. I'm spending a ton of time doing these five things on LinkedIn. The second one is meeting prep. It's only five, ten minutes each time, but I've got all these meetings. I'd love to automate all this. And so you start to notice patterns even with a really simple sort of methodology. There's actually tools you can do that'll measure it automatically, and you can use Excel. I wouldn't focus a ton of time on how to track. Just try to get a sense and then try to one at a time and start to think about how can I automate this? And is there a way to just take this off my plate where I can focus on where my time is best time? Let's dive deep into one of these. So you mentioned you were doing a million different things on LinkedIn. The amount of times where I've just repetitively clicked the connect button, sent the same first message with a moderate amount of tailoring, did a bubble up after the first message, it's just truly mind numbing to do that level of prospecting. Have you found anything as it pertains to some of your workflows on LinkedIn that were very easy to automate or outsource to another human being that might cost a little bit less than you? Yeah. 100%. So, one, I think Upwork is one of the most underutilized things in sales. You can get any sort of menial task you're doing. You can get done for a couple bucks, honestly. So LinkedIn is probably the biggest one. The other one, like I said, is meeting prep. But what I think is exciting about this is that it is hyper specific to what you're doing, And it that answer is gonna be different for everyone. Those are the two that I think are consistent for everyone in sales. So I wanna ask about LinkedIn. Like, what did you do with LinkedIn to take stuff off your plate? So I'm selling into a new market now other than the one I had been selling into for a really long time. So I honestly just wanted to build up my network to be connected to a lot more people that were in my now ICP. So I just automated I created lists, which take two minutes to actually create the list. The hard work is actually going through in to our modest point, click, click, click. So I just automated the process, which you could do through Upwork. You could have someone, like, log in to your account and do it, or you can do it through a couple other tools. But it's not false. I'm not not reaching out. I'm just automating something that I would do anyway and would take me way longer. But, yeah, you just have them basically do that process of connecting with all the people that you wanna have in your network because we all know it's a lot easier to go in and send those messages when you're already connected to someone than if it's completely cold. And you start to have people notice these chains of mutuals where they're like, okay. And if connected to these other 30 people I know that are CS leaders or whatever it might be, that's a really good sign. Yeah. One thing that I was doing related to the prep itself is a lot of times, I'll find that a seller will say, I cannot automate my call prep. And the reason for that is I need to look around the account. I need to crawl the web for anything that could be interesting. You cannot put all of those things into a table. That is extremely incorrect. I literally put all of my call prep in a table. It was always the name of the company, a description of what they do, the person title and their tenure, and then as many other people in their department as I could find that were at, above, or one level below that person. I would ask a virtual assistant to drop links to all those people's profile links on LinkedIn into that table in addition to their most recent funding history and all that stuff so that 90% of the research was already done upon stepping into my calls. And if I was managing three, four, five calls a day, this would literally take me about an hour to do myself. Instead, what would happen is I would just have someone read my calendar for the next day. And then at the end of the day, I would start to prep for my meetings, and I would open with an 80% done prep doc for every single customer, and then you can do your quick skim once someone has already filled in most of the lines around your prep. I couldn't agree more. But the other thing that it'll free up to do if you can automate public research is you can focus your time on private research. And I think this is a massive opportunity too for any sellers out there, where if you notice that a company is selling you know, let's use Pave Armand where he used to work. Right? It's compensation. If you were going to sell into, say, Reebok and you noticed that someone had already spoken to, say, Nike, you can actually focus your time on going and talking to that AE, right, or you can focus on listening back to those Gong calls or or really understanding, hey, what is behind our walls that I can understand a little bit better and bring to this deal now that I have all of this public information? And once you have have the public information all automated, you'll find these other dots that you can connect. So you can say one of this company's, say, key objectives for 2024 is sustainability. I'm gonna actually Slack the team and say, has anyone talked to anyone about sustainability as a key focus? How did you take that conversation? What worked and what didn't? And you can focus again on what AI can't do, which is having conversations within your team and understanding sort of that collective knowledge that you have internally that no one else can find on the web, not your competitors, not other sellers, etcetera. And when you compound the two, I think is when you can hit a home run. So I wanna transition to one of the other things we were talking about in the preshow where you were telling us about how impactful referral based selling has been for you. Mhmm. And it's been something that I've personally leaned on pretty hard here when I sell it thirty minutes to presidents club. And I'm curious if you can talk to me about what your referral selling approach looks like, Nick. I mean, I think of it in three buckets. I think there's referral based prospecting, there's a referral based selling, and then there's referral based closing. You should have a consistent process for how you leverage all three of them. Again, I give Kabbal a shout out. It's the only tool I know of that really does this, honestly, and and I'm a mega user. But referral based prospecting, effectively, is finding that wider web of connections so that you can basically say, hey. Look. Beyond my network, who within our business or who that is a advocate of our company is connected to someone that I'd like to sell to? And this is something, again, that you could think about outsourcing through Upwork if you wanted to, or you could use a platform to do it. There are ways to do this that will save you a ton of time. But go one layer beyond just who you're connected to and ask, who is my CEO? Who is my VP of sales? My CRO, my VP of engineering, the leader of my company, my investors, who are they connected to where I can make a soft ask and say, hey. Can you make a warm intro? 100%. That's something where you're asking a huge favor, of course. But when your VC, VP of sales picks up the phone and asks someone to take a meeting, again, they know that's not AI. That's a 100% human interaction that's gonna have an incredibly high hit rate for you. So that's one. And I would do that also throughout the sales process, continue to try to multicare through this. But I would also if you're already selling the deal, I would try to understand who that person is connected to that you've sold before. Or I would say, hey, Nick. You just mentioned two things, actually, that are jogging my memory from a conversation I had with Sarah over at Google. Do you know Sarah? And almost imply that they should if they don't already. What I would not do here is don't make it about your product. And this is key. This is just you two are peers, and it has to be authentic. But start to train your brain to think this way, And you'll start to find these patterns when you're on calls, even if you have to force it at first. Do you know, Sarah yet? What you just said reminds me 100% of a conversation I had with Sarah two weeks ago. Actually, if you're up for it, she loves connecting with other people in the space. I think you two should chat. And if you do this really well, it's a value add for absolutely everyone involved. Because who doesn't wanna also connect with someone who is like minded? They can both level up through that conversation. And by the way, obviously, you're doing it because you know Sarah is a huge fan of what you're selling. And you know it's like, Nick said we should talk? Oh, yeah. We love them over there. So this one, I think, is huge. This is the point that I've been running a ton also, Ned. Like, when I have deals where, okay, I don't have a meeting for another ten days, I'm always thinking about what can I do to juice the deal right now? And one of my favorite plays is looking at the VP of marketing's mutual connections that I have with them and being like, oh, cool. They're connected to this customer here. I'm texting my customer and being like, hey. I'm talking to Armand. Would you please go put in a good word for us? And they'll get on the phone. And the next time I meet with that VP, the tenor of that meeting is totally different. And it's kind of nice. You almost have, like, a Salesforce of your own customers selling for you. My question for you is, I understand the, okay, it should add value for everybody involved. But there's a certain point where I'm like, if I'm a customer, there's only so many coffee chats that I wanna get on with people in my space before I'm like, yo. You keep having me sell all your deals for you. Please stop. Are you doing anything special to, like, not burn your customers out or get them willing to advocate for you again and again and again, or is it just you're far more likable than me? It takes a certain amount of time because you do have to start to build up sort of that Rolodex of, hey. I've sold x number of accounts. I've worked with x number of people. And I think if you're doing it in a way that's genuine, you don't fall into that trap everyone falls into of, like, there's one reference customer we're all just harassing. Don't go harass them to do some huge formal case study for your business because those are a ton of work, but just have it be someone where you do try to genuinely build up. Like, again, you can't force these. It has to be something that's genuine, but I think people just don't even have the motion to do it. But maintain relationships with your customers. All this stuff compounds. It's all the best practices from sales. Like, if you don't email people, just email them. Email them when there's content you think is relevant for them. Email them when there's a new product release, what you're excited about the product release, and how that's gonna help them even if you sold them six months ago and you have no upside on that. Like, do things genuinely to nurture the relationship. And then you're not asking so much for a favor. You're just saying, hey. I think you too would have a really interesting chat. And you're not making it about your product. You know that's inherently gonna be a net benefit, but you're not making it about your product. And this was something that I think our team was really good at this early on at Sendoso because we were really championing a new category. And you start to really understand who buys into what you're doing. And a lot of times, if it's if you're an early stage company as well, everyone who is interested in your product is in a similar sort of cohort on the technology adoption spectrum. And so they have a lot in common in a lot of other ways too. And I think you'll start to see a little bit of a flywheel with this if you do it right. That is an extremely intelligent point because I'm thinking about our own customers where most of our sponsors are sales tech companies who are first dipping their toe into what you might call, like, podcast advertising or influencer marketing, which some folks consider advertising with 30 MPC. And when I set up a marketer with a referral, oftentimes, the conversation is less about 30 MPC and more about the broader strategy of how these companies are marketing to their buyers. You folks listening to this episode are their buyers. And the referral conversation is less about 30 MPC and more about that. And you're right. You get folks now exchanging best practices that aren't always about the product, but that is where it gets really, really, really valuable. And I think too, the more you can, don't frame it as a referral because it's really not. I think everyone feels pretty isolated. And the idea of talking to someone who's doing the job you are doing and understanding how they're doing it, what's going well, what's not going well, is always a valuable conversation. You're being a connector of people. I'm not phenomenal at that. But if you start to build the muscle of doing it within your sales conversations, and then you'll start to see the payoff where these people do actually maybe they become friends, maybe they hang out, then you start to build up this reputation of, hey, everyone they're connecting with has something super, super interesting. I always learn something on those conversations. So I wanna go back to the concept of mid deal referrals, which is something that both of you guys referenced a little bit earlier on. So let's pretend that you're working with one of your old reps on your team. And one of your reps is working a deal with a champion, and you happen to know the CEO on the account. What do you do with that referral? Do you meet with the CEO while your rep continues to meet with the champion? Do you introduce the CEO to your rep and sort of keep the champion in the separate world? Like how do you manage that referral to someone higher in the process without stepping on the toes of your champion? Yeah. I think this is called a lighthouse email, but you just let them know that you're there and then you kind of are going to keep them posted along the way. This tends to be counterintuitive, but generally, it depends on what size the company is. But usually the CEO is gonna be like, you're in the right place. So what you don't wanna do is ask the CEO to basically jump in the boat with you. So what you wanna do is just be like, hey. Matt, it was awesome to hear a company name come up today. I've got either so and so on my team or I'm working with x, y, and z. They've been awesome, by the way. Again, just as great to hear your name come up. I'll keep you posted as we go through. But if you end up having any questions, feel free to reach out or jump on one of our calls. I think you don't want to leapfrog in that scenario. And, again, it completely depends on how the deal is going and a lot of other things. But I think you just wanna, like, raise your hand and and make it known that you're there. You also can very easily, on a conversation with the person, just let god actually know math. Your CEO is a friend of mine or I sold him at a past company or whatever. You wanna want to give everyone the impression that, you know, hey, look, I know I'm in the right place right now and I'm going to stay here. But if anything comes up, feel free to join us. So, Nick, I want to go all the way back to one of the actionable takeaways that you had where you were talking about how if I say, yeah, and my solution is powered by AI. Let me tell you about that. It's probably hurting you more than it helps because you're not talking about the value of AI. You're talking about the underlying architecture, which isn't really the value. And I'm wondering if you could expand on that topic a bit. Yeah. I think if you're telling and you use the word AI as part of your pitch or part of your value prop, is a fundamental misunderstanding of how people make decisions. But the same thing goes for all the companies right now that just have AI spattered across their homepage or their website. There is no inherent value in AI. There is value in what it allows you to do. One of the best ways I heard this expressed was a CEO or heard speak loud. Actually, CEO of Ironclad. He was talking about how they kept getting questions about if they were gonna have AI in their product, and this was, like, eight years ago, so it was before everyone had AI. And he told his team, look. If people ask about AI, ask them what they want to do, and they'll realize they don't need AI for it. They need our products for it on our feature set. But focus on what they wanna do. Now I'll give you an example. He said, a self driving car does not have any value. There's no value in a car with AI or the car that self driving. The value is, would you like to be able to work while you commute to work? I mean, look. For all you know, that person loves driving their car, and you just spent all this time talking about this. So, again, focus on what allows your customers to do, and I think you're gonna come off as a breath of fresh air in the sales process where everyone is focusing on AI. Again, like you said, Nick, no one is talking about, oh, you know, this is cloud based, so you don't have to download the software and refresh the software because that's table stakes. This is going to happen with AI 100%. I'll bet you any amount of money right now. Salesforce is out there talking about how there's Einstein with AI blah blah. This is all gonna come and go so quickly. No one is gonna be using the word AI in marketing and in sales, And everyone, it's just gonna be table stakes. It's gonna be underlying yada yada. And no one in a buying room, I promise you, is sitting there looking at a true business value proposal from two vendors with ROI and going, okay. What are these two gonna allow us to do? But this one uses AI. And so I think I'm leaning that direction even though this other one is gonna solve problems a, b, and c for us. That's not a conversation that's happening. No one is doing that. What people want, and a lot of people are expressing this externally as, okay. We're gonna use AI to give our SDRs back three hours a day and not have to prospect. That's what they want. They want the time back for the SDRs. They actually don't care how they get it. They're externalizing that if they think we can do it with AI. But, actually, if you had a way better way of doing it that didn't use any AI, they'd happily use that, and they'd happily pay you for it. So I think that we're all parroting a lot of messaging that we're hearing from our marketing team, our enablement team, or the Internet, or our product team because we still don't understand it. And we're on there with a call, and we're like, hey. Arman. Great news. Our podcast uses AI. Okay. How's that gonna make my job any easier? Right? It doesn't. I would really try to force yourself on sales calls not to even use the word AI. Your responsibility as a salesperson is to take all of the inputs and information that you get from your product team, your marketing team, your leadership, which are often going to come in the form of, oh, we just added AI to do this, and translate that to your buyer in terms of this is the problem that we are now solving for you. And all of your language should be translated and adapted for that. Hey. You feel like you're working too much now when you're on your commute to work? You can clear out your inbox because you have a self driving car. It's not the self driving car that it is a value. It is the problem that is getting solved that has value. I know that salespeople listening to this are going to stumble up against unsophisticated buyers who are going to ask them somewhat silly questions like, well, does this platform have AI in it? Or if not that, some other silly question that's like, clearly, the buyer doesn't really know what they're asking. And how do I respond to that sort of dumb question in an artful way without making my buyer look bad in front of their group maybe during a demo? At the trap right there, Nick. Because as you know, if someone asks a question like that, you have to respond with a question. Right? AI. Mhmm. Topic of the minute. Glad you brought it up. Curious. Is it something that you're looking for in a solution? Curious. What makes you bring that up? Right? You could get a range of answers from, I'm horrified of AI, and I don't wanna use it, and that's gonna make you go one direction. It's very important to my VP that we use something with AI. That's fascinating. What's making your VP say that? And if you ask the right questions, you'll understand really what they're asking for, which is probably some level of someone figured out that if we have something with AI, we will get this value with a higher degree of consistency or whatever it might be. But no one's looking for AI. It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't do anything. No one wants AI. They want time back. They want a higher degree of quality when they're trying to search for answers. They want it easier to get information from their database in plain English. They want it easier to semantically search a large dataset. Like, the actual value they're looking for has nothing to do with AI or anything you're doing from an infrastructure standpoint, frankly. Yeah. Just to round this one out, this reminds me a lot of any sort of feature request that seems to come out of left field from a prospect. When I was selling at Pave, it was a compensation solution. And oftentimes, performance is attached to compensation changes. And so people would always ask, do you integrate with the major performance systems like Alattice, like an insert other performance system here. And I would see a lot of the junior sellers start to sweat because they'd be like, shoot. I know we don't integrate with Lattice. This is really, really bad. And our savvy sales engineers or if a senior rep was on the call would always just ask, interesting. I haven't heard that request super often. I'm curious. What were you hoping to do with them? And, inevitably, what they would say is, oh, I wanna pull in the performance information, which all lives in their HR system, which we do integrate with. And so anytime you get a random feature request, what a prospect is doing is they're trying to piece together in their head how two systems might technically work together or what they think they need in a feature to do a job. And it's your job to figure out what the job is that they want to do and show them the right way to do it, whether or not that is with AI. And you can end up dismantling some competitive arguments there too if a lazy seller from a competitor was like, oh, and we have AI. And then the buyer gets on with you, and they're like, oh, okay. This you know, I'll write that in my little software evaluation checklist. This one has AI. Great. Let me get on with Nick. Hey, Nick. Do you guys use AI? Well, why do you want AI? Well, I'm not sure I do need AI. Well, let me let's talk about what you do wanna do in Gutterable Platform. Then all of a sudden, you're gonna get a check-in all the other columns where they actually need to solve problems and they're gonna go, okay. Well, I think we know what we need here. Right? The first one uses AI. We spent the whole time talking about AI, but I actually don't really understand what business problems it's gonna solve for us. You're so right. This reminds me of the first time you came on the show where you teach your customer the evaluation criteria, and you can almost, like, landmine your customer where it's like, hey. Competitor a over there, they're a fine company. They do good work. They've just built their business differently. They've been very focused on this mysterious AI solution. We actually solve all this stuff over here. And so if AI is so so important to you, you go over there. But if you actually care about a, b, c, d, e, and f, we're probably the better fit. So if you haven't listened to the next first episode on the show, I highly, highly recommend it. Nick, we're running out of time, and we gotta move ourselves to the final question. And so the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things that salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? I'm gonna has to repeat from the first time I was on the show because it's genuinely still my one that grinds my gears. Purate who you follow on LinkedIn, on Twitter, whatever, and really try to be thoughtful about where you take advice. Thirty MPC is an awesome place to get advice. There's a lot of other great sales content out there. Be really thoughtful about this. Do not and LinkedIn will do this. They'll shove someone you don't follow right into your face just because they got a lot of likes and comments. There is so much bad advice on the Internet. Please, please, please be thoughtful about who you take advice from. Boom. Beautiful. Nick, thank you for joining us again. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode with Nick Casale. Number one, do not neglect internal research when you're preparing for a sales call. There's all sorts of external information that you're able to find when you're prepping for a call, LinkedIn information, your prospect's website, etcetera. But you should also be looking at, hey. Have we talked to this company before? If so, can I talk to the AE who spoke with them? Can I see what other interaction we've had with them? Number two, prep for your sales calls by understanding lookalike conversations. So if I have a meeting with Nike, I'm gonna go find my colleagues who met with Adidas and Puma and figure out what those folks cared about, and that will inform my perspective to run a much more effective sales call. Number three, the lighthouse email. If you have a referral to someone at the top and you want to engage them mid deal cycle, don't just rope them into the boat. Instead, let them know that the boat is there. Let them know that you're selling and you're working with their awesome champion so that they say, hey. You're in the right place. And then lastly, number four, don't say AI in your sales calls. Instead, focus on the problem they wanna solve. What do they want to do? And you can use this to dismantle AI enabled competitors or any competitor that that is trying to beat you feature for feature. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Well, folks, believe it or not, Armand takes notes during these 30 MPC recordings, and he sometimes is generous enough to email out all of the sales tips that he's learned from thirty minutes to presidents club in a weekly 30 MPC newsletter. And if you're not horribly, utterly disgusted by the idea of getting an occasional email from Armand, I might recommend that you check out the show notes to subscribe to that 30 MPC newsletter. Thanks for listening, folks. We'll see you next week on the show.
