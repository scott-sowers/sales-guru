## Transcript

Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. Again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning.

It has everything to do with grit to see if you can make it through this and still be willing to stay in the world of sales. Because when you get out of college and you haven't been exposed to cold calling or whatever it is, and that's one of your first jobs, like a vast majority of reps blast about a month and they're like, yo, this. And I do think that it's actually necessary these days for reps getting out of college to just to be in a bullpen, by the way, be in the office so that you can pick up through osmosis and everything like that. Sorry, kids. Like first two, three years, the amount of learning that I did in those first two, three years, because I was in the office, I never got good training. The most training was terrible, but I was able to pick up on the kid next to me who was making that call. And I love the way he did the intro. The VP of sales would pop in the cube next to me and start talking about a deal. And I'd kind of learn just by being there. What I'm worried about right now is with the lack of grit, but also this remote world and the automation with all the AI that is getting him away from what sales is really all about and how it is hard, but it's insanely rewarding. And if you have that skill, you can transfer that for the rest of your life. So are you seeing a reluctance to cold call from from a generational standpoint, or do you think it's just in general things are down and everybody's down on cold calling? It's increasingly become a less common activity to cold call across sales floor. And I think this was exacerbated by the the ZERP era of everyone could hit quota off of inbound, and everyone was making 300 k o t e's and 400 k paydays off of inbound deals. And you could sneeze 17 times, turn your Zoom off, and say I need to go to the bathroom in the middle of a sales call, and you would still close the deals. And what's really, really fascinating is this thing is coming full circle where to your point, because it's so easy to do mass scale email automation, there are oftentimes these new age sales teams that are actually automating all of the email marketing for their sales teams. And you know what they have their SDRs doing? They're having them rip the phones all day because because that's the thing that the human can still do. Yeah. And so it's actually becoming a nondifferentiator anymore to be able to send emails, and it's not becoming easy to hit quota anymore. And so it's actually starting to force some people back to the phones because in order to hit quota, you have to beat the average. And, fundamentally, if every other average rep is sending the same emails, you can't beat quota because you can't beat the average. And so you're seeing this reemergence of people going back to the phones because prospects' inboxes are flooded with 10,000 emails a day, and it's one of the few things that you can do to stand back out. Yeah. I'm gonna be straight up honest with you guys right now. I embarrassed myself the other day. I still cold call every once in a while, but what's that product that does the cold call role play thing? Have you seen that? I've seen some of them. There's a couple different ones. Yeah. So there's like a contest that was going on. Oh, you know, whoever can get the highest score. So I'm sitting there chilling, and I picked the hardest one. I clicked that thing and it worked me like that. I was just like, oh my God. I'm like, Hey, thanks for taking my call. It's like, who the hell is that? I'm like, you know, I'm like a value, like I don't need that credit. And I was, oh my God, you hung up on me. My score was like mid sixties. It was, you know, supposed to be in the nineties. I'm like, delete. I don't need anybody to see that. But I just I still think it's important. So, Nick, talk to me about why you think cold call is still valid. And then I wanna I wanna hear your perspective on this. We'll sometimes post things on our on our podcast or on YouTube. And every single time we post about cold calling, you get someone out there who's saying, oh, this is great advice, but cold calling doesn't work anymore. It's dead. You're better off doing this, this, or this. And more often than not, pretty much all the time, the people who are making those comments are either mediocre, bottom middle performer reps, or somebody selling some social selling email automation BS tool. The reality is cold calling is a bad use of your time if you are not good at it. The average cold caller, so right at the 50 percentile, doesn't really do all that well. If they made 800 dials over the course of a month, which is generally an hour or so of calling a day, that person ends up booking something like two meetings out of all of those dials. That's not a good use of your time. Not at all. As soon as you go from the fiftieth percentile to the seventy fifth percentile, the results are dramatically different. For the top reps, here's how those numbers change. You book 18 meetings on those 800 dials. What does it take to do 800 dials? It's one hour of cold calling, five days a week. You're telling me that you can find another way to book 18 meetings in a month for one hour of work per day? There is no other way. On top of that, cold calling, even if you suck at it, doubles your email reply rate because your cold calls draw attention to your emails. And you're already researching the accounts, folks. You might as well spend one hour a day cold calling them. You just don't like it. Because that makes a ton of sense. Like, I do tests with my clients of sequences. Right? Well, we'll do a persona driven sequence. Call it 10 touches in a sequence. Then we we split test it and it's just email. No phone, nothing. And then we do the same exact sequence to the same exact personas and add phone has touched two, five and eight. We get a 10% bump in the overall conversion ratio. So So I keep telling reps, it's almost like it's a marketing function now. That voice mail that they read on their phone might have them go look at their LinkedIn profile that then might like to go the website and then come inbound to you. Now I can justify. You're probably not even gonna listen to that voice mail, but you're gonna look. You're gonna see the missed call. You're gonna read the voice mail, and you're gonna go check your inbox. On top of that, if I'm doing multichannel on LinkedIn, my email replies are gonna be two or three to one relative to just the email blasting rep, which is something that everyone else can do today. You know, I thought predictable revenue kinda ruined email in a lot of ways because it started, like, really littering the c suite with just spam. And then the cadence tools came out, and I was like, oh, Jesus. Now AI, it it's undeniable. The quantity game is over because AI can do it than better than most SDRs who are using the cadence tools. I'm not saying the best SDRs. The best SDRs are are absolute assassins. I would pay double for them if they're that good. But the average, and AI is already doing it better. I still don't like the spam that AI is putting out there, but it's better than the spam that the reps are putting out there. The FCC banned here in The States, they banned AI from making pure cold calls or calling out to people without, without their notice, which I'm happy about. Because I'll be honest, I was I was on that same track I'm on. I was like, oh, you know, cold calls coming back. Right? Because it's the one thing. And then I saw air.ai and, you know, and that and I was like, oh my god. I'm like, come on, man. Like, it sounded so good. And then, you know, I think the FCC put a put a guy by the way. Yeah. I'm looking at it right now. February, they banned AI generated voices. So thankfully. Because to me, I AI, I love AI, but as long as I don't feel like I'm being duped by it. If you're pretending to be human and I find out you're AI, I don't give a f how valuable this conversation is. It's over. But if you raise your hand and like, hey. This is AI, and I'm gonna have a conversation with you and we'll see how far this can go. Like, oh, this is fun. What I can get excited for in the sense that I've logged into organizations that have cold called days and I'm like, good Lord. I'm like, are you kidding me? A cold call day? There's not enough Red Bull out there for me to get hyped up for a day's worth of cold calling. But if you do the power hour hyper focused on a certain persona, do a little bit of homework on each one of them beforehand so you have a quick little talking point and then have your framework there, then you can go to work and be so much more efficient. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else.

Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes.
