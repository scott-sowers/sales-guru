## Transcript

A lot of times the difference between the top rep and the average rep is not how hard they're working, but it's the way that those top reps are spending their time. They're squeezing more juice out of every single hour because they figure out what makes them money in their sales day, and they find out how to do that stuff first, and then make time for all the other b s that gets thrown on your plate in sales. And so I'm gonna walk through my exact sales calendar that I used when I was an AE, and then I also coached all all of my reps on when I was a VP of sales leading a team of 40 plus reps. Alrighty? So my last quarter as a SaaS sales AE, I did 287% of my number. I'm gonna be honest. I was not the best closer at the time. There were two things I was good at. Number one, I was really good on the phones. I was really good at prospecting. I knew how to book meetings. And then number two, I knew how to manage twenty, thirty, sometimes 40 opportunities in a transactional deal cycle while continuing the prospect even if it was the end of the month. So we're gonna take two steps in breaking this down. Number one, I wanna talk about, like, three time blocking or calendar management principles that just explain, like, anytime you're trying to figure out, like, when you should be doing something or what you should be spending your time on, this will give you, like, the guiding point for that. And then number two, we're gonna walk through my literal calendar where there are four layers to building the perfect sales calendar. Alrighty? So let's get into this thing. So first, I wanna talk through three key principles when it comes to managing your day in sales. So the first principle is called front loading. Front loading means you literally take the hardest part of your sales day and you do it first. So I remember when I first started insurance, we had no cold emails. It was a 100% cold calling, 100% commission only culture. And what they would do is every single day, they would start us off, they would get us into a room at 8AM, they would put the numbers on the board, and then they would say at 08:30AM, everyone is going to start cold calling together. And you would be amazed, it was really really really hard to miss your cold calling commit if you were forced to do it with a group first thing in the morning, unless you literally were not dialing efficiently during that hour. And so here's the thing folks, is a lot of times when people go from SDR to AE or they go from meeting setter to closer, a lot of times what happens is they're like, oh, the most important thing is revenue rules off, and so I need to prioritize my customer calls or meeting prep to make sure that I can actually close these deals. That is not true. You need to take the thing that is the hardest thing to do, and you need to do that first. And nine times out of 10, the thing that requires the most energy from you is picking up the phone. If you go through two customer calls, and then you research 20 accounts, and then you eat a lunch, and then you do a pipeline review with your manager, And then at the end of the day, it's 3PM, and you're like, alright. Time to do 50 cold calls. There's no way you're gonna get it done. And so the rule that I would usually set when I was coaching AEs is if they were really struggling to hit their activity commit, I would literally be like Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alrighty. Here's the deal, dude. You are not allowed to open your inbox until you make your first 40 dials. That means you get in at eight or you get in at 08:30, and you dial from nine to ten. And I hope you check your inbox last night because a prospect can wait between nine to ten for you to get a reply, even if it is the end of the month. And I know that's gonna make a lot of people cringe right now, but, like, to hammer home the point, if you are not done with your cold calls by 10AM, then nine times out of 10, you are going to miss your cold call commit because that is the hardest thing to do and other things are pulling you away. So that's number one. Number two is called time blocking, AKA Parkinson's law. Parkinson's law is a law that states the longer you allocate to do a task, the bigger that task will get. So for example, if I say I have an hour to get ready for work, I'm gonna spend that whole hour like cleaning up the floor, maybe I put a dish away, maybe I make my food, maybe I like make my bed a little bit more, maybe I sit on the couch longer, maybe I read longer, and then I'm gonna walk out the door. If I know I have five minutes to get ready for work, I'm gonna be like, shoot. I'm gonna prepack my bag last night so that I can literally wake up, throw water on my face, grab my backpack, and leap. And guess what? I'm still out the door ready for it. So this is not me advocating that you should do every single thing in a rush, but whenever you decide to do something, I always recommend putting a time block on the calendar that forces you to say before you recommend putting a time block on the calendar that forces you to say before you start the task, this is how long I think the task should take. Usually, when you're doing any sort of deep work, thirty minute blocks are not good. Thirty minute blocks should be used for very quick tasks or for very quick alignment meetings. But if you gotta do something hard like cold calling, the hardest part of cold calling is your first five dials, your worst five dials. And so usually what you wanna do is you wanna block off an hour because the first ten minutes are like warming up and just like, oh, god, like someone kicked my ass over here, and it's like, okay. Now after my first fifteen minutes, I'm warm. Imagine if you stopped after fifteen minutes, you're gonna get like 10 dials in thirty minutes. Go all the way through the hour and sprint through the finish line, and force yourself to hit 40 dials in an hour or maybe more if you're using, like, a parallel dialer. The third principle is stacking. So what stacking means is you want to stack similar types of activities in similar parts of the day. So for example, it's really really really hard to go from researching accounts, to customer meetings, to pipeline reviews, to cold calling, back to researching accounts, back in the customer meetings. And the reason for that is your context switching. So mentally, it's just a lot of load on you to your energy switching. So it's a different energy to bring into, like, a customer meeting than it is to bring into cold calls than it is to do, like, account research where you're sort of, like, tinkering away at the computer. But then also, literally, like, your computer setup is completely different. Like, your tabs for account research are different from your tabs when you're, like, clearing tasks on email, which are different from your tabs when you're cold calling, which is just, like, one screen. You're looking at that only thing. So, like, try to stack similar activities. If I'm meeting with customers, I try to stack as many customer calls as I can back to back with quick little bathroom breaks or things like that. If I'm researching accounts, I usually do that, like, all my list building for two hours at the end of the day where it's like, alright. I'm gonna prep for all of my meetings tomorrow. I'm gonna do all my recaps from today, and then I'm gonna prep my entire list for tomorrow. And, like, all of that stuff is sort of the administrative work. But when you go from, like, prospecting to meeting to admin, back to prospecting, back to meeting, back to admin, like, you'll find that, like, you have to get into the momentum again and again and again. And, like, that's usually what ends up up killing someone's day. It's not that, like, they don't have the right things blocked in their calendar, but it's like they're switching from thing to thing to thing to thing to thing, and they're never actually completing it. So we're gonna take these three principles, and we're gonna use that to build our calendar in a couple different steps. Okay? So I'm gonna pull this up right here. Step number one is you wanna divide your day into three types of hours. So you've got your green hours, which are really the hours of, like, 8AM to 12PM. Okay? Those are your morning hours when you usually have the most energy. Your goal in your green hours is you wanna try to hit your prospecting goal inside of your green hours. Okay? So what that means is like especially cold calls, you wanna get all 40 cold calls you're making or whatever your dial commit is done by noon. K? You put it first. So then you transition, you usually have some lunch, and then you go into your yellow hours. And after lunch, there's, like, a big decline in energy, but when it's still early afternoon, you can usually muster up the energy to jump onto a meeting or a customer call because it's a little bit more energizing to be having, like, a back and forth conversation with someone than it is to be, like, cranking out those cold calls. That's really hard to do at 2PM. It's not hard to jump on a discovery call at 2PM in my experience. Okay? So call it from, like, twelve to three, give or take, those are your yellow hours. And, again, you wanna stack as many customer calls in those hours if possible. Now you can't always control when your demo request round robin is gonna be, like, putting meetings on your calendar, but whenever I'm booking meetings on a cold call or whenever I'm booking follow-up meetings in my sales cycle, I always try to put them in that twelve to three block. Here's the thing. Inevitably, some of those customer calls are gonna, like, get pulled into those green hours because you can't control it. You have a one hour dial block and a one hour email block. You are not allowed to move that dial block outside of the green hours. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has rep can't answer that question, the deal has a risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. So the moment customer calls start to crowd into your morning, you just gotta move the dial block, and you are never allowed to delete it. Okay? So those are your green hours. And then you've got your red hours, and your red hours are the hours where it's purely administrative tasks. So anytime I see someone who's like list building at eleven, I'm like, you are burning dollars because you literally could be doing this at 3AM if you wanted to. You do not even need to have a customer who's awake to build a list, to send a recap email, to prep for a call the next day. The only reason you're doing it is it's the easiest thing to do, and that's why you should do it at the end of the day. Is the death of a sales rep is in the red hours. Is when you start letting admin bleed into your golden or green hours. You gotta push all that stuff to the end of the day. So let's actually break down what this looks like in practice because this is like what the calendar should look like. But the reality is like meetings get thrown on your calendar, you get distracted by emails, and you gotta make time for some of the other things in sales. So there are a couple steps actually like getting this thing right. So step number one is you have to tame your email inbox. And so folks, this is like the first thing whenever I train this topic with AEs, the first thing I hear them complain about is like, oh, no. Like, I've gotta be able to respond to an email on time because if a customer emails me about a deal, I gotta get back to them in five minutes. And I'm like, bullshit. You do not need to get back to a customer within five minutes. If you're relying on inbox checking while you're walking to the water cooler, while you're in the middle of a Dial Blitz, while you're in the bathroom, then you are not managing your deals. Your deals are managing you. So my goal is at any point in the day, I wanna make sure that I have time to respond to urgent deals and customers. So there are three inbox blocks that you're gonna put on your calendar. Your first one is first thing when you get in, unless you're on one of those funky dial commits for me. You're gonna check your inbox, and you're only gonna clear out the urgent customer comms, and then you're gonna close it. If your manager has questions, if your company has questions, if there's, like, an HR onboarding task you have to do, you're gonna do that stuff at the end of the day, not at the beginning of the day. Then you're gonna do another inbox and lunch block at noon. That's another one. And then your last inbox block is gonna happen after you take all of your customer calls around 3PM. Okay? So you're gonna reply to your customers at eight or 9AM. You're gonna reply to your customers at, like, noon. You're gonna reply to your customers around three. Sound good? Yeah. Your customers might have to wait two hours for you to reply. And if it is not literally the last day of the month where you are waiting on an urgent red line, that is totally fine most of the time. Step two is you've got two morning prospect blocks, one afternoon flex block, we'll call it. So here's the thing folks, is you've got two prospecting blocks, you wanna make the first one cold calling. And the reason for that is there is no interpersonal risk associated with sending emails, and usually, you can even send emails when you're pretty tired. The hardest, most energy draining thing to do is to pick up the phone. K? So you're gonna do your cold calls first. So right after you inbox, you're gonna jump right in your cold calls. We'll get to this a little bit later. That means you have to have your list built in your red hours the night before. If you're building your list after you check your inbox, you're burning green hours. So you gotta make sure that your list is built at the end of the day, that you can come back in the morning and be like, boom. I'm literally getting in, grab my coffee, check-in my inbox, boom. The phone is on my face. Then you can have another block later in the morning to finish up your emails. Or if you didn't hit your dial commit, I really recommend hitting that morning block again on cold calls, and then use the afternoon flex block for your cold emails. Those first two blocks get you to quota. That third block gets you to president's club. So if you can get ahead on your cold calls and your cold emails in those first two blocks, then that third block is your leftover time, where you can go deeper into the green and you can build more pipeline than other people are building because you manage your calendar effectively. And then step number three is you start to plot customer calls in the gaps. So I literally recommend you put those dial blocks on your calendar, and then as customer calls come on board, you can start to move them around, but you're not allowed to move those first two blocks, especially that dial block, out of the morning hours. So you start to fit customer calls in the gaps, you make sure you have some bathroom breaks, etcetera. And then the final step is you move all the admin to the end of the day. So I always, like, ran the triple at the end of the day. There were three things that I would always do. So I would write all of my recap emails back to back to back to back to back. That means you need to take good notes. And then I would do all my meeting preps for the next day. Back to back to back to back to back to back. And then I would do all my list building. And I'd be like, alright. Today, I'm gonna pull 25 accounts. And then the next day, I'm gonna pull 25 contacts for those accounts. And the next day, I'm gonna write all the emails for those accounts. Or I would say, I'm gonna do 5555, account all the way through email all the way through. K? It doesn't really matter. Figure out the workflow that's best for you. But what's most important is you follow that principle of stacking, especially when it comes to your inbox, your recaps, and your prep. Okay? So what a lot of people do is they'll see these like customer calls over here or something like that, and they'll be like, okay I'm gonna like get off this customer call and it was a really good discovery call and like I gotta send that recap email right away. Or like I've gotta send them the business case recap right away, or I've gotta reach out to each of the people that was on the demo right away, right after the meeting. And like, guys, that's not true. Like, you your customers, right after your call, they're on to another call just like you. Nine times out of 10, your customer's gonna be like, yeah. I have a hard stop at the top of the hour. You can wait. The only thing that is time sensitive is if you literally need to send a contract or if you need to send something that your customer needs to take action on internally. Like, if they need that business case, they need it to be able to make the presentation internally, and they gotta do it today, then you can send that right away. But nine times out of 10, a plain recap email, if there's already a next step on the books, is just like a refresher for your prospect. They will clear their inbox at the end of the day, just like you clear your inbox at the end of the day. So that's step four is all your admin is at the end of day. So you might be wondering like, if I'm an SDR and, like, I don't close deals, only thing that changes is I want you to imagine that, like, your green hours get duplicated for the yellow hours. So really simple to recap, there are three principles that we went through when it comes to managing your time in sales. The first is front load the hardest thing first. The second is you wanna make sure you time block certain tasks, AKA Parkinson's law. And then the third is you wanna stack similar types of activities together so that you can get momentum in them. And then we went through the four layers of the calendar, but the biggest thing you need to remember is, like, those green hours from nine to twelve, hit your prospecting goal. From twelve to three, those are your yellow hours. Take your customer calls. Three to six, those are your admin hours. Build your list in those blocks. And folks, if you do that, you will get massively more done than most salespeople do. The way that I know you will be doing it right is at the end of the month, you will still be hitting your cold calling commit. Or when you get busy or when you get big pipeline, you will still be hitting your cold calling or your pipeline goal or your prospecting goal and everyone else will be saying, I don't have the time to prospect. Don't be that rep. The reason that you are literally watching this video right now is because you are not one of those reps. Reps. So go be the exception to rule and make it happen regardless. Folks, if you like this one, I've got two resources for you. Number one, I broke down this entire topic in newsletter format and written format as well if you just want, like, a hard copy with all these screenshots. And the second resource that I have for you is if you are making cold calls or you're making time in the morning cold calls, you might as well make sure that you're pretty damn good on the phones. And on this topic, our cold calling course literally has an entire section called how to be a machine, where it goes in, like, 10 x detail on all of these concepts of, like, how do I time block in my day? When I'm cold calling, what should my layout be like? How do I get momentum in my dial blitzes? What do I do if I book a meeting? Do I set the meeting on the spot, or do I go back to cold calling? As well as all of the cold calling scripts and everything else you could need to be successful on the phones. It's called cold calls to presidents club. And because you're watching this, there's, like, a special discount link somewhere here down in the show notes. Go check it out. It's the best cold calling resource that we have, and multiple teams are using it to literally book one in three cold calls every single day. And, like, that is the key to making it to Presidents Club. Because if you can book one in three cold calls, folks, you're gonna go really far. Alrighty, folks. We'll see you on the next one.
