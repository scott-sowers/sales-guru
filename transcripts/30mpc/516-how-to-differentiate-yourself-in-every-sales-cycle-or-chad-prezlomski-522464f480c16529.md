## Transcript

Sales is a is a competitive sport battling against other account executives for business. And let's say, for instance, you have similar products. What's gonna win that business? And to me, it's the things you do as part of the sales process to showcase a better experience as a partner. Preparation, right? Showcasing to prospects you understand their business before you get on the phone with them goes such a long way. If you go in cold right away, it just doesn't show that you're trying to, you know, go above and beyond. Follow-up faster. And when I say faster, I don't mean follow-up tomorrow or follow-up today. I mean, how do you follow-up within a half an hour after after a demo to assure that you're creating what the approach is gonna look like once they are a customer, like an athletic sport. How could you run faster, be stronger from a sales standpoint? And really, it's just thinking as a partner versus a vendor, as an account manager as an AE versus somebody who's just trying to get a fast fast sale. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. I'm your host today, Nick Sigelski, joined by the wonderful Mark Casagolo. And today, we have Chad Preslomski, who is currently the SVP of revenue over at TextUs. Prior to that, he was a sales leader that climbed through the ranks from director all the way up to leading the full sales org over at Splash, and he led them through acquisition to Cvent, which is a massive, massive company. So this is somebody with a ton of sales experience. Mark, why should people listen? I think, Nick, that there's three main ways you can differentiate. One is price, meaning your discounter, so don't do that. The second is with your product. That means really understanding where your product the last one is your sales experience. And I think what Chad gets into in this episode is, listen, if you don't have a bright price differentiator, if your product is somewhat similar, boy, you can ramp up your win rate and how much money you're making by differentiating on your sales experience. There's a lot of tactical ways to, like, really make sure that you outshine your competition. Alright. And a three three three deliver everything in threes. You all should understand that in just a moment. Alright, Chad. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Alright. First one is something called the rule of threes. This is something I learned early in my career, and it's a a timeless principle that essentially, you know, make sure that you are giving the information you need to your prospects in a way they can receive it easily, understand it, and retain it. There's a lot of science behind cognitive overload and how to deliver information, and three is the right number to make sure that you're honing in on exactly what's gonna stick with your prospects. A good example of that, which would be basically, you know, doing a discovery call and then reiterating to them the three pain points that you were able to uncover. Quick example is, you know, one thing I noticed is you're not seeing the response rates based on the actions you're taking. Two, it's taking too long for your contacts to actually load into the CRM so sales can follow-up. And three, you're wasting hours of time on manual efforts across your team. Great. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Well, I'm really glad that we start the show with top three actionable takeaways and not five actionable takeaways. So what's number two, Chad? Number two is sending a no ask email nurture campaign to close lost. I think close lost approach to me is a gold mine. It's something that is going to be a superpower for any AE who can follow-up appropriately. There's a lot of different ways you can do that. You can do it quick. You can do it dirty, or you can do it in a way that you can be a true partner and actually follow-up with information that's gonna provide value, but also assert that you're waiting for the right time to purchase. So for instance, sending a blog post or an industry report to a prospect you lost two months ago saying, hey. You know what? This reminded me of you. Thought you might find it valuable as you continue to evaluate. Looking forward to touching base with you down the line. Again, not being pushy, but being a true partner, and that's gonna set you up for future pipeline growth. Very nice. Round us out. What's number three? Number three. One of my favorites is storytelling and sales. Now this isn't anything new. Right? I think storytelling and sales is something we're always trying to do, something that's really gonna get the brains firing across our prospect and buyer base. But I think it's the kind of stories you tell which are really important. Right? And I think oftentimes, what I see teams do is tell a story around our client saved $2,000,000. To me, that's not a story. That's presenting some data or maybe some ROI. A story is like a movie or a novel, right, where you're creating, an image in the prospect's mind. An example can be, you know what? The CFO called me at 6PM last night on a Friday. Excited because our solution just helped them close the books five days early for the first time his entire career. Story like that allows somebody to be in the shoes of that potential client and really will help you lock in that deal down the line. I love that story example. Like, so like, the call me at 6PM, it just gets you like, you're immediately engaged. What the fuck is he doing calling you? It's just insane. It's dope. Listen. I wanna get into something that we did talk about in prep chat, which is, reps right now, I think, have an opportunity to let their sales experience win a deal better than ever because there's so many solutions. There's so much AI stuff. There's so much like, I can't tell the difference. People can feel the difference of the sales experience. So I would wanna start with this kind of nurture thing with closed lost. Like, go go a little deeper for us. Like, how does someone like, Martin, nurturing's marketing's job. Right? Like, why the heck is a rep doing nurturing? Yeah. I agree. Right? And I think today, right, there's there like you said, a lot of solutions and a lot of vendors and, you know, there's a lot of sellers desperate for dollars. Right? And sometimes that desperation can, you know, change or iterate your approach. I think what I'm seeing successful is AEs who essentially act like account managers. Right? So you're gonna lose a lot more opportunities than you're ever gonna win. Right? And it's not because they don't like your product, not because they don't like you or the organization. It's things shift. Right? Budgets change. Priorities change. People leave the organization, and sometimes it's just throughout that perfect timing. If you take the right approach, especially for people you've engaged with in the past to, you know, wanna work with you, but the timing's not right, it can really justify what's gonna happen in the future. For closed loss, for instance, right, a gold mine bucket for me, as I mentioned earlier, you can do a couple things. Right? You can follow-up, with a general marketing email to see if they're still interested. You can set a reengage date, send an email, and say, hey. Ready to buy? These aren't the right tactics. Right? For me, it's following up, you know, maybe weekly, maybe biweekly with just check ins or pieces of content or value based statements that are gonna help inform their decision and also inform your approach. Right? You're not a vendor. You're a partner, and you're not pushing them to get in anything they don't wanna be, but you are helping them, you know, get further down the evaluation. When the timing is right, they're gonna look at you as the partner to go to, and and it all comes down to trust versus any other AE who's reaching out just to try to get a quick deal without understanding what they're going through, what their, you know, organization is currently, experiencing. Just gonna put you in a better position to outperform the competition when it comes, you know, AE to AE. What are some other situations where someone can do a nurturing as a rep besides close lost opportunities? Yeah. I think it's any engagement. Right? Anytime you're in front of of a potential client. Because think about it. If you don't win, a prospect or an organization one day, one month, you're gonna win them down the line with the right follow-up. And it can be for all the things I just mentioned. Right? It could be timing. It could be budget, from an opportunity. But, again, it can be because somebody does choose another vendor. But, hey, if they have a bad experience with that other vendor and they're not getting what they need, you have a great opportunity in the next six months to potentially win. But what's the approach you're going to take between now and then to ensure they're gonna look at you like a partner and not get another similar similar situation that they're in with their current vendor? So I think when you think about anybody you demo, right, it might not turn into an opportunity, but down the line, if you follow-up appropriately, the organization might be ready to be qualified and, you know, be an actual, potential customer. I think other areas of follow-up are, like, demo no shows. Right? People, who come inbound, very interested, but for one reason or the other, decide not to show up. Seen a lot of success in the past on, like, the reengagement. And, again, the right reengagement of trying to get these people back on the line for a million reasons. Because everybody's busy, they couldn't show up. If you approach it the right way and you approach it consistently, you're gonna see success there. Give us another cool Chad specific way that one rep can have a better sales experience than another. I think, like, it comes down the way I look at it is there's there's products and solutions. Right? And, you know, it's a it's a crowded market across a lot of industries, and a lot of solutions do the same thing. A lot of times, you're in a feature war trying to present the value, and really dig deep on discovery. But I think one of the things that's lost and one of the things that's really important to me is outside of product, outside of solution, sales is a is a competitive sport where, you know, you're essentially, you know, battling against other account executives for business. Right? And let's say, for instance, you have similar products. What's gonna win that business? And to me, it's it's the things you do as part of the sales process to showcase a better experience as a partner. Right? And a lot of things like that is, like, preparation. Right? Showcasing to prospects you understand their business before you get on the phone with them goes such a long way. Just shows you have a high level of business acumen. You wanna understand their problems. You wanna speak their language. If you go in cold right away, it just doesn't show that you're trying to, you know, go above and beyond, which, again, above and beyond is is something I say to my team all the time. How can you just follow-up faster? And when I say faster, I don't mean follow-up tomorrow or follow-up today. I mean, how do you follow-up within a half an hour after a demo to assure that you're creating what the approach is gonna look like once they are a customer. Because at the end of the day, presellers are creating the experience of what it's gonna look like once they're on the other side of the house. It's gonna be how they consider customer support operating, how our CSMs are gonna operate. So if we move faster, provide more value, aren't as pushy, and, you know, really honing on the things that are gonna help elevate their business, it creates, again, an image on post sale. And I always say too, bring in our post sale team. Bring in a CSM. Bring in somebody from support to sell the people as much as the product because I truly believe, like, that's really where you're gonna see the value. But, to me, it's like, again, like an athletic sport. How could you run faster, be stronger from a sales standpoint? And, really, it's just, you know, thinking as a partner versus a vendor, as an account manager as an AE versus somebody who's just trying to get a fast sale and not thinking about long term value. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busywork like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. So let's take this beginning of a sales cycle all the way through sequentially. And I'm curious. I wanna hear both of your guys' best practices. So let's start. I am an AE, and I get a ping in my inbox that, hey. We've got an inbound lead. The VP of engineering came on our site, and they said, looking forward to learning more on our requested demo. Best practice on there. What do I do? We'll start with you, Mark. When a lead hits your inbox or a reply from a customer hits your inbox, it's kinda like for me, like, a drop everything right now moment. I know a lot of people say, like, you should block your time and find something, but, like, to me, this kind of speed thing is is a huge deal. So, the first thing I would do is make sure that I get back to them quickly. What does that mean? Like, within an hour. Are you emailing? Are you calling? Are you going on LinkedIn? What are you doing? I mean, if you came in via email, I'm gonna send an email within an hour. Yep. If there's a phone number, I may try to call if I don't get, something back from the email by the end of the day. Awesome. So that person responds to you on email and they're like, great. This time works for me. They book something. Chad, talk me through. We've got this thing scheduled. It's scheduled for later this week. Are you doing anything special before that intro meeting even happens? And then when you get on the meeting, like, what are you doing in that first meeting as a way to give a better experience than your competition does? Yeah. You bet. So so I think, you know, one of the things that I mentioned earlier too is, you know, a lot of people are busy. A lot of people are interested in evaluating solutions. And I think a lot of time, vendor evaluation meetings are the easiest thing to peel off calendar. Right? Yep. Especially if you're working internally. So I think the follow-up, leading up to the first demo at least is super important. And I think it goes back to even, like, that nurturing that I mentioned earlier, which is, like, how can we provide value from the time we set that demo up until the calendar date to make it stickier? Right? How can we, you know, investigate their business a little bit more? How can we do a little bit more digging and provide them resources or assurances upfront that that call is gonna be worth their time? Right? It might be showcasing some other customers we're working with that we've been able to help, and we can't wait to talk to them about what we've been able to do. I think a series of touch points leading up in that demo is gonna be super important, to make it stick And show that you want their business rather than just setting the meeting, letting a week go by, showing up. There's automated ways obviously through tools that can do that, but I really do like a personalized touch, especially, again, if you wanna outperform your competition and go above and beyond. And then, again, depending on that first meeting, show you did the work. Right? They're coming to you. They're excited. Really dig in with some deep discovery. Ask questions based on the research you've done around their business. Try to dig into, you know, why do they wanna schedule a meeting in the first place? What's driving them? What's holding them back right now as an organization that they think that your solution can provide? But, really, that first call should be set up to, you know, really dig in from a discovery perspective on how we can help. And then how I like to shift it is, like, you know, let's not try and dump an entire product demo in one call. But if we can, let's jump into the product and maybe show one or two quick things that might be able to accelerate the organization or the business, which potentially makes a second call even stickier. If you can show it in action on that first one post discovery after you have a good idea the value you can provide. Someone that asked to see a demo that doesn't get a demo in the first call, immediately bad sales experience. Yep. Giving that person a demo when they're expecting a demo, good sales experience. And there's a couple concepts, Chad, I wanna unpack. One is something that I call, organic versus informed discovery. Organic is showing up, maybe doing a little bit of research and saying, hey. What are your three top business initiatives right now? Like, are what do you stay up? What keeps you up at night? Whatever, you know, boring generic question that gets asked. Guess when three reps in three different companies ask that to start the same meeting, guess how that appears? Forgetful. Right? Informed discovery is when you have a hypothesis slide. In the hypothesis slide, what you do is you get on there and you say, Chad, I did some research, and I came up with a hypothesis on why I think we're meeting. I would love for you to tell me how wrong I am. Can I share it with you? And then they're like, yeah. And then you're like and then I have a formula for the hypothesis. Despite a, we can't do x, which means we don't get y as measured by z. A are the current initial investments they've already made to try to solve that. We brought in a sales trainer, but our SDR still can't book meetings. Right? Alright. Because if you can glom on to an initiative they've already spent money to and turn it around, huge. Right? Second is can't do x. That is a BTL below the line user problem. Oh, you know what? Like, I just can't write emails fast enough. Guess what? CFO doesn't care about that, but the user does. So I don't get why is that is an ATL above the line executive problem. So I don't get the pipeline coverage I need. CFO cares about that. And then as measured by z is a metric that you can find has to do that. Now how do you get those? You can research. Hey. Try calling a couple people at the company and ask them if they can help you out before the meeting. Salespeople do that kind of stuff if you call them. Right? So this is I think that concept that you just said, I call it informed versus organic discovery. Organic discovery is when you can't figure anything out. That's having a low bar, a high bar, and controlling what you can control is informed discovery where you create that despite a can't do x, don't get y as measured by z. That that is a completely elevated experience. And guess what the best part is if you get it totally wrong. Yeah. They correct you, tell you what's right. Powerful principles there, Mark, that honestly, I've been talking about a lot with my sales team recently. Piece number one is Cunningham's law, which is it says the the fastest way to get the right answer to something is to post the wrong answer on the Internet. You go on Reddit and you post the wrong answer of something, you better believe you are gonna get corrected way faster than if you went on and asked that same question. Hey. I don't know the answer to this. And so you get to the information you're looking for faster when you actually present the wrong answer. But then two, Chad, one thing you were talking about is, like, you wanna understand their business. You wanna do your pre call prep. You wanna have do some research. And there's this principle that I think about which is visible versus invisible effort. Mhmm. I think most well meaning salespeople prepare for their sales calls to some degree. Problem is they don't inform the prospect that they did all of this prep. So, like, when I sold to law firms, I would literally show up with pages upon pages of notes that the customer had zero idea that I had done all of this work preparing for, and I would get really, really nervous and anxious. And, like, honestly, like, my prep was way better than how I would actually show up, especially when I was a new salesperson. And what started to turn the corner for me was when I said, hey. Like, I've got all these notes. I'm gonna do what Mark just talked about, which is, like, I'm gonna put some of this stuff on a slide and be like, hey. This is what I prepared for and what I know about you. And what happens is is for a lot of salespeople listening to this, they are selling to prospects that are far more senior in their careers than them. And it can be really intimidating as a 24 year old AE to sit down with somebody who's got way more gray hair than you, and they know way more about way more things than you do. But I think that I don't know. There's a saying like game recognize game. If your prospect sees that, like, hey. This person is conscientious. They've done their prep. They're clearly, like, they're doing the work. They're gonna give you the time of day, and they're not gonna be upset that you got it wrong when you pull up that, what did you call it, Mark? Like, your hypothesis slide? Hypothesis slide. Yeah. That to me is really, really powerful. So I think about visible versus invisible effort, and I never wanna have invisible effort in my deal cycle. I was gonna say that's a a really good call out in terms of the invisible effort. You wanna show your work. Right? And especially like I mentioned earlier, like, in a competitive environment, if you're going above and beyond and we continue to talk about the outperformance of organizations, like, that is a level above what a lot of reps are doing today. So, yeah, I mean, you are gonna earn respect fast if you take those extra steps to really understand the business, really understand what their problems are, let them tell you what needs to happen, and, you know, try to get alignment that way. So I love that piece. When you say personalized though, Chad, I'm I'm curious. Do you mean specific to that account in person, or do you mean injecting your personality as a seller a little bit into what you're doing? Well, I think you should be doing that every single time. Right? I think, like, personality is key. I think a lot of, you know and and this is, you know, kind of me jiving here, but I think a lot of selling is acting. Right? You need to become energetic. You need to be passionate about the product you're selling. That translates. But personalized more so to the organization, more so to, the personas that you're pitching to, right, and trying to speak their language, right, and understand what motivates them. Right? Is it conversion rates? Is it, you know, the bottom line? Is it less support tickets? Understanding what motivates somebody and personalizing it to let's say, for instance, the example we just talked about, understanding, you know, what the CFO is motivated by versus a VP of marketing in a in a buying persona situation is gonna be really important to win that deal and get consensus. So for me, it's a lot of personalizing specifically towards the organization, the personas, and really the goals, that they're trying to achieve. So let's talk about we've got a great first meeting because we showed up. We did the prep. We got our hypothesis slide. No invisible effort. We asked all the questions that we needed to. Call went well. I get off of the Zoom meeting with my customer or maybe my Microsoft Teams meeting. What does a world class experience look like from the moment I get off that meeting? Mark and then Chad. What I always try to do, I go back and look at the call transcript. And if you have, like, granola or one of these new ones, you can actually even copy your transcript and just put it into chat g b t. And what I do is I say, tell me three problems that we discussed that we can solve. And then I get those three problems, and then I create a, like, quick three bullet point email and it'd be like something like, hey, Chad. You know, thanks for the time today. I from my perspective, this is what I'm hearing. You need better pipeline coverage. You need a more consistent process. You need to be able to analyze your data better. But after each one of those, I'll put a little arrow, and I'll put, like, a really quick little pitch. And then what I'll do is I'll be like, I'm designing our demo around these three things specifically for you. So if these aren't right, let me know so I can get the demo right. I mean, that's that's very much on par, Mark, with exactly my approach. Right? And I love that you said three because I was gonna suggest that as well. I know. I was worried. He's not. Right? He's on 14. And it's again, right, there's a lot of discovery you can do. There's a lot of problems you can solve, and there's a 100 of the product you can show in a demo. But, really, what you wanna do is you wanna show the 20% of that product that's gonna solve 80% of their problems. Right? So in those three bullet points, if you can convey what you can solve and that can be the majority, like, that's what's gonna stick. So I think that is exactly what I would do. Like, we see three areas. We're gonna be able to show impact really, really quickly, and I can't wait to get on a demonstration to talk and showcase more of that. That's exactly the approach that that we would take today. And, and making sure that we have that demo on the calendar before we get off that discovery call is another key piece. Right? Pushing that urgency and just showing that you want a really, really clear and and tight structure. I have a question for both of you when it comes to recap emails because you guys both have led pretty substantive sales organizations and bought a lot of stuff. And I'm curious about something that I have a hunch around is, like, I feel like when I send a recap email, I'm not truly writing it for the recipient. I'm writing it for the people that they're gonna be forwarding it to, like their boss or their CEO. And I guess I'm curious from your guys' perspective, like, what helps you I want you guys to put your buyer head on for a second. What is most helpful for you as a buyer to see in a recap email that you're, like, then forwarding over to your CEO as, like, the VP of sales or CRO or that, like, your director is forwarding to you when they're investigating a solution? Because, obviously, the problems is one piece, but are there other things where you're like, hey. This really helps me figure out if we should be pursuing this as a buyer? Yeah. From my perspective. So, again, I I would want the same approach that we just described. Right? Send me a follow-up email with how you can help. I wanna know exactly, right, from from what we've discussed, how you're gonna help move my business forward and the examples I'm gonna see. I think the other thing that will move the needle for me, and and I mentioned this earlier, was I wanna know that you've done it before. Right? And I wanna know that pretty early because for me, what's gonna move the needle is, like, if you solved my problem with somebody in my shoes at a company that is very similar to mine, then I'm really interested. Right? Like, then it's not hypothetical anymore. If you have clear cut stories, so we talked about storytelling early, or examples of a beginning, a middle, and an end on how somebody was struggling the same way I am. We implemented your solution, and then we saw, you know, all of our numbers go up into the right six months after implementation. I'm in. And I'm gonna be asking questions. I'm gonna be learning more. But for me, it's what you can do for me, but also some of that proof early on that, yeah, we have case studies or we work with clients similar to you that we're solving this day in and day out. That gives me a high level of confidence, and that's a lot of social proof. Yeah. I would say for me, I'll never forget the sales cycle I went through with Seismic. We were a Seattle based company and at Outreach, Highspot was just down the road, and, you know, we wanted to kinda be Seattle y and and and pick them. But the rep sent something to me after the discovery call that I think turned the course of the deal. First of all, is he didn't tell me everything in the discovery call. He held back some very interesting information to use it in a highly leveraged way. So in the email he sent me after the demo or the discovery, he was like, hey. Whatever he said. What I remember, though, he goes, Mark, I talked to Hank, Riley, and Nate, who are three of my top reps. And they all said that they had problems with keeping track of the most recent version of the roadmap deck and this and this. He like, each name and what their problem was. And then he sent me a little, like, two minute demo video for each one of their things. Guess who was, like, ready to rock and roll on that demo for the full thing? And so he just, like, shrunk it down to, like, he he could have told me he talked to those three reps in the discovery call, but he didn't. That holding it back. So you did a great discovery call. But what changed the course of the deal was he had talked to my best reps. He understood. And to your point about this sales experience, it's a halo effect. Like you said, how I get treated in the sales experience gives me an inordinate, biased opinion of what my experience will be after we sell. Right? And so like that, seeing that, I was like, okay, this company works differently, and they ended up winning the deal. Wasn't good for us with our Seattle neighbors, but it was great for us as a company. We could talk about this for hours and hours and hours, but the clock is ticking, and we've gotta move to our final question, which is this. We've talked about a lot of best practices and good habits that salespeople need to follow. Now I'm gonna flip that on its head and ask you the inverse, which is what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? The biggest one that I see, and, you know, this isn't deal inspection. This is, you know, going through medic methodology and really trying to understand next steps. I would say, you know, what I see a lot of reps doing today and and they shouldn't be doing is assume nothing. Yeah. Right? If you don't have every single detail that you need to assure that the deal is moving in the right direction, ask. Right? I find a lot of times I'm talking to a member of my team, an AE, and when I ask a question, it's like, I think so. Or I, you know, I just assume they're gonna be speaking to somebody internally to get that approval, but they don't actually know. You are in grave danger if you're just assuming or hoping. Hope's not a strategy. Pretty popular book, but it it's it rings true. But I consistently see reps assuming that, you know, people are trying to get approvals internally. There's no legal process involved. We don't need a security review. We already have the verbal internally. And a lot of times, that's not the case. And if we just asked or dug a little bit deeper or clarified to understand, you're gonna have the tools you need to then combat, to objection handle, but you can't do that if you don't have all the information. So I I would say assume nothing. If you have a dot in your head that, you know, might be off or a piece of information that you don't have, go after it. Amazing. Chad, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Three step recap, one thing that you can do. So the three step recap, things that you can do to differentiate and give a better experience before, during, and after your first meeting with a prospect from a buyer experience perspective. Before the meeting even happens, showcase other customers in a pre meeting nurture. Share examples of, hey. Here's, like, three or four other customers that we're working with that are very, very similar to you. Start to give them confidence that, hey. You're not going to be this, like, black sheep who's totally different than the rest of our customer base. You are talking to the right company in the first place. During the meeting, and, Mark, you're gonna talk about this in a second, pull up that hypothesis slide so that you can drive the ship when it comes to discovery. You've done all of this effort. Do not let it be invisible. We talk about the difference between visible and invisible efforts. I want your effort to be visible. After the meeting, take the call transcript, put it into chat g p t, and have it give you in bullet point form the top three pinpoints that you can solve. Use that to inform your recap email. Alright, Mark. Give me something that we can do. Something you can do right now is inject a slide into your discovery deck called the hypothesis slide, and that slide includes our little formula. Despite a, I can't do x, which means I don't get y as measured by z. A are the initiatives that they're already doing. They're already spending money on this because it's such a big problem, and people don't wanna let go of stuff they've already invested in. They want it to work. So what you'll do is you'll glom onto that. Then can't do x. Those are below the line user level problems, projects, and pains. And then you don't get y. Y is the above the line business initiative that you don't get because you can't do x. And then z is the metric that matters. The reason why this is a deal that needs to get done now. Start your discovery off with that inform slide. And if you can't get it filled out, do a fill in the blank Mad Lib style discovery call. That's an amazing way to get a great statement that you can base the entire deal around. Oh, I would love to see a Mad Libs call. Armand has been doing sales calls that he uses a whiteboard on live, so you might actually have to try that. So, anyways, folks, thanks for checking out this episode. This is normally where we ask you how you can help us out, and we partnered with the team at TextUs to put together a best practice guide on how to get your prospect to reply to you in ninety seconds without sending an email. There is a link in the show notes. Go check that out. Thank you for listening. Thank you for watching, and we will see you next week on thirty minutes to president's club.
