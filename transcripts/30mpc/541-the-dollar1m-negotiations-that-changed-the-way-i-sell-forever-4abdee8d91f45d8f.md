## Transcript

These are three negotiating stories that changed the way that I sell forever. Whether it's buying a used car, negotiating a $1,100,000 software deal, or if it was an angry marketer yelling at me during a negotiation. I'm Todd Capone, multiple times CRO and award winning author of The Transparency Sale, The Transparent Sales Leader, and the upcoming Four Levers Negotiating. What happens when you embrace unexpected honesty early in an opportunity or during a negotiation? Well, this is the story of how I bought a used car, and the salesperson got the minimum amount of commission that he could possibly get. So I'm not the fanciest car buyer in the world. I wanted a used car or slightly used car. It's Ford Explorer. And I went online. I live in the Chicago area, so I evaluated a bunch of the local dealers to just see who had the kind of car, model, make, and age that I was interested in. First thing I did, though, is I went online. And I don't know if you've ever done this, but you go Google. When you're gonna go buy a used car, when you're the buyer, what are the three things that you absolutely should never do? And there were three that popped up, and I decided, like a jackass, to do the absolute opposite just to see what would happen. I walk into this dealership, and lesson number one they tell you to never do is they say you should never tell the salesperson when you're buying a car how you intend to pay for the car. They always tell you, wait until you negotiate the price of the car before you talk about the method by which you're going to purchase. Number two is they tell you that if you've got a trade in, you wait until you've negotiated the price of the car before you tell the salesperson that you even have a trade in, because they say that that'll impact how they price the car itself. And number three, for goodness sake, if there's something wrong with that car you're trading in, let them find it. Don't tell them. So I walk into the car dealership. They assign me a sales rep. I go sit in his office, and the first thing I did is threw all three of those cards face up on the table. So I said, hey, Frankie. I've got my checkbook out. I've already worked on the financing. I'm ready to buy the car today and I will pay for it outright. Number two is you see that Jeep Grand Cherokee in the parking lot? That's mine. I intend to trade it in. Oh, and by the way, see that smoke swirling around behind it? That was literally coming out of my car as I pulled it to the parking lot. You know that check engine light that goes on in your car? If it's flashing, I did not know this, it means your car's about to burst into flames. Mine was flashing as I pulled it. So I threw all of these cards on the table to start this conversation with Frankie. He looked at me, and we started talking. Within ten minutes, I had gotten a complete story of his ADHD diagnosis, and then he proceeded to tell me about his relationship issues with his father, and then he proceeded to tell me about how much he disliked his job. I decided to use a little bit for evil, not good. I always recommend with this stuff always use it for good, not evil. But, hey, when you're at a car dealership, why not? I asked him, hey, you know, I've never seen a car salesperson's compensation plan, or how do you how do you get paid? As he was working on something, he literally pulled the compensation plan off of a folder that was sitting in his desk. And so while he was working on something, I read his entire compensation plan. And in the end, I ended up buying the car that day, and he got the minimum commission that he was potentially even allowed to get because now I knew exactly what the compensation plan is. Is. But the lesson there is transparency begets transparency. When you lead with unexpected honesty and transparency, which you also do through four levers negotiating by playing your cards face up about what drives your pricing model, you will find that those old school haymaker throwing negotiations, they disappear. You will find rooms disarm almost immediately in terms of it being customer and vendor. In every case, when you do that, you find it becomes collaborative. And the relationships that you build with one another, especially in as a service environment where the deal is no longer the peak of the relationship that you're going to have with the customer, it is merely an early milestone to having customers that not only buy from you, but they stay, they buy more, they advocate for you, and they bring you with them to their next company. Always lead with transparency. Watch what happens. I think you're gonna be pretty astonished by it. So when a customer asks you about your pricing or they ask you for a discount, why hide it? Why use gimmicks? Why use word art? Instead, play your cards face up. Hey. Our pricing, as well as probably your pricing too, is based on four things. How much they buy, so volume. How fast they pay, so the timing of cash. How long they commit to the length of commitment, and the timing of the deal or that value and predictability. Your pricing is probably based on it. Throw those cards face up and watch the collaboration start and the adversarial relationship go by the wayside almost instantly.

Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. So that was the story of what's probably a pretty affordable used car. Let's go into a business to business negotiation. A few years ago, we were working on a deal and my rep, if he got the deal in on time for the full value, it was actually going to get him to president's club. And so we had aligned this deal really well using four levers negotiating. So the deal goes through the entire negotiation. All done. We get it all aligned in the contracts. Contracts done. Purchase orders are set up. Now it's going to the CFO's desk for final signature. CFO hadn't been involved in any of this deal at all. Zero. It's the first time he is actually seeing this. And all of a sudden from the sponsor of the deal, the sponsor sends a note to my sales rep saying, hey. CFO's got it. He wants to talk to you guys. And so my rep was like, oh, crap. Todd, will you please be on this call with me? Like, absolutely. So me and him get on the call, and this is pre Zoom. So we're all on just audio only. And my rep is in Ohio. I'm in Chicago. This customer happened to be in Ohio as well, but at their own location. But here's how the call goes. We get on. This CFO is the driest human being you've ever heard. Right? Like, you're you're familiar with Ben Stein. Just monotone, super dry. You probably have to hold a mirror under his nose to know that he's still breathing. I am Ben Stein. I am an actor, comic actor, game show host. Anyway, he gets on the phone and starts to, in a monotone style, say, I've got the deal. I'm looking to potentially sign this. But we only wanna do half of the number of users upfront. Now, this deal was going to be to arm 36,000 agents that have house parties selling handbags. Alright. What that means is they will schedule a party with their friends or with local neighbors, and they will bust out the handbags or I'll drink a little wine and sell some handbags. The technology was marketing technology that would allow them to send out the invites, do all the marketing around it, and get these parties all organized. There's 36,000 of these agents. So the deal was for 36,000. This CFO said, I only wanna commit to 18,000 upfront. And then we will take a look fresh look in six to twelve months and look at potentially adding the additional 18,000. I look at my DMs, and my rep is DMing me. Right? Like, because if this happens, he's not going to president's club. Right? And now he's mortified, and I'm like, put your phone on mute. I got this, brother. Like, we're good. Alright? And so as this guy went through his monotone, I then took him through and said, first of all, I was a human being with him. Like, hey. What's driving that? He's like, 36,000 is a lot. There's an implementation that needs to happen. We wanna get comfortable that this is actually gonna work before we commit to the entire amount. Cool. Then what did I do? Well, I took them through four levers negotiating. I explained to them that, hey. Listen. You're probably new to interacting with the way that our pricing model works, but our pricing is essentially built on four things. Number one is volume, so how much you commit to. Commit to more is better than committing to less. It also has to do with the timing of cash. You are paying upfront annually net 30. The length of commitment, you are committing to actually, in this case, I think it was just one year. And we had mutually aligned around the timing of the deal, and we are paying you in the form of a discount to get this done tomorrow. And so while you can chop that number of users in half from 36,000 down to 18,000, you've probably been not gonna like it because your pricing's based on 36,000. If you only are committing to 18,000, the price per for those 18,000 is gonna go up quite a bit. And when you go add the additional 18,000 in six to twelve months, your overall investment's going to be considerably higher. I can have the rep here chart out what that pricing difference would look like. But before you go crazy, just know that there are protections in the contract. If the technology doesn't work, if this doesn't work out, you've got protections through termination for cause and the warranty provision here. So there you go. It was dead silent. Like, this guy was a professional negotiator, and he had no idea what to do with the answer I had just given him. He ended up saying, yes. Send me over that pricing. I will take a look at it. Click. Like, I don't even think he said goodbye. Now I'm sure my rep did not sleep that night. We did put together the pricing. Again, the truth won't sell it, don't sell it. So it was honest pricing that showed them what having the investment now and then adding the second half later, how that would look higher, and pointing him to the language in the contract that protected him if this does not work. Sent that over. Next day, sure enough, signed for all 36,000 users, and my rep went to President's Club. So there you go. So the lesson here is your price should be your price based on the four levers of negotiating. Like I had laid out in that story, your pricing is based on how much volume they commit to, how fast they pay, so the timing of cash, how long they commit, the length of commitment, and the timing of the deal. In all cases, when you're asked for anything, be a human being first, understand what's driving that request. Take them through the four levers. Remind them of all four, and then have a conversation around those four as it applies to the thing that they're asking for. And I'm telling you, you will build trust. You will discount less, and you'll have your deals have a lot less often as well. So give that a shot. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. This last story is the story of the angry marketer that yelled at me. So when I was really first using four levers negotiating, I was on the sales leadership team of an email marketing organization. And in that space, when you think about email marketing, just think about the retailers and brands that send you email to your inbox every day. We were the engine behind that for thousands of retailers. The traditional model for that is companies offering that technology and then charging on a monthly basis. Well, we weren't doing that. We were charging building our pricing model based on upfront annual net 30 payment terms. So one of my sales reps one day, he was at the goal line with a customer, and this customer was not in purchasing, was not in finance. She was a digital marketer. Well, she had a problem with that. And so, apparently, she had lit up my sales rep. So my rep calls me and is like, hey. Will you talk to her? She's really upset about this pricing term thing. And I'm like, yeah. Sure. I'll get on the phone with her. She lights me up. This lady is yelling. Like, and I could almost feel the spit coming through the phone. She is saying, Todd, you and your entire company are completely out of touch with the email marketing space. Every single vendor in this space charges monthly and, oh, la dee da, here comes you along, charging us upfront annual. Alright. Was there a request there? Was there I didn't know, like, clearly, she was saying that she wanted to pay monthly and not annually. And this idea of being a human being had kind of gone by the wayside. But this is an opportunity to educate her about the pricing model. So instead of fighting her with her on this, I explained to her that I completely understand where you're coming from, and you're right. These other email marketing vendors, they do charge monthly. Our pricing model is built on the value that we receive for upfront annual payments. And as such, your pricing is based on it. If you wanna pay monthly, you can, but we'll have to adjust one of the other elements of this. You can either commit to more volume. You can either commit to additional years in the length of commitment. And at this point, we had already aligned around when they're signing, so I did not lay out the fourth lever for her. But I just explained to her that, listen. There is value in faster payments, the timing of cash, and our pricing reflects that. And if you don't wanna do that, you can, but we'll have to either adjust the price or make up for it somewhere else. It immediately disarmed her. She did not know what to say. But she was like, alright. Cool. I I make that makes sense. How much would it cost if we move to monthly? And I explained that to her, but then I added a little piece, if you're feeling kinda salty and you wanna try this, here's another element to this. Because this woman was not in procurement, was not in finance, I just took a opportunity to ask her a question and said, hey. Does your organization actually enjoy paying monthly versus annual? Because what we found is, first of all, it's a pain for us to be chasing invoices and POs and all of that. But for our customers, the same thing is true. They don't wanna be chasing POs and getting multiple invoices. Every time they gotta pay something, there's effort involved, and they actually like paying upfront annual, get it off the books. We're not talking about a massive deal here. I would also argue that once you sign this, the budget is allocated. So whether you pay monthly or you pay annually, probably doesn't matter from a budgetary perspective anyway. And she was basically stuttering at this point going, I, I I I don't know, but I'll go ask. And sure enough, the next day, they signed, paid up for an annual. And I asked my rep. I was like, hey. Could you ask her? Like, whatever happened? Did she end up talking to them? And she said, yes. Apparently, she told my rep that, yeah, they prefer to pay annually. It really doesn't matter, especially at this dollar amount. And the reason that they like to pay monthly is in case we suck. That they don't have already paid out for the whole year, and it's easier to not pay versus try to get their money back. And then I had explained to them that that's a silly approach anyway, because if we're breaching the contract, your remedy is not to also breach the contract by not paying. And you've got protections in the contract if we're not doing our job anyway, and there's a whole provision to make it right. So, anyway, that is the story of an angry customer that is angry about a silly thing like payment terms, and how you can use the four levers of negotiating to disarm that conversation and align them to what is truly valuable to your company, which is also mutually valuable to them because your pricing is based on it. And the lesson here is always go back to the levers. Doesn't matter how angry the customer is, how good of a negotiator they are, You will establish consistency and confidence always through the four levers. Those are three negotiating stories. There's so much more to come in the book Four Levers Negotiating. And the book isn't just a storytelling book. It isn't theoretical. I take you through how to position, how to propose, and how to negotiate using the four levers, as well as the most common things that come up in a traditional negotiating, both the simple things and the highly advanced things.
