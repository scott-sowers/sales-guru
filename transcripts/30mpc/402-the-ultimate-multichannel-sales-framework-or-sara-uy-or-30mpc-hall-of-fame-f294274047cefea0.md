## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Zagalski. And today, if we're around to the cold calling queen of TikTok, Sarah Plowman, now known as Sarah Uy because she's recently married. Sarah has some amazing stuff on cold calling that, honestly, you and I hadn't even thought about when we were writing our book on cold calling. She talks about everything from how frequently you should be cold calling your prospects over a two week period. She talks about how you should be thinking about hot prospects and staying on top of them. She talks about asking for in person meetings as a stronger CTA than asking for a virtual meeting. She gets into mobile versus direct dials and not asking too many questions and just going in for getting the meeting. So if you wanna learn from one of the best cold callers out there, you're in luck with this episode. And, folks, if you're not familiar with Sarah, she has over a 130,000 followers on TikTok and literally cold calls live on TikTok, and so you're not gonna wanna miss this one. In three, two, one, let's roll. Alright, Sarah. Welcome back to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Okay. So first and foremost, my number one tip is leaving voice mails. Everyone is always asking what I do for voice mails. So my script pretty much sounds like this. Hey, Nick. I was just giving you a quick call. This was a cold call. However, I was calling in regards to sales training and hiring as I noticed you guys were looking to hire SDRs. No need to give me a callback. I'm actually sending you over an email titled sales training and hiring. If you could respond to my email on that, that would be fantastic, and then I hang up. So that's tip number one. What's tip number two? Tip number two is actually a new one that I've been incorporating, and it's asking for feedback on a cold call. Of course, you won't always be able to do this because not every cold call you're gonna have the opportunity to. But ones where you pitch and you feel like you're getting really good energy from the prospect, why not ask for feedback? Give them a scale of one to 10. How do I do on my pitch? A lot of times, you'll get, like, a little bit of a laugh, and sometimes they'll even compliment you because it's the only way to improve at the end of the day. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Amazing. Round us out. What's number 3? Number 3 is good, old, reliable, nine before nine, and 5 after five. You guys, if you're listening to this right now, go ahead and book in time to do this. Nine cold calls before 9AM and five cold calls after 5PM. Book in your calendar. Try it today. I can assure you, you'll get so many more pickups than you do throughout the day. Alright, Sarah. Last time you were on the show, we spent most of the interview focusing on what you say on the cold call. I actually wanna ask you about the other dialing mechanics side of cold calling. And I guess I wanna start when you decide, hey. This is a prospect I wanna book a meeting with. How many times will you actually call somebody over the course of a week, a month, a year to try to get their attention? Something that we do on our team is, like, a two week cycle of the cadence. So, typically, I would actually say I'm more cold call heavy. I don't typically utilize emails that much just because I know I'm strong at calling and doing LinkedIn. But I would say over the course of fourteen days, anywhere between, like, honestly, like, eight to 12 times that I'll give someone a call. Obviously, of course, I'm not leaving a voice mail every single time. I would say leaving voice mails at, like, call number 2 or three and then again at the end. That way, I could also push in some LinkedIn stuff throughout there as well. That way, when I do call them, I can reference the stuff that I've sent them on LinkedIn throughout that two week cadence is really the number that I aim for. Do you ever get people who are like, why did you call me 12 times in fourteen days? Honestly, people are so busy these days. Trust me. Even if you speak to someone and you're like, this is a really hot lead. I can't believe they just blew me off. If you call them four days later, they're gonna not gonna remember that you gave them a call. Very few ones that do, I would say they're very few and far between. Like, don't worry about it too much. I think everyone used to be really crazy about that. How dare you call someone nine to 12 times? No one knows. Don't worry. So I've been doing a little cold calling myself recently. When I look up my prospect in my data provider, I usually see a couple different numbers for them. I usually see a, like, HQ line. I'll see a mobile line. I'll see their direct dial. And I usually try every number to see what's the best one. One of the things I run into sometimes is I've got a mobile number, which I know works for them, and they have a direct dial, which I know works for them. Do I call both of them and go back and forth? Do I double dial where I call the mobile, and then if that doesn't pick up, I immediately call the direct dial? What's your approach when you have two good numbers for a prospect? Yeah. People are gonna command me for this one. They're gonna be like, this girl's crazy, but I'm a double dialer. If ZoomInfo or some sort of system on my computer is giving me two really good numbers, why not call both? Like, they're right in front of me. Like, why would I call one number and then be like, I'll try the next one tomorrow? Like, it is right there. Just rip it. I'm all about it. Like, just go for it. This goes in line with your first dial should always be your worst dials from a connect rate standpoint. You wanna get all the bad numbers out the first time around. So call all of the numbers if you haven't gotten to connect because you're gonna be able to cross other ones off the list and be like, yep. That was a fax machine. That was a busy line. That was a gatekeeper. That was an HQ. Nope. That's the real one. They actually had their voice in it. There's no point in trying the first number on the first one, the second one on the second one, the third on the third one. Because what if you found the right number on the fourth dial? Now you have to dial that phone number four more times because you didn't figure that out on your first dial. So, Sarah, you are making a ton of calls to people over a very short period of time. I'm curious about the other channels. I know you're really big on LinkedIn. I'm curious your approach as it relates to when you start hitting on LinkedIn versus when you start calling versus when you decide to start emailing versus when you decide to send a direct mail gift to their office. What's your approach, and how does cold calling get integrated with your other cold outreach strategies? Yeah. Really good question. It's definitely changed and evolved over the last twelve months because my role has changed and evolved over the last twelve months. So if you hear me say something, what to do today versus what I maybe said six months ago, don't come at me. I'm trying all different types of things. But I think that is kind of my approach. Like, honestly, most of the time, I'll start on LinkedIn before I even call because I love LinkedIn and social selling. Sometimes I hit success and book a meeting right away from my first LinkedIn touch, so I don't actually ever have to call them before I meet with them. So I will always try LinkedIn first just because you can get creative and have some fun with it. People tend to really like videos and creative ways of outreach over, cold call these days. However, cold call still is the quickest and easiest way to book a meeting. I'll typically start with LinkedIn first, and then I won't start calling unless I really have to. For example, on LinkedIn, you can typically see if people have read your message, their little profile photo pops up next to the message. So if someone's reading all the messages I'm sending them, I'm like, perfect. This is the great opportunity for me to give them a call because they might actually know who I am because they've clearly read my messages. So I'll actually call them and say, hey, Nick. This is Sarah over at Pareto. I saw you actually saw my video. One, how much did you actually watch of it? And two, did you get my follow-up message? Did you actually even like the video? It actually puts them in a bit of a step back, and they're like, okay. Wait a second. Like, she clearly knows that I saw her messages, and I've been leaving her unread. So or I need to acknowledge this right now, or I need to keep pretending that I have no idea what she's talking about. So I actually like sending LinkedIns first before I call. You said you're really big on social selling and of your whole content side of things. I presume most people listening are not gonna magically become you creating content. Let's say I'm a rep. What is the social selling process that you teach people who don't have big followings? You don't need a big following. You don't even need one or two followers to do this. You're in luck, Armand. Take out your mobile phone and go into the LinkedIn app, go into a DM of someone you wanna message, and there is an option to send and record a video literally in the DMs on the mobile app on LinkedIn. You can only do it on your phone. You can't do it on the computer. So just to be really clear, because everyone's always on the computer. They're like, how do I send a a video? In the video, bring your personality as if you are cold calling them. Don't change your messaging. Don't change your script. You wanna stay consistent because the last thing you wanna do is, like, giving different messages in all different platforms, and the prospect can't put two and two together that you're actually the same person trying to send the same message. Hey, Nick. This is totally out of the blue, and I know you probably don't receive videos this often, but I'm trying to stick out here. Hopefully, it works. But the reason I was reaching out, noticed you were looking to hire SDRs, and I saw you saw you were connected with Armand, who I'm actually really good friends with through x, y, and z. And I wanted to get some time in the calendar. I'm trying to see if you have availability either tomorrow at 02:00 or Friday morning at ten hopefully, I'll talk to you soon. The fact that a video is popping up now in their messages, they did not get a video message that day. So one, you're already standing out. Two, you don't need any followers to do that. And three, prospects love it. Sometimes, I've even got people that say thank you for being creative and not just ripping my inbox and ripping the phones. This really stood out. So thank you so much. Yes. 10AM works for me on Friday. It is such a good feeling because once you get that one that, you know, you book, I'm telling you, I was hooked on videos as a brand new rep for months. They work tremendously. They're amazing, and you could use your personality and have some fun with it too. I remember the first time I tried to record some prospecting videos. It was like, hey, Nick. It's Armand, and I would have to rerecord it over and over. It would take me, like, twenty minutes to record a video. How much do you embrace the mistakes of the video versus rerecord, or how much do you allow there to be, like, flubs and things like that? Oh my god. I wish I could show you guys this right now and, like, share my screen. But when it was, like, my first week of being in SDR, and I it was during COVID. So I was at my lowest point because I was just like, I am trying to sell people to people who are literally letting people go during the pandemic. Like, this is awful. Sent a video to a prospect, and I was trying to get really good lighting in my house because I wasn't working in the office. I was working from home. So I was quite literally standing on a kitchen chair in my dining room facing the window because it was just really good lighting, and I fell off the chair. And I came back up. It's on my LinkedIn. Anyone can view this. I resurface it every once in a while. And the erase button and the send button look very similar on LinkedIn DM on the apps. I hit send, and the guy got back to me. He's like, Sarah, this is hilarious. Send me one again perfectly just so I could understand what you're trying to sell me. Like, he was so nice. And I booked the meeting. Ever since then, I'm like, embrace every mistake or you quite literally will be there trying to record one video for twenty five minutes trying to be perfect. Nobody's perfect. Prospects love that you're human. The fact that you're going out of your way to send this video and build the confidence to do that anyways will go a long way. So if you stutter over your words, just quickly be like, oh my god. It's one of those days. Sorry about that. Instead of trying to record this video 20 times, make a joke out of it. People love that. Embrace the mistakes a 100%, and you guys just made me remember that I should resurface that video very soon. So stay tuned because I will. So one of your actionable takeaways for my recap is going to be when you record prospecting videos, fall off a piece of furniture to improve your booking rate. Like, whatever you need to do to book that meeting, do it. I assume that even if you do topple over your chair, there's going to be some prospects that still don't respond to that first message. What does your follow-up message look like, and how soon after will you send it? I would say, if it doesn't take falling off a chair to book a meeting with you, like, what else do I need to fall off to get your attention? Probably something silly like that. However, what I always typically tell every single rep is if you don't get an immediate response to your video, my next message is what did you think of the video. Just that simple. I love sending that either the next day if I see that they haven't seen it yet or strike when the iron's hot. And, say, I send a video to you, Nick, and within five minutes, I see your little face popped up and I saw you potentially watch that video. I send it right then and there. What did you think of the video? Clearly, they're on LinkedIn. Strike while the iron's hot. This is your opportunity. Don't let them ghost you now. I almost always get a response to that. What did you think of the video? Of course, I've gotten some ones where I, like, didn't like it. Like, move on. And, you know, that's just sales. Shake it off, move on. Actually, even ask them what didn't you like about the video. What would you improve? Goes back to our ask for feedback. Why not? And the other time, I would say 80% of the time, prospects a little bit. And they're like, I actually really loved that. I I wish our reps were doing that too. For us, we have a social selling course that we celebrate, so it's kind of like you're selling yourself. So that's actually a really cool leeway into me selling them something too, which is really nice. So first touch point is the video. Second touch point, what did you think? Third touch point, maybe, what did you not like about it? Do you stop reaching out on LinkedIn? I would say right then and there. If I'm not getting anything else, the next day is when I'll call and say, hey. Did you get a chance to look at that video? I noticed you potentially looked at it yesterday. Is that correct? If they say yes, I'll ask for feedback then and there. If I could get to pitch, great. Or another thing to to really reference in your voice mail, like, hey, Armand. I left you a voice mail yesterday. I mean, hi, Armand. I left you a LinkedIn video yesterday. Just wanted to give you a quick call to see if you actually watched it. It was regarding sales training and hiring. Give me a callback when you get this message. Recently, I've been saying, I'm actually gonna shoot you a text. A text. Hopefully, that's easier so you don't need to give me a callback. And then I'll actually text them too. What do you say in that text? Very similar messaging. Like, I keep all messaging, try to, like, very similar because I wanna really get my point across, and I really want them to know that I'm reaching out for a specific reason. So the text would say, hey, Armand. Just left you a voice mail. I also sent you a LinkedIn video. Not sure if text is easier, but was reaching out regarding x, y, and z. Do you have time, x and y, to chat? What's the best email to send you an invite on? I'm all about this. I've told you before from our previous conversations and and in person, but I'm a big hard closer. I don't believe that it's, like, rude or disrespectful. I more associate as, like, a make it as easy as possible for them to say yes. If I'm texting them, I assume that they're really busy. So if I can give them times that in their head, they maybe know they're available, make it as easy for them to say, actually, yeah, I think I am available at 10:00. Here's my email. Why not? Again, a lot of people listen to this and be like, wow. Sarah's abrasive. Sarah is crazy. Sarah is harassing people, but I've never gotten that. So just try it. What you're doing is you're actually replacing a lot of the research and the tailoring where you're using the other touch points as your research or as your segue. So instead of texting someone and being like, hey. I noticed these SDR job posts. You're just referencing the other touch point. Or when you're cold calling them, you're like, are you referencing the video? And so you really only just have to find one really simple thing to reference in the first video. And the segue or the reason that you're reaching out on the other channels because you originally sent that video, so it probably reduces the amount of time that you have to research. And, Sarah, it also sounds like you're using a pretty simplistic form of research, which is just like, hey. I noticed you're hiring for STRs. Is it really that simple, or how much time do you put into researching your prospects? Yeah. I would always say don't put more than five to ten minutes into researching one person because a lot of the stuff for us is right there in front of you on LinkedIn. I saw your hiring SDRs is probably one of the weakest hooks for us. I always wanna go in with, hey, Nick and Armand. I saw that you're connected with Curtis Aton, who I met with yesterday, and he mentioned that you guys are looking to hire SDRs. That's way more of a stronger hook than, hey. I saw you're looking to hire SDRs because they could easily just be like, oh, Sarah just went to our job postings and saw that. She didn't really put that much effort in. So I will always add a referral before I say, I noticed you were looking to hire SDRs. However, I see they posted it two minutes ago, and I'm like, strike while the iron's hot, and I don't see any immediate connections. I will go in with that, and sometimes it does work. But I highly recommend doing five minutes of research, seeing if you have any mutual connections with that person that you can refer to. My next go to is seeing where they previously worked and seeing if they've worked with any of our previous clients and then referencing the work that we did with their previous employee. They love that too because sometimes they've actually heard of Pareto before because they have worked with us at that company, or they did know that that company worked with us. So those are, like, my two biggest ones, referrals, where they previously worked, and then what they're actually doing that we can support with. Will you still call somebody if you can't find any of those things? If so, what's your messaging sound like? Typically, I'll know if they're hiring or not. However, if it's nowhere to be found, and I'm just like, this is a really good company, and I know I wanna get into this company because we're working with clients similar. I will just see what space they're in and reference clients that we've worked with in that space, or maybe an article that they've recently published or shared and doing a quick skim of what the article is about that I could reference. So you read this article. You know, I could totally relate to this because of x, y, and z. I was actually reaching out just showing that you did something, but don't spend more than 5 to 10 minutes because you don't wanna drive yourself crazy for perfection. Sales is definitely not for perfectionists, in my opinion. It's all about taking risks and not being perfect and humanizing the entire sales cycle. That's how you build trust. It's really mad at me on LinkedIn when I talk about counts under five minutes, but the way you described it is exactly how you do it, which is you have the top four things that you're looking for in order of how important they are. So you have your second degree connections, your referrals. If you find that, you stop researching. If you can't look at companies they worked at. If you can't find that, then you look for if they're hiring. And if they're not hiring, no second degree connections, you haven't worked with them before, then it's like, alright. Industry. And that's your last thing. You just need the four things that are good openers. Nine times out of 10, you will find something. One last thing on this, Sarah. Earlier in the prep, you mentioned you have a hot lead list. What is a hot lead list? Really good question. I have mine right here. I just put hot leads on my to do list. I actually booked one of them as you can see right there. Pretty good ratio, one out of five today so far. My hot lead list will definitely differ depending on your ideal customer profile and who you guys go after. But for us, since we're sitting in Manhattan, it's easiest for us to help someone also in Manhattan because we'd already have a really good pipeline of candidates that we can immediately introduce them because they're here. So for me, a hot lead is someone in Manhattan because we are too. If I needed to meet them in person, I can seriously just text them and be like, let's meet downstairs for coffee, or I'll meet you in Times Square or here wherever. So that's important. For us, our ideal customer profile also is pretty much a company that has anywhere between, like, 200 to, like, a thousand employees because I know that they probably have a significant number on their sales team that we can help train, develop, or add to, and then also a decision maker level. So for us, it's anyone at, like, that senior VP or c suite level executive because we wanna immediately go to those people that have decision making powers. And, typically, in a company between 200 and a thousand people, sometimes even the CEO still, like, oversees the sales team. So for us to take a top of you know, top level approach and work our way down is really beneficial. Anyone at that c suite level VP in New York City, between that number of employees in their organization, because I know they have a sales team, is pretty much what I consider a hot lead. And so if someone is literally a couple blocks down the road, how does your cold call change, or how does your prospecting change at all? I always, and most recently, have been recommending an in person meeting, and that also makes me stand out because a lot of prospects I've been getting saying, actually, sure. Like, that'd be really nice to step out of the office and kind of change up a little bit of scenery. Let's meet downstairs at Starbucks or wherever we're going in New York City these days. That helps you stand out because I don't think obviously, people who are working remotely I love working remotely too. But going the extra mile and saying that you'll actually meet them in person today if they really wanted to shows that you're really keen to meet them. You're not just looking to meet them virtually to try and sell them something. You're trying to build a relationship, meet them in person, and understand a little bit more about them in the business and see if there if there is a way you can help. And I think it's a lot easier to sell in person because you're showing your personality. You're building that relationship. When I sit down with someone in person, you're not immediately jumping into the meeting. There's at least fifteen to twenty minutes of rapport that you're building in person than you typically do virtually. You're still building rapport virtually, but there's a lot more that you break down the barriers with when you meet in person. When I was selling insurance, I would use this opener you might have heard on the podcast before. Hey, Sarah. We work with a few of the partners in the Skadden office. It's Arman from Northwest. Have you heard your name tossed around? What I don't talk about as much is the way I would usually close is I wouldn't ask for a phone call or a Zoom. I would always say, I'm actually meeting with a few of the other partners on Thursday next week, and I'm gonna be in the office by yours either before or after my meeting blocks. And because they knew I was already gonna be in the office, it just felt so much lower friction for me to just swing by. And I know this isn't a luxury that everyone has, but if you're it's so much easier if someone's already there to just be like, look. You're gonna be there. Can I swing by the booth around this time? Find little ways to reduce the friction in the meetup itself. Sarah, you gave an entire clinic on how you actually work through the cold call itself from your opener to your pitch to objections and all that stuff on your last appearance for thirty minutes to Presidents Club. So we'll put a link to that in the show notes. But for anyone who hasn't listened to that yet, would you mind just giving us the short version of cold call script from opener to pitch? So I'm pretty much known for the you're gonna hate me. This is a cold call, so I'll probably use that one. Hey, Arman. This is Sarah Repredo. You're totally gonna hate me. This is actually a cold call, but I was wondering if you just had twenty seven seconds to chat. Reason for my call call, Arman, I was actually speaking with Nick Sigleski yesterday who recommended I reach out to you. And I noticed you were looking to hire SDRs as well, which is exactly what we do here at Pareto. Here at Pareto, we're a global sales performance organization. We help clients in three main ways, hiring rockstar SDR talent, senior hiring, an account executive with VP of sales, and we're a fully fledged sales training organization. Whether that's upscaling your current team or people we place within your business, it's kind of two ends in spectrum there. Definitely not trying to sell you anything right now, Armand, but looking to learn more about your goals and priorities for your team heading into the second half of this year. Do you have time on Friday at 10AM or 2PM eastern to chat more about those goals and priorities? Unfortunately, the clock is ticking, and we are running out of time, Sarah, so we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We have talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Asking too many questions and not closing. So I remember doing this all the time. It was almost like I was looking around on the sales floor for help of, like, where do I go next? I'm out of questions. It's amazing that you guys are asking so many questions, and you're getting all this information that is going to help you, but don't forget to close. I think a lot of SDRs miss that opportunity to just go in for the kill, and they stress too much about asking the next question. They don't know where to go, and that's where you start to really panic and get really anxious. So I would say nail down one or two questions that you can absolutely ask and get really great information for after your pitch. But once you've gotten those, go in for the kill, close for the meeting, give two times, two dates, make it as easy as possible for them to say yes to you, go for that kill window and close for the meeting. Sarah, thank you so much for joining us again on the show. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Sarah Plowman. What do you have for your two? So my first is the funny video one, which is if you screw up when you were recording a prospecting video, embrace the mistake. Still send the video. Unless you do something horribly offensive, send it. Sarah literally fell off a chair, sent the video, and ended up booking a meeting. Embrace the mistakes. My next one was her last thing, which was the answer to the final question. When you're on a cold call, don't overstay your welcome. Go in for the meeting. If you're running out of questions to ask, make your last question asking for the meeting, and you will book more. Number three. The easiest way to follow a LinkedIn video is just ask, what did you think of the video? And then after that, you can ask, what didn't you like about the video? And then lastly, number four, the reason you're reaching out can the last touch point that you make. So you really just need to research one. So if you leave a, for instance, an SDR job posting, after you leave the video, when you bubble that up, you can say, what did you think of the video? If you leave a voice mail, you can say, hey. A LinkedIn video. And then if you connect with them live on a cold call, you left a voice mail the other day. So you can use the other touches as the reason for your outreach. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here? How can people help us out, Armand? Did you know I hope you haven't erased this from your memory. We wrote a book on cold calling. Cold calling sucks, and that's why it works. It is a step by step guide to calling strangers out of the blue, booking meetings, and building pipeline. There's a link in the show notes to go get it. If I might say so myself, I know it will help folks with cold calling. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
