## Transcript

Send me an email, dude. Just before I do that, is this just a polite way to tell me to go away? No. Like, send me an email and I'll take a look at it. So when you say you wanna see an email, is that because your inbox just doesn't have enough emails already? Look. You you guys are way too expensive. When you say we're really expensive, does that mean that pricing is your first priority? 90% of the time, they'll be like, well, no. It's about van. If they say yes, they can off. They're not rejecting Julia. They're rejecting a salesperson. The moment in which the salesperson becomes a human being, then boom. What's going on, folks? Today, you are literally going to get everything you need to handle objections, whether that is six objection role plays, the exact step by step process you need to handle an objection, and you're gonna get it from the world's weirdest, most hilarious sales trainer, Giulio Segantini. Nick, why should people listen? We did a bunch of live objection role plays. We also break down step by step Giulio's ACE framework to overcome any objection no matter what you get hit with. And so if you want to be able to overcome objections, prevent them, and book more meetings on your cold calls, this is a must listen. In three, two, one. Let's role play. Alright, Giulio. We're starting this episode with a little bit of cold call, objection, role play. So I'm sorry. I can't take this call. I'm in a meeting. Totally understand. Why don't I give you a callback tomorrow at 9AM? Would that work? May maybe. I'm I I don't know. I don't have my calendar in front of me. Look. I'll tell you what. Why don't I take thirty seconds now? If it's not relevant, I don't even have to call you back. Is that fair? Alright. Yeah. Fine. But make it quick. Boom. Julia, this is really nice, but but just, like, send me an email, dude. Happy to do that. Look. Just before I do that, is this just a polite way to tell me to go away? I'm, like, pretty busy right now, but, no. Like, send me an email, and I'll and I'll take a look at it. Look. Perfect. I'll do that. Why don't I take thirty seconds now? If it's not relevant, I don't even have to clock your inbox further. Is that fair? I I I really would just rather, like, look at look at some information. Like, hearing the whole pitch right now is, like, kinda I'm not I'm not really looking to hear the whole pitch right now. Okay. Fact. Look. Can I ask one last question before I go then? Sure. So when you say you wanna see an email, is that because your inbox just doesn't have enough emails already? It's it's feeling a little bit lonely. Well, I'll I'll take thirty seconds, and then look. I promise if it's not relevant, you're never gonna hear my Italian accent again. Fair? Alright. Fine. Fine. Shoot your shot, dude. Look, man. Thanks for the call, but, like, we're already working with somebody else on this, so I I think we're good. But but good luck with your calling, though. Thank you. Appreciate that. Look. I would be very surprised if you weren't already working with someone else. Do you mind if I ask you a direct question? Yeah. What's up? So does that mean you've decided to never look at another supplier? I mean, not never, but, like, I don't know. We started working with these folks probably eighteen months ago, and I feel like you know, I wanna make sure we give them a good shot. I feel like it would be too much disruption to just, like, immediately rip something that we literally just implemented. Mhmm. Yeah. Okay. That that that makes perfect sense, especially if things are working really well. I guess, are you at the point that even if a better option were out there, you wouldn't even wanna take a look? I'm never against learning more and getting better, but, like, I think the chances of us, like, you know, not renewing this contract in six months are are probably pretty low. It's not I mean, look. Nothing's perfect, but, like, they're they're doing they're doing good work. They're good people over there. So, yeah, I just I just wanna be realistic about, like, you know, you might you might be better off fishing in a different pond. Look. I appreciate you being cautious of my time. So do you mind if I ask a a bit of direct question about your supplier? I mean, there's certain things I probably can't share, but ask away. Of course. So you mentioned things can be better. They're really good. So what what would make it great to the point that you'd be like, oh my god. That there's nowhere I would ever change even if the impossible offer came on the table? Oh, gosh. I mean, they do a really good job with their, like, custom reporting, and I have a really good sense into, like, our business's cash flow. But, like, I think there's an opportunity for you know, one thing that that they don't do is help with, like, the the other financial analysis. And so, like, I feel like there's you know, we have we have other software that we use. I end up pushing a lot of stuff to, like, Power BI. And so I would it would be great if there was an all in one. I just don't think there's something like that out there. Okay. Understood. So it's more on the financial side that especially financial reporting that you feel is missing all the all in one. Could could you give me an example of how this is affecting your day to day work? Yeah. Nice. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. This is great because, like, I literally had to, like, channel my inner, like, law firm finance director. And, like, I know that's not a space that, like I don't think you have deep expertise there, but you were still able to, like, draw me out and open me up. So let's start to break down some of the things that you were doing that went into that objection handling. You, in fact, objected to our normal format of the show where we start with your top reactionable takeaways, but you did prepare some top three actionable takeaways. So maybe you can talk through, like, a couple of the things around, like, acknowledging objections, getting consent, scripting your explorative questions that, like, make you a badass objection handler. Uh-huh. Of course. So, look, I think the first thing is you guys are are experienced with this. Right? You're going to sales organizations all the time. Right? If you were to tell me what's the most standard objection response to an objection, what what do you think that is? They try to pitch through it usually. Like, if someone says I'm not interested, they try to, like, justify the ROI or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So so the best example I give to this is whenever I start training is like, look, guys. What you're gonna revert to doing most of the time is, yes, but. And then I follow-up with saying, like, if you ever tried it with your wife, how does that usually work? And they go like, I sleep on the couch. So why are you trying to do that with prospects? And they're like, oh, shit. So so that's that's the first thing is, like, it's the real acceptance. So I'm not just gonna tell you, yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna properly accept. You know, you told me that I've got supplies. I'd be surprised if you didn't. The person has dealt with calls before, so he's expecting me to argue with them. The moment in which it go the other way, it's a bit like deflating. Right? It's like, oh, okay. Didn't expect that. So a bit of the fight goes out of them. So their their nervous system, it comes down just a tiny little bit. Right? Now the problem is that that but will spike it immediately again, which is why, again, if you argue with your partner and you agree with her and then you go but, you very quickly find yourself in a worse position than before, and that's very similar to this. So you gotta completely accept it, make them feel like it's accepted. Think about the the first one you gave me about the I mean, the meeting. I said, look. Should I call back tomorrow night? Right? So I I it's like I believed you entirely. Right? And you were like, and sometimes people would even say, like, well, what is it about? And so I didn't even have to handle it. And then even though, well, maybe I need to check on my calendars. And then okay. Even better place for me to offer a a better situation there. Right? So that's the acceptance. Get into relax, get into lower the guard, and that's the first stage. Alright, Giulio. Before we move on to the next step of objections, I wanna practice this part with a couple of different objections. So what you wanna do is you wanna acknowledge the objection. Could I give you a few different objections, and you can tell me in return what it would sound like to acknowledge it? So let's start with one of the most common ones, which is just I'm not interested. Oh, okay. Interesting. Sorry. I something we would cover later. If it's a brush off Mhmm. I typically I'm just gonna challenge it immediately. When you tell me I'm not interested or, like, or if it's the same email, it's immediately. So I know you're just trying to push me off. I'm not gonna acknowledge it because I'm like, I don't I don't recognize it. I'm not I'm gonna challenge it immediately. Right? So there's a a very specific example. If you told them I'm not interested, my immediate will be like, wow. Is my voice that bad? Right? Or is it gonna be like, oh, is that because you hate cold calls or just me specifically? Right? I mean, immediately because, look, they're not rejecting Julia. They're rejecting a salesperson. The moment in which the salesperson becomes a human being, then boom. Which is why, like, I don't like deal, like, oh, that's why I called. I yeah. I don't like that because I'm like, that's not true. It's it's a lie. It's a lie. Right? It's just just, complete complete bullshit. So in this stand, like, I wanna challenge that. So that's why with the email, I'll be like, oh, is that because you don't get enough emails? I could go to that directly. That's why, like, I think maybe you we went to the one example that I wouldn't acknowledge. I would instead challenge direct. My question for you, it sounds like your approach is when you get hit with a brush off, your response is to do something that, like, deeply humanizes you and, like, pattern interrupts while also, like, challenging them a bit. You often use humor for that. My question for you is if I'm someone who's cold calling, how do I know the difference between a brush off and a real objection? It's very, very simple to tell. It's actually speed. They they haven't thought about it. If if we wanted to look at thinking fast is low, the the psychology book, this is a system one response. They haven't thought about it. I'm not interested. I know, like, you haven't at the time, but, also, I'm not interested at the beginning of a cold call. It's so easy because you know, like, they don't know what it is, so they can't not be interested. You know? What if I'm calling to sell you, like, a cure for your wife's cancer? Right? You don't know. Right? So, like, it just this is our auto part of the brain. But this also applies post pitch. Because if they hear typically, like, if they heard you and they listened to you, they will give you a bit more of a recent response. So if they go like, look, like you did before, like, look, we just got these guys. We've got eighteen months ago. We're happy with them. That's elaborate. You've been thinking about that. If you just told me, like, oh, no. We're good, mate. I know that you you just haven't registered enough, and that's when I will treat it way more like a brush off instead of just treating it like an actual objection. That's a really interesting distinction because the way that I always used to think about brush offs were where they came in the call. I assumed that brush offs would just be early in the call. And even if they hit me with I'm not interested or, oh, I'm all good, mate, later in the call, well, we've been on the call long enough that, like, they must have given it some thought. But if I actually think back to a lot of the cold calling I've done, I used to get a lot of brush offs right after my pitch where you, like, give this really thought out pitch, and they immediately hit you with, no. I'm good. And they know, okay. If I object there, I'm just gonna get off the phone. And so I think what I'm learning from you is it's actually the speed at which they give you the response tells you how much they actually considered what you were saying and if this is just a reaction or a thought out response. Look. It's not foolproof. So meaning that sometimes they'll be very quick because they really got it. But most of the time, what I find is, like, the quickness comes from the father they put me in a box. Mhmm. And this is one of the reasons why I don't I hate using too much about me in the pitch because then if you say, like, I'm a sales trainer or we do lead gen, we do well marketing, All of a sudden, all they're thinking about is all the shitty sales calls, all the money they wasted on similar service. And there's a bunch of crap sales trainers out there. It doesn't mean I will be. There's a bunch of terrible lead generation companies that that doesn't mean I will be, etcetera. So we the moment they put you in that box, you know, okay. This is my chance to challenge them and explore why is it that they think this way. So some of handling objections is actually preventing objections in the way that you pitch. If you give them too much in your feature jump, you're giving them more things to object to. So, Julio, could you take us one step back from the objections? What does your pitch sound like? In other words, how do you make a cold call pitch that does not evoke objections? Okay. Let's let's look at the best case scenario. Okay? So if I want to build a perfect idea is that I'll start with a good list. Mhmm. And by good list, I mean, like, clay research some research done, good targeting, good ICPs. So that's the start. If you have a good list already, rejection goes plummets immediately. Secondly, like, the the pitch is going for problems they face. Right? So can you guys give me an example? One of your clients, like, I'm just gonna or one of your prospects, whatever, just gonna build a pitch for them. Let's say that Gong is a big sponsor of thirty minutes to president's club. So let's say that you are cold calling Gong. When are we trying to about Gong, it's really depend on my service. Right? I'm we're gonna talk about sales training here. So what the first thing the first thing is gonna be like, I'm gonna make them feel like I understand them. So it's something I really like that I heard on on a podcast once is like, show them you know them. Right? So we'll start some stuff like, look. Hey. I'm let's say I'm talking to your head of sales enablement at Gong. Right? And I'd be like, look. I'll be speaking to a bunch of the others out of sales enablements or sales enablement leaders of other sales enablement companies. And what they've been struggling with is And then the next part is the show them you know them on steroids. And this is where you basically I call it the coffee machine test. You you wanna phrase the problems like they would be when they're bitching with their colleagues at the coffee machine. So it needs to be their language. So I'm gonna say something like, look. Problem number one is that you've got some of the best tech on the planet, and yet you're still finding that their overall framework and methodology they use for cold calling is not uniform. So you're struggling to for everyone to have the same approach. Problem number two is perhaps you've got some people that are making good calls, but then you got a bunch of them who don't even wanna pick up the phone. Either way, you find yourself with a bunch of gray performers in the business that could be turned into gold performers. But, hey, this is gonna be the part you're gonna say now to me. You know what? It's not a single person doesn't hit quotes in my team. I haven't said a thing about what I do. I just hinted towards it. I'm talking about their problems and problems that they face people feel similar to them face. And I also the negative frame is like, but you're gonna tell me not a single person doesn't need quota. It's just such a ridiculous statement that makes it easier for them to come and talk to to me. That's so interesting because, like, I used to always end my pitches with be like, okay. I would give, like, the problem pitch, and then I would say, I and I guess I'm wondering if you might be open to learning more when I'm not cold calling you out of the blue. I'd basically say something like that to anchor around trying to say, I'm trying to just get a meeting when I'm not cold calling you. You're ending with this, like, ridiculous statement that, like, no one is gonna be able to to push back on. I guess I'm wondering, how do you craft that statement at the end? Maybe you could give some examples of stuff that you've built for other other clients because I hear the one for sales training. Mhmm. So so look. I think the important part is that you wanna hit something that you know Yeah. They're gonna really struggle to to agree with. And Yep. Just just one step back. What do you guys think is the most scary word for a salesperson? For a salesperson? Like, a salesperson to hear? Mhmm. Performance improvement plan? Maybe. Maybe. But on a sales call, let's say. Hopefully, they don't hear that on sales call. I would say no. Yes. Exactly. So this is why this works so well because even I I coach hundreds of people, and this is one of the hardest parts to get them to do because they're scared of hearing the word now. They're scared of, oh, but if I say this, what if they just say, yeah. You're right. And that's the point. Again, I'm patterning interrupting one more time even in the pitch. Right? So the the three ways you can go with this is, like, really granular. But let's say I'm selling Gong. Right? And what's Gong's number one is it Allego, one of the the biggest competitors? I think they probably compete against companies like Clari, SalesLoft, Outreach, etcetera. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. So let's say that but you're probably gonna tell me that you never get frustrated about the fact that Outreach has got this, for example. Right? When you know they're on Outreach. Right? So you go very specific. Let's say you're selling accounting. Right? And one of the ones that we had, like, oh, but you're probably gonna tell me now. You there's never been a point that you thought, damn it. I probably should've been paying less taxes. Easy. Right? So so you go to this very easy to relay statements, which are also meant to humanize your bit. They they'll typically check all of them. They'll be like, nah. I wish I could say that. Come on. Okay. What is it that you're selling then? So now they wanna hear more. One that I really liked, I don't know if if this reached you guys as well. Like, have you guys seen the reel about, nothing can be the Jet two holiday? Yes. My wife has used that audio frequently when she was TikToking our honeymoon. Right. Right. Perfect. So I I've been using one number, but you're probably gonna tell me now that your team is so good, they can even beat a jet to a holiday. And then, you know, they'll be like they'll be like, okay. That's good. That's good. You know? Like, using stuff like this. Right? But so humorous route, very specific or a bit more ridiculous. That's the ones you can go to. But this just makes again, it just makes the whole thing so human. The more human you are, the the harder it becomes to reject. So we've talked through the humanizing pitch, which could be ridiculous, humorous, super granular. Then we talked about acknowledging the objection if it's a real objection or challenging the objection with humor, if it's if it's a brush off. So once you either challenge the objection or acknowledge the objection, what's the next step? So okay. So let's say it's not a brush. Let's say it's a real objection. I've got a supplier. I'm happy we've got a I've got whatever. Now at this point, like, what most salespeople will do, and by most, I mean, 99%. They'll just go direct, which then the problem is that it just sounds like a yes, but. Because if I say, oh, I'm not surprised you're telling me this, or, oh, I'm I'm happy you're happy, and then boom, you just go there. It's just gonna feel disingenuous. And this is why the part I'm breaking is like, do you mind if I ask you a question about that? Yeah. And this part is like, I I really struggle with Americans to teach them this because they we just wanna be so quick on cold calls. And then when they do, they're like, oh my god. It works so well. And this is just very basic. You know? You you guys know the food in the door, technique, like, the the the psychological theory. This is a psychological theory from Cialdini's book, persuasion. Yeah. And, basically, what he says is, like, if you want to get a yes about something, you start with something smaller. And anything works, which is why the sales reps in the sixties, seventies, they would they wouldn't try to sell, like, can I come in? Can I take a minute of your time? Even the permission based in the opener, that's your first permission. And now I'm having a second permission from their side. And then what this does psychologically makes them more likely to accept what's coming next. And then the ridiculous thing is that they almost never will say no, but I literally mean almost never. And you guys have seen this because you probably do the can I ask one last question? Right? That works like a dream. But now you also do this early. It's like, hey. Can I can you just ask a question about that with this curious tone? And they'd be like, sure. Go ahead. And now I've built another little agreement from their side, which makes it a little bit easier for them to give me a bit more information coming with the next question. This is what you did when I was saying send me an email, I think, is I was giving you a lot of resistance, a ton of resistance. And I was basically giving you a brush off, and you even used permission to ask me a humorous question. I was like, I don't wanna hear the pitch. And you're like, can I ask you one more question? And then you're like, is the reason you want a cold email because you don't have enough emails in your inbox right now? And not only is that kind of calling out the ridiculousness of my send me an email objection, it's revealing the human behind the phone. And so you're using both permission to, one, get people to realize that you're human, have them brace for you to ask one more question. But then, two, you're also using it to get more information about the objection so you can handle it more effectively. I think there's one more dynamic at play, which is you're almost slowing the conversation down a tad where part of the reason the other person is tempted to flee the call, which is what you were doing, Arman, by, like, giving so much resistance is, like, you feel that sales pressure. And when you can take twelve seconds and bring the pace down and let them feel a tad more in control, I feel like you actually buy yourself an immense amount of time. I don't know if that's something you you give me a thumbs up, so I'm assuming that dynamics apply. What I've noticed and, actually, there's some friends of mine that the guys that coached me actually there, we have a meeting, guys. I can jump on if you you guys you guys probably know them. They they have a band they have a lead yeah. They're they're fantastic. So they have a lead gen company. They have a ton of data. And interestingly, they work UK, US specifically. And what they notice is that the call calls that are above six minutes have the highest likelihood of turning into deals. And instead, what we see, especially in North America, is this idea that you need to be as quick as possible. And I think you guys probably have this from your clients. Like, they are desperate. Oh my god. Like, Saturated is so shit. Yeah. Because you're trying to book a meeting in two and a half minutes. Then someone says yes, and it by the time the meeting comes, they don't remember what it is about. So they're gonna just dodge that. Right? So I think this the slowing down and trying to have a bit of a long conversation, it just further increase the chances of that meeting happening and that meeting being relevant. That's that's why I think it's so important to slow it down. So we have the pitch, which you called using the language of them bitching at the coffee machine. You have Yeah. Coffee machine. That's it. Acknowledging acknowledging the objection, and then you have getting consent or getting permission. The last step that you wrote down was, I think, scripting all of your explorative questions. Is that the final step of handling objections? It's correct. And the way our ability just to make it a bit more memorable because we're lazy people is, like, accept consent, explore. So ace ace your objections. Right? It's easy to remember this way. This is probably the part that most people get wrong is the reason why I can propose the role play is because there isn't an objection you're gonna give me that I'm not gonna have an answer for. Right? Because the the objections, guys, like, just it's all of them. Right? It's like there's, like, 10 objections. They come in slightly different dress, but it's all of them. Right? And so once you know out of two, three, four, five responses, then you're good. So the point is, like, what you want now is you typically want a question. This is important. Like, I don't like open questions on cold calls. And a bunch of old school sales trainers are gonna be like, oh my god. Like, you're asking only close question. What the hell is wrong with you? Are you crazy? And the reason is very simple is that an open question, a good supplier, you know, and you go like, oh, what do you like about your supplier? You know, that implies a very long conversation, which then the prospect is gonna be like, 12, can I be arsed doing this? I don't I don't wanna do this right now. So instead, I'd rather go with something that can buy me a bit more time. So with you, I said, like, so you decided to never look at another supplier again? Mhmm. So I'm first challenging like, I'm just exploring a little bit. Like, are you that married? And most likely, you're not gonna be. And I'm typically asking a little bit cheeky, like, direct leading questions to open them up a little bit. And then I can I can follow-up with more concrete questions later? Like, the email is like, is that a polite way to tell me to go away? I wanna make sure. Is it? And if you tell me yes, I'm gonna be like, okay. So my pits really didn't miss the mark, or you generally don't have these problems. So, again, I'm just trying to get the other prospect to commit a bit more without going crazy deep. Right? And so I I you can map out this very easily. Once you you know how to do the generic, then you go into the real crazy stuff. So for me, when someone tells me send me an email, my easiest one is, like, is it a test? And they'll be like, what do you mean? Well, I'm a sales trainer. Are you testing me by ask by giving this objection? Right. And then they go like, well, no. Maybe. Or, you know, I'll be like, oh, okay. So would you be happy if you're a salesperson one of your salespeople just send an email when they were asked to? And they'll be like, but we're not. So so you see but I'm a sales trainer. That's that taters to me. Right? And so, like, when, for example, you let's say, your accountant, taxes. So they'll go like, oh, you know, I think I'm good. Oh, okay. Look. That's very good. Glad to hear that. Can I ask a question? Yeah. When you say you're good, does that mean that last year, you you got your full $17 back from this tax submission. And they might go like, what? Yeah. You know? Like, that no. I I didn't I didn't know. Oh, your accountant didn't tell you? And and I mean right? And the most specialized UI in your product, the more you can craft this really tactical question. And you'll get to the point you sell Salesforce. You'll know exactly what to ask to HubSpot users Mhmm. To try and find a chink in the armor. And so so once you do this, then apart of the fact that you can reuse all of this into your discovery calls, so you're building, like, a crazy amount of value there. But, also, you just come up out any single objection on the planet, and you nothing scares you anymore. See, this is the mistake that a lot of sellers make is they think that you need to treat a cold call like a discovery call, which is a lot of people, they'll give their pitch, and then they'll end their pitch with a question like, so how are you doing this thing today? Mhmm. And the problem is you haven't earned the right to ask big open ended questions yet. With a close ended question, your goal is not to expand their entire world. In your words, it's to pry one chink in the armor. It is just to poke one hole in how they're doing things today. And that will give you the right to ask a bigger question because you've exposed the fact that there might be a bigger problem. But if you just go into, like, la la neverland of, like, big open ended questions at the beginning, the person's gonna be like, this person knows nothing about my business. I don't even see this as a problem. I don't even see this as a question worth answering in the first place. So the question always has to take a guess at the problem they have knowing that sometimes you will be wrong, but that is just part of the game is if you are wrong, sometimes that might mean you either have to buy yourself permission to ask for another problem, or you might realize that that's not the prospect that has the problem that you're looking for, and it might not be a good fit. But you're better off in that situation than getting rejected for every open ended question that you try to ask. Cold calling is a game of percentage points. Right? And and I just wanna become as good as possible to have the highest percentage. I'm not saying that going with, hey. Hello. How are you? And whatever. And it's you can still book meetings depending on your tone and a bunch of things. But if I need to have the scientifically, psychologically best way, then that's how I'm gonna build it out. So we started this episode talking about objections. I wanna give a couple more common objections to you. My first one is what what do you do if someone hangs up on you? I mean, look. Typically, the easiest solution is you call them back. Like, did did we disconnect? But let's be honest, a lot of the time, they don't pick up the phone again. But Mhmm. I think it's 20% by the time they pick up again. And Yeah. And so it's worth a try. But, yeah, that's that's and the other thing I do with that, obviously, I swear and I cry and all of that stuff, but that that's not very useful for sales training purposes. Let's go with another common one. Someone might say, like, look. You you guys are way too expensive. Okay. I'm I appreciate you giving this opinion. And I'm not I'm not agreeing to it. I can't really agree to that because Mhmm. It's a negative thing about me. Right? Uh-huh. I appreciate you might think that way. You know? You guys say it's not the first time I hear it. And then I'm gonna be like, do you mind if I ask something really direct? But I don't wanna offend you. You see, I'm really loading it. I'm really loading it. Right? And you're gonna be like, yeah. God. Oh, you can't offend me. So when you say we're really expensive, does that mean that pricing is your first priority? Right? And what I've done now is, like, I've no one wants to be cheap. Right? So 90% of the time, they'll be like, well, no. It's about value. If they say yes, they can fuck off because then they'll they'll buy from somewhere else that's got it cheaper. Right? Right? Simple. But if they then I'll be like, well, no. It it it depends on the value. And then it's gonna be like, okay. So when you and then I can go into exploration. So when you're telling me value, are you saying that you currently feel you get everything you have and everything that's perfect for the price you pay? And so I break it down further, and they'd be like, well, I think it's pretty good. Okay. Pretty good. What's gonna make it perfect? You know? And then I'm going from, like, we say pretty good. What is in a scale of one to 10? You can't say seven. And then it'll be like, eight. Okay. Eight. One or six. Again, go the other way. Well, because they do these things well. Okay. Well, we'll make it a 10. Well, this and this. Okay. So if we make sure we could do could get you those two things to a 10. So you're still saying that wouldn't be worth paying, what, $400 more? Well, it depends. We need to look at a case study and blah. Okay. Look. It sounds like you're not completely against this. If the right man is there, would it be a terrible idea to, and then you set a meeting. That's one. Another one very simple. When's the last time that you bought something really cheap and you thought, wow. That was great. And then they go, oh, but it's not really cheap. I was like, well, but you see the problem I'm making. You know? Like, I typically I lean into it. I'm like, well, you're expensive. Isn't that a good thing? But yeah. So there's so many ways to to handle this. And, typically, like, I I find I don't know if you guys have this a lot, but there's something go wrong if you get the expensive during the cold because it been it means you've been talking too much about yourself. Why have you got talking about pricing on the cold? Like, I can't remember the last time I talked about pricing on Coke. I I will, but if that's me, what's the price? I'd be like, oh, are you asking me that now because that's the top priority? Oh, no. No. I'm not saying that. I just wanna have an idea. It's like, and then you can go into the usual I'm happy to give you a ballpark, blah blah blah, whatever. But, yeah, I would I think that typically is a red flag if that's coming up too much. Let's do one more. So this one's around, like, if they're they're like, oh, this is a busy time of year. We, you know, we don't have any bandwidth. So they might say something like, well, look. I appreciate the call. We just have so much going on right now. We're planning for sales kickoff. We've got a couple initiatives going, but, like, you know, maybe reach back out in the future when things aren't as crazy. Kyla, I'm, of course, I'm happy to do that. Can I be a little bit challenging here? I mean, you've already interrupted my day, so keep the challenge going, I guess. So are you ever not busy? You know, we're a we're a hypergrowth company. There's a lot going on. So, yeah, we do have a lot going on. But, I mean, this is a particularly busy time of year for us, q one. If I were to say this is not a problem at all, that's fine. So if you tell me this is completely not priority, that's okay. But, otherwise, is it likely you're gonna sit three months from now and think, damn, I wish I did something about that earlier? Right? So I'm trying to loop you back to, like and, again, I can't really change their mind. I just need to understand, is this a priority or not? Actually, a very simple way is like, are you gonna kick yourself in three months wishing you acted sooner? It's a very simple way of doing it. And just trying to to get them back in, basically. There's one really small thing that I've noticed throughout this interview that I actually think is one of the most powerful pieces of why you're so damn good at objection handling. No matter what I say, you follow it with this one, two step punch. Step one is you take a beat. You take a moment, and I can see you think for a second. And then you say, okay. And I think you do that to show me as the recipient on the cold call, I'm still here. I didn't just go totally silent, and I'm listening to what you're saying. And that ends up getting you two beats to think through what you're gonna say next. Because even someone who's experienced as you we didn't preplan what these role plays are gonna be. You have to give yourself an inch of space to think. And you do it with take a quick pause, and you say, okay. And it's a little thing, but I bet if more folks listening to this would implement that, they would be able to come up with witty, snappy, funny responses. The problem is I think a lot of salespeople think they have to respond immediately or the call's gonna go away, and you actually do that to buy yourself some time. I think it's really subtle but very powerful. Absolutely. I think the pause is what a lot of people miss out on is they're just trying to they have decided that if they don't speak very quickly, they're gonna hang up. It's like, look. They're talking. They gave an objection. They already had the hang up option. They didn't take it. Yeah. So you're not you're not dead. So you should be, as much as you can, trying to be still. Today's show is brought to you by Texas, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, Julio. The clock is ticking. We're running out of time, so we gotta move to the final question. The final question is this biggest objection handling mistake you see most salespeople make. I mean, it's actually super simple. Is it they're just not prepared. Like, I you know, you you see sometimes people argue LinkedIn scripting or not scripting. I would never recommend anyone that's not masterful to not have a script. And, like, I was actually having a session today with my academy, and I was like, guys, like, if you're junior, what you do is that you pick this week, I'm gonna work on this objection, and you just focus on that. And then when when you respond the three full times, you know, you're good, Then you do the next thing. You do the next. In three months, you've done 12 objections. You're good. Right? At that point, you are very, very powerful as a as a cold caller. So yeah. Alrighty, folks. It's time for a three step recap and one thing you could do. Alright. Three step recap. It was the a c e method for handling objections. So number one, you need to accept or acknowledge the objection. Don't just barrel through it. Don't just pitch through it. Acknowledge that you've heard the objection. And if it's a brush off, you might even choose to challenge it upfront with humor. That's number one. Number two, before you handle the objection, you wanna get consent. That is the seat. That usually means you ask permission to ask a direct question. And lastly, number three is you want to explore the objection. You want to ask a close ended question that is sometimes a little bit ridiculous. The example that Julio gave when I said send me an email is he was like, hey. Is the reason that you want an email because your inbox doesn't have enough of them inside of it already? And that naturally got me to laugh, but it also called out the ridiculousness of my objection. So a, c, e, accept consent, explore objections. Alrighty, Nick. What's one thing people can do? Julio talked about this at the end. The way that you become a masterful objection handler is you pick one objection every single week, and you just focus on that. Over the course of a quarter, you will master 12 objections. And at that point, you're pretty much good for whatever gets thrown at you. If you want a starting point for objection handling best practices and scripts, you can steal ours. We put together a guide that is in today's show notes of the 18 most common objections that you'll encounter on a cold call and 30 MPC approved scripts to overcome each. Check it out on the show notes. Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week on the show. That's a wrap, folks.
