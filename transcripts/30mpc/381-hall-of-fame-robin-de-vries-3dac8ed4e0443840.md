## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to a very special episode of thirty minutes to president's club with one of the best sellers we've ever had. This person hit a 178% of their number and got awarded rep of the year at MongoDB while taking three months out of the year for paternity leave. We've got Robin at MongoDB. He is a senior high-tech account executive and team lead. Jen, why should people listen? First of all, I don't think I've ever laughed as much as I did on this episode of thirty minutes to president's club, so it's a damn joy. But number two is because you do not hit an annual target in nine months by being lazy at prospecting. Robin gave great tactical tips on how you approach prospecting. If you sell into engineering, this is an even much better lit episode for you to listen into. And we also taught you what to do with video prospecting if you're ugly. So stay tuned. This will really help for folks like me. A three, a two, a one, roll the tape. Alright, Robin. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Alright. So my first one is align your sales process with your customer's buying process. So I feel like way too often, we get into sales conversations. We try and force everybody down the same path that we've done like over and over and over. But after your initial discovery, you've uncovered some pain needs or goals you agree to solve. You should really start uncovering how your customer likes to or needs to buy. Not every customer is the same that way. So what do they still need to see? What do they need to test? Who else is involved? And start mapping that process out like way, way, way before you expect to get signature can really start speeding up your deals. Beautiful. What's number two? Number two, you need to have a weekly target for discovery meetings, not just a quarterly, not just a yearly goal for new logos. But if you work backwards from your annual target numbers, you're always gonna feel like you're behind. If you start planning week in, week out, you will be ahead. You'll be planning. You'll be playing to win. It will be a lot, lot sharper. So for me, I knew that I had three months of paternity leave coming up at the end of the year. Wanted to make sure that I still hit my numbers. Not something my company makes me do, but I wanted to do it for my own. Good. So I knew that I had to get 10 new logos, but I had to do it in nine months. How do I do it? Work backwards week in, week out on targets that I set. So instead of five discovery meetings, I needed to have seven, for example. Build everything out to win instead of to lose. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Love it. Round us out, Robin. What's number three? So number three is you need to be self sourcing your accounts. Like, sure, you'll get a book from sales ops. Not everything is going to be great in there. You really need to do your job, like, on sourcing those accounts. Look through Built In. Look through WellFound. Look through LinkedIn. Look through career pages. Start building a POV on what accounts are great accounts and how you can help additional accounts. Look through what deals have been closed on the floor and what accounts are similar that you can source yourself. Add those to your book. There'll be a lot higher quality than what is in your book to begin with. Amazing. So, Robin, you're not the type to brag, but I'm the type to brag, and I'm gonna brag for you. You hit a 178% of your number and won rep of the year at MongoDB despite being out for three months out of that year because you were on paternity leave. Congratulations for a number of different reasons there. One of the things you told me on the preshow was you knew that you were gonna have this pat leave, and you knew you had to put your foot on the gas to get to goal and even beyond? And you said prospecting was one of the biggest things that impacted that. I wanna go to one of your takeaways, which was you have this book of accounts that you get from sales ops, but there are other companies that you are able to sell to. And so one of the things that you did was you spent some time finding accounts that weren't necessarily in the list that you got from sales ops because you knew they were really, really good fits. And so I'm wondering if you can define, one, what are some of the things you were looking for that would make you say, oh, this company is a good fit for MongoDB? And then two, where did you actually go look to find this stuff? I know you mentioned stuff like careers pages, built in, etcetera. But I'm wondering if you can give the audience a sense of, like, the targeting that you did and then where you went to find that stuff. Yeah. Sure. So we we're a pretty technical seal. I'm not very technical, but we work in the database, like, back end back end technology. So we have a product that is very it's it's open source. Anybody can download, and we don't really necessarily have a record of who's downloading it. So it's on us as salespeople to find who is actually using this. And the product free is great, but what we sell is a managed version of it. So what we're looking for is people that are using our free version that are going through, like, some growing event, like scaling, building out go to market organization, really hiring more engineers. So what I'm looking for is people that are leveraging, like, our open source version, but that have an event like, Hey, they're growing, they're scaling, they're going to market. They're going to have issues self managing or self hosting everything. So that was number one. And where I look for things like this, like, we sell to engineers. They are not ones to have a ton of information on their careers page. But, hey, if you look at past employees, people tend to throw so much stuff in their, like, LinkedIn bios for past jobs that we would look at past employees like, hey, who has left the Oregon? Let's call that this whole tech stack that they're working with and issues they dealt with, projects they worked on. That is a main tool that I would use to find accounts that have that have some Mongo and that are going through those events, that are scaling, that are hiring more people. LinkedIn pages is one built in, well found. Their own careers pages, like, what kind of engineering skills they're hiring for. Those are all tools that we would use to really, like, scrape and find those accounts that either have Mongo or would have technology that plays really well with it. So I think one of the things that I struggle with as a sales rep a lot, and as I'm hearing you talk about the sources you're going to is sometimes when we do that, we have a great reason for reaching out. Right? We've got really solid context. What do you do in the message itself? And I don't care what how you're doing. If it's cold call messaging or cold email, whatever the case may be, what channel it may be? How do you bring to life why you're reaching out to them now? So let's say let's take one of your examples. I loved the idea around looking at people who are former employees who tend to put a lot more information because they're putting it on their resume. Like, what would you do with that information when it comes to crafting your message? It's pretty interesting. Like, those people actually still wanna talk to you about their past roles. So you can actually call them and, like, hey. You were you were here, like, six months ago. Why did you leave? Like, we'd love to see if there's, like, anything that I can learn from you, and you can use that to start building your POV. But what I would do with that information is take that up to the higher ups, the CTO, VP of engineering, and say, hey. Notice your team has done x y z, but you're still using an older technology or something that really isn't set up to skill, especially with AI now coming in. It's really changing, like, people's whole tech stack because it needs to be super flexible, super unstructured. There's just there's a lot of change happening right now. But if we can have an opinion on what they're currently doing and we know where the market is going, all the changes that are happening, I think we can bring a really strong opinion to leadership. And at the same time, have, like, conversations with their current or past engineers around sharpening that POV, like bringing it to them, saying, hey. I'm seeing this. Is that accurate? Are you guys doing this? Are you aware of this? Are you using that? And then take that up the food chain again. Robin, I wanna ask you about this past employees thing again. I spend a lot of time on LinkedIn, and Jen said to me the other day, she spends even more time on LinkedIn. I am wondering if you have an efficient way to find past employees at companies, if there's, like, a filter you're using or a really easy way to get that stuff. Because I can imagine there's a way to spend hours and hours and hours just clicking through pages and profiles. It's super easy. It's just a Sales Nav filter. You can click past company, select your company, see all the leads that used to work there. You open a couple that, like, kinda fit the titles that you're looking for, and there's typically a ton of gold there. Okay. So I wanna ask you about it can sometimes be really challenging to manage deals, which is something you were doing. You were closing deals and also fit in prospecting. And so I'm wondering, when you were looking at that nine months that you had to hit your number and beyond, how did you structure your days and weeks? I have, like, time blocking that I use, but I think the biggest focus for us for me, really, was on Friday, I would build a PG plan for the next week, already source all the accounts that I was gonna go after and my top targets at these accounts and a POV on, like, why I was actually reaching out to those accounts. So on Fridays, I started organizing my week that was coming ahead, and I would start time blocking already on Friday so that I would have time slots in my week ready to make sure that I had PG pipeline generation on, like, the forefront, everything that I was gonna be doing. Sure. There's gonna be customer calls that overlap, but at least that way, I had a ton of time already set aside to make sure that I wasn't falling behind. Before I ask this question, just to give context, how many accounts on average like, when you talk about that weekly planning, like, how many accounts on average are you looking at in one particular week to start generating pipeline? About five or six with about five to 15 contacts at each account or, like, my veto is, like, my most focused outreach. Perfect. So every week, you're looking at five to six potentially new or different accounts. Mhmm. One of the things I often certainly struggle with it as a seller, is you do a lot of upfront high value work, it sounds like, to develop a point of view, bring that to the first call, email, whatever the case may be. What happens after the first one? Like, what how do you think about following up your, like, cadence, whatever the case may be? How do you approach that? After the first touch, I'd like, really, I do everything with sequencing. We use Outreach. We use SalesLoft now. So my first touch is just the beginning, but I start on LinkedIn typically with the LinkedIn touch. I send a ton of LinkedIn videos, which actually is very helpful to have really quick, easy conversations and start building that POV more. But everybody pretty much is in, like, fully outbound sequences that are, like, very customized. We do emails, calls, LinkedIn touches, whatever. All of it. All the time. How many prospects do you have in sequence at any given time? I would say about 60 on average on, like, my fully customized sequence and then probably some for, like, events that are coming up, but they're not really sequenced. But, like, my high value targets, I would say about 60 at any given time. And then of those 60, how many of them are at the same company? Because it sounds like you're pulling multiple contacts for any given account. Yeah. It's probably between five to 15 would be the highest, but five to 10 on average. The mix of the seniority of those five to 15. Are they all c suite? Are you reaching out to the engineering intern? What does that mix of contacts look like? I would say those contacts are all director and up. Most of my organizations that I'm reaching out to have a ton of engineers, and I'll do mostly just LinkedIn for those. I'll send them a LinkedIn connection request and a video because that takes me literally thirty seconds on my phone. I'm just, like, recording a little video on my phone, and sending it over and just having a conversation because I really use the like, the more engineers will use them. But I like having conversations with them to really build my POV a lot stronger and understand what they're actually running into. But the people that will get like something done about the POV are those director level and up. So that's where I really spent my time sequencing. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Okay, Robin. I gotta go back to something you said, which everybody knows that LinkedIn is only good if you're selling to salespeople. You're selling to engineers. How are you making this possible? How are you sending videos to engineers and getting them to reply? I love the fact that you said this because you're hitting on a big misconception about LinkedIn. So tell us, what do you think makes it work and how do you approach those videos? Everybody uses LinkedIn. Like, engineers use it, product uses it, Product actually might even use it more than sales. Product teams are very active on, like, new releases that they're pumping out. Like, I love talking with the product managers about what they're actually doing. I just I keep it super short. I feel like everybody's gonna open anything that I sent them on their cell phone. So I record from my cell phones. I was native. It just looks like somebody's actually talking to them. I just keep it short, keep it very conversational, and that's how I have had success with engineers on LinkedIn. Okay. So what's short to you? Is it fifteen seconds? Oh, like, twenty seconds. Okay. And then do you send just the video? Do you send text a text piece with it? What does that look like? Yeah. I feel like I started sending only the video, and people were like, what are you sending me? This is spam or like a virus or something. I don't know. So I sent my video and then a little text like, hey, first name. Thank you for connecting. Wanted to send a quick video, like, why I reached out. What sort of tech are you using to send the video? Are you using just like native LinkedIn video? Do you use a different tool? Different tool? I use the camera app on my iPhone. I have a note in front of me of who I'm talking to. Do 30 videos in a row. Just hit record, record, record, and then send them all through LinkedIn mobile. I love that tip in particular because it brings me all the way back to one of our very first 30 MPC episodes with James Bodden, where he actually gave the same advice, which is use the native LinkedIn video as opposed to sending them out to a different video link because LinkedIn will be like, you're leaving LinkedIn. Are you sure this is safe? And people are already skeptical enough and suspicious enough of getting phished. When you have the native one, it's a lot easier for them to actually view. And especially engineers. Like, people in security, people in engineering, they're not gonna click on any links. You gotta send them just an actual video. Now the interesting thing about video is if you're ugly like me, no one's gonna respond to you. You don't get And I've seen people do different things to get their prospects to open the video and actually be like, oh, this is meant for me. The good news, Robin, is you're not as ugly as me, and don't even get me started on Armand. Are you doing anything interesting with the video thumbnail? Do you have a whiteboard that says their name? It sounds like you're batching these videos. So I'm curious if you're doing anything special with the visual element of the video. No. I I feel like that all just takes way too much time. Like, I I don't wanna do any of that. But, like, a tip, if you are ugly, I don't think you are, Nick, by the way, but you could hold the sign in front of your face that might work or something. I can only imagine. I'm talking about the dead. I'm interested in I'm interested in booking a meeting with your company. I hope you're well in these dangerous and unprecedented times. That is easily the funniest tip I've ever heard since we've been on the show. Oh my gosh. That's an actionable takeaway. Right? Oh, we're keeping this in the episode. You better believe it. Jen, I hope you have a good question to ask to keep going. I mean, not as good as that tip. How do you follow that? But I guess one of my questions is, what does the end of your videos typically sound like? Are you asking for anything? What's the last five seconds sound like? Last five seconds is let me know if that's something that you're working with and if it makes sense to connect on that. Like, I I keep it very, very soft. I don't feel like LinkedIn is a hard close, like, schedule thirty minutes with me tomorrow type of place. It's conversational. So I wanna keep it as conversational as possible. And if I struck a court, can we schedule a couple minutes to chat about it? One question I wanna ask you, Robin. I presume one of the more effective ways to get the attention of hard to reach prospects in your space is like industry events, trade shows, conferences, and things of those nature. And I'm wondering if you've got any best practices related to prospecting related to those. Yeah. Those are super helpful, especially for open source software, like, really product led organizations because there's so many more people that wanna go to big events that you might have never realized that actually use your platform. So for me, what has been very successful is I will literally pull huge LinkedIn reports of who is all in the region that we have a thing called dot local. That is in the region that we have a dot local coming up that calls out the skill of using MongoDB. And I'll batch all of those in Outreach, and you'll get way more responses to that than, like, just your cold, hey. Can we talk about Mongo? But, hey. No. We're actually coming to your city. I know that you've been using it. Would love to have you there and set you up with some engineering resources to make sure that everything is going well. That is something that has been very, very helpful. You would see people there that you don't have that you've never realized that actually use your platform, especially for open source software companies. To what extent are you, like, personalizing that or is the event itself enough? Can you copy paste what marketing gives you or are you tailoring that in any way? I work with a completely greenfield book. Like, I'm an acquisition. I don't do, like, account management, anything like that. And for me, it I don't personalize it a lot. Like, those messages because I don't know that they're necessarily doing something with MongoDB. I'm just looking for people that have the skill and that are in the area, and it's hundreds of people. I I can't personalize all of that. Yeah. No. It's a good call out. Like, it's I I think oftentimes we talk about personalization as something you do or don't do, but what I like is what you talked about before is in your LinkedIn messages, those feel more personalized. In your initial first touch outreach, those feel more personalized. But I think where people get into trouble is when you try to personalize every single touch along the way. And I like the way that you think about events as valuable enough because people want to come together that that can be enough weight in those messages. Yeah. I think as long as we have a good reason to reach out to them, that's really what we need. An event is a good reason. I agree. I mean, you're right. I think, obviously, it depends on your number of accounts you have, segment space, type of sale, etcetera. But I think folks sometimes over rotate on the personalization and will double personalize where it's like, I need to research you and personalize this email, and we're both gonna be at this trade show or event. When I was selling to law firms, I would have the most success with the subject line of, like, Ilticon, which was the International Legal Technology Association conference, and that would be the subject line. And it would be like, I'm gonna be there. I think you're gonna be there. Here's why I wanna talk to you, which was relevant, not personalized. And I would book meetings. People were like, I'm going to this thing to meet with vendors and meet with peers. Cool. Great. It was easy, and it was faster. And I appreciate even the thing you said earlier about videos, Robin, where it's like, okay. I might have a half a percentage increase by holding a whiteboard that says, hello, Jen. But if that's taking you an extra forty five seconds to neatly write Jen's name, I have horrendous handwriting as you can see. Like, that's gonna slow you down and you're actually better off not doing that, and so I appreciate you sharing that stuff. Jen mentioned earlier, oh, there's a lot of people out there that say LinkedIn doesn't work when you sell to engineers. And I bet there's also a lot of people that say, cold calling. You can't cold call an engineer. Those people never pick up the phone. And I actually don't know. And I'm curious what your experience has been with cold calling in your space. You can definitely call. I have noticed that a lot of people have those, like, the Google screener where, like, you have to, like, say why you're calling. Yeah. That happens a lot. But, like, it's kind of nice working for a company that is very well recognized among engineers. But you can say, I'm Robin with Mongo, and they will see that typed out on their screen immediately. And we see quite often that people will actually take the call. But it really depends. Some people will take a call. A lot of people will not. But cold calling is most definitely not dead for engineers, and neither is LinkedIn. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. So I actually wanna ask you about that Google screen where it's like, I've run into that a lot where it's it's actually funny since Jen started co hosting 30 MPC. I started calling her all the time just to, like, talk about life and bond. And I noticed after a couple weeks of her co hosting, she added a Google screen. And when I call it and I try to call Jen, it goes in a very AI voice, hello. Please state your name after the tone, and Google Voice will try to connect you. And now every time I say, hey. It's Nick. How you doing, Jen? Seems I go to voice mail. What do you say when you get that Google Voice prompt? Do you just say your name and your company? Do you include information about why you're calling? What's your approach there? Yeah. Both. I would state my name, company, and, like, a one line POV on why I call. But I do the same. Right? As soon as I see that it's, like, my VP, Kyle, calling me for another deal update, I let it go to voice mail right away. But if I know that it's, like, someone that actually is calling me back, for example, I'll take the call. That was hilarious. I don't even know how to follow that. Oh, and I'll be honest. I'm thrown. That was so sneaky and subtle. So let's say they take your call. They answer to Google Voice. How do you typically open your cold calls, Robin? I I go straight for my POV. Hey. I know it caught you out the blue. Thank you for taking my call, by the way. But I noticed your company is doing x y z. You just got funding to scale. Notice you're using a SQL solution that we have seen historically that makes it very difficult. Is that something that you're running into? And I'll just open it like that. I never ask, hey. Do you have a minute or two? Mhmm. Nobody ever does. You get hung up on immediately. But if you lead with your, like, your POV, they'll try to correct you very often. Like, it seems like from the outside that this is maybe happening. People have a tendency to wanna correct you. So I really like just leading with why I'm actually calling, and I will think about that for every person that I call. Like, why what am I gonna say if this person picks up? What is my value that I provide? That's what I try to think of. That's what I lead with. Can you give me an example of what a POV might sound like? Hey. Noticed that you just got funding. It was called out that you're looking to scale your platform and launch three new applications. Also notice that your team has been using a SQL solution that can make it very difficult to actually build new applications upon that existing data and can be very costly to scale. Is that something that you're running into at all? And how are you how how is your team looking to solve? Dang. That is so what I love about that is the specificity. You could have just stopped at sentence one. Like, I noticed you got funding and then went right into a solution pitch, but it's you really subtly showed, like, I have I did my homework. I showed up with a reason. I love the way you did that without bragging about how you found it and where you found it. It just sounded so conversational. I my biggest piece of advice I got on day day one in sales, starting as a BDR for a mobile company called MobileIron that's no longer around. And it was another BDR starting on day one as well, one of my really good friends now. And he said sales is just people talking to people, and that has been my guiding principle since day one. I just wanna have a conversation with people. Like, I wanna understand, like, why it actually matters what they're trying to do, but I'm not super technical. I don't, like, really wanna get into the weeds. I just wanna understand, are you having issues, and can I help solve them? Well, I'm having issues. I got a lot. And one of my issues is that we are running out of time here, Robin, and so we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta flip that question on a TED and ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break, shatter, throw in the trash because it is hurting them more than it helps? I think over rotating on activity. Like, we have all these leaders that are just asking how many dials are you making? How many emails are you making? It makes no difference. As long as you can, like, really do your research on who you're calling, you're gonna have way better results if you know why they should answer the phone, why they should talk to you than if you're just, like, spamming 300 people. Just be focused on who you actually wanna talk to and why you wanna talk to them instead of the amount of calls, the volume. Focus on the quality. There needs to be some volume. But if the quality is there, you're gonna have a way higher success rate. Amazing. Robin, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode with Robin. Number one, when you are looking for intel around an account, don't neglect looking at the LinkedIn profiles of past employees. Those folks often include details around their tech stack and big initiatives that they helped complete. And so you can actually learn more from past employees sometimes than current employees. Number two. If you're just not the best looking person in the world like myself and you're very anxious about your video prospecting, get yourself a whiteboard and record your videos with the whiteboard covering your face. That way the prospect will might even agree to a meeting. And then when they show up on the discovery call, you might have to pull a camera off things, say, oh, sorry. I've got bad Internet. Okay. That one's a joke. But in all seriousness, don't waste time with the old whiteboard thing that says, hey, Jen. That was a great shtick about five years ago. It's overused, and it will slow you down without really helping your video response rate. Response rate. Number three, on the same topic of personalization, don't overdo it. I love the way that Robin talked about that personalization is having a good reason to reach out. If you have an event in the area where they have the opportunity to meet with other similar roles, that might just be on its own a good enough reason to reach out. We don't have to do overkill and eat into our productivity. And number four, LinkedIn outreach. Don't believe the hype. Just because you sell into engineering or product does not mean that you cannot use LinkedIn as a channel. I love the way that Robin talked about using video outreach on LinkedIn to immediately connect with folks in engineering and product roles. Now, Nick, what can our listeners do to help thirty minutes to Presidents Club out today? Well, I feel like Robin dispelled a lot of myths that people have that hold them back when it comes to prospecting into a very technical buyer. Talked about cold calling those folks. He talked about how he's using LinkedIn. And so if you work in a technical sale to a technical buyer and you learn things from this incredible top performer that you'd like your sales work to implement, send this episode to some folks on your team. Share it with them because it's a lot more fun to cold call when you've got the whole team cold calling as opposed to you locking yourself in the corner office and making cold calls while everybody else just sends emails and says, well, I'm gonna wait for inbound. So share this with your team. Let them know that this stuff does work, and we'll see you next week on thirty minutes of president's club.
