## Transcript

There we are. The doors are open. Welcome aboard, everybody. For the people who are lagging, we're gonna wait two minutes so you can enjoy everybody's favorite theme song, and I have a question for you. Favorite TV show childhood theme song? Put it in the chat right there. Nick, I'm putting you on the spot. Did you have a a favorite childhood TV show? You strike me as a Yes. And a guy. No. No. It's the Pokemon theme song. My now wife, I got married last weekend, and I were driving recently. And I found one of my old iPods, and I plugged it into my car, and I made her listen to all of my, like, old music. And the Pokemon theme song, actually an instrumental of the Pokemon theme song popped up, and I made her listen to the whole thing. Honestly, who watched the Pokemon movie? Put a one in the chat. You pop watched the Pokemon movie as a kid, and you cried in the movie theater. You know when they turn ash into stone, you're crying every single time. Alrighty, folks. In a three, two, one. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this live book summary of thirty minutes the president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I am here with my cohost, CoGoon, cofounder, and now coauthor, Nick Seagalski. If you are not familiar with our stuff, we have a ton of faces who are new in the room. I, by background, was a VP of sales at a company called Pave, and I led them from 0 to $10,000,000 in ARR in two years. And Nick was a multiple time, a three time number one enterprise seller selling 6 and 7 figure deals. And together, we run the number one sales podcast out there, thirty minutes to Presidents Club with a couple million downloads per year. And, folks, today, the reason that you all showed up is we are asking you to spend the single most valuable resource that you have in the world in sales, which is your time. And so the first question we are going to answer for you all today is why in the world would you read another sales book at all in the first place? From there, we will very quickly jump into a summary of the book. And every single chapter, we will summarize the key takeaways, and you will have screenshots throughout the book so you can get a sense of what's inside. And then lastly, number three, because we're basically going to be giving you all the takeaways from the book, we're gonna give you the craziest discount you've ever seen in your life because there probably won't even be a reason to buy the book anymore. And so that's what we're covering, folks. A couple of quick reminders. Number one, this will be recorded, and we will send you the on demand recording after this. Someone's will still ask me if this will be recorded. Yes. Please help me out with that in the chat. Number two, we are gonna try to cover all the q and a at the end. Normally, we would do that throughout the session, but we really want this to be a clean book summary chapter by chapter. So please put all of your questions in the q and a box. They will get lost in the chat. Put them in the q and a box, and we will cover some of those at the end. We'll actually stay on a little bit later toward the end of the session. Number three, pull out your phones. Throughout the session, there will be QR codes that you can scan to hear the tone of the talk tracks later on. And then lastly, number four, screenshots are highly encouraged. We are going to be showing you different pages of the book. It is okay to screenshot them, post them wherever you want, share them with friends, etcetera. It only helps us. Alrighty, folks. So let's jump in with the first question, Nick. Why in the world would we write a sales book when our our website literally says throw your three 400 page sales book in the trash? Right. There are literally thousands upon thousands of sales books out there, and you and I have read a lot of them. And the reality is most of them, to your point about throw your 400 page sales book in the trash, most of them are way too long, and they contain a cacophony of different random mindset tips, and you like that vocab. The cacophony. Random talk tracks here and there that don't really come in order. And they mostly say, hey. You just gotta make more calls. They're almost like a motivational seminar. And you get to the end of the book, and you're like, okay. I gotta go make some calls, and then you pick up the phone, and you don't know what to say. And so we wrote this book to be the most practical, actionable book on cold cold calling that breaks down step by step what to do, what to say, and how to sound on every single moment of a cold call. And so there are four promises to make this book the most actionable sales book you've ever read and certainly not a cacophony of sales tips. Number one, you have a step by step breakdown of every single step of the cold call with talk tracks for every step. So it's broken down really simply. It goes from the opener to the problem proposition, to the objections you get, to the gatekeepers you'll encounter, to the voice mails you'll leave, to how you plan your day, and how you ultimately optimize the conversion of your dials. It'll be mind numbingly obvious where you need to go throughout the book, and we're gonna show you that today in proof. Number two, so much of cold calling is not just what you're saying, but it's how you sound. It's how you say it. So throughout the book, you'll find QR codes that are sprinkled that you can scan and listen to the tone of the talk track so you can really get the delivery right. Number three, the amount of times that I have heard, will this work for my industry, is mind numbingly large. And so we've interviewed over 200 guests from top sales organizations out there who sold SaaS, real estate, insurance. I've sold everything from SaaS to insurance, to real estate, to vending machines as has Nick, and he sold in an antiquated legal software space, and he sells our sponsorships today. No matter what you sell, you will be covered. And then lastly, number four, we can be semi convincing, guys. But honestly, folks, you see a lot of garbage advice on LinkedIn that sounds really good when people are saying it confidently. But when you actually hear it on the phone, it sounds horrible in practice. And so this book, we partnered with Gong to back the advice with data from 300,000,000 cold calls to prove that this stuff works in the field. Alrighty, folks. So we're gonna jump in. Here's what we got. The first question we answer in the introduction is, why would you even cold call at all? Right. Is it even worth your time? And so we wanted to answer that question first. And what we did was we looked at the data with Gong, and we said, alright. If a salesperson makes an hour's worth of cold calls a day for a month straight, how many meetings do they book? And what we did was we looked at the data for the average rep, the fiftieth percentile rep. And we also looked at the data for the seventy fifth percentile rep. So the pretty good reps. Not the best in the world, not the masters on the phone, but folks who were pretty good. And what we saw was for the average salesperson, cold calling's a pretty crummy use of their time. The average salesperson dials for an hour a day and makes 800 dials, and they end up connecting with just about five and a half percent of the people that they call. So they get 43 live conversations. Of those 43 live conversations, they book meetings with a whopping two of them. An hour a day of work for a month straight for two meetings is not a good use of your time. But the story looks really, really different for the pretty good rep, that seventy fifth percentile rep. They spend the same amount of time dialing. They make 800 cold calls. But on those same number of dials, they connect live with more than twice as many people. They get a 106 people live on the phone, and we will get into some of the things that they do differently to increase their connect rate later in this session. Of those 106 people that they talk to, they book meetings with one in six of them, and so they end up getting team meetings from an hour's worth of work a day. But the story gets even more exciting, Armand, because the data from Gong also showed that when you cold call, even if you don't connect live, it almost doubles your cold email reply rate because your calls draw attention to your emails. And so an hour a day of work, 18 meetings, plus all of the extra responses you get on your cold emails make it extremely, extremely worth it. And you'll find today that it's actually not that hard to beat the average rep when the average rep is asking, did I catch you at a bad time? Or pitching in a way that sounds like a Billy Mays commercial. And so, folks, we are gonna break down how to beat the average in every single step of the cold call. So throughout the book, each section is divided as follows. First, you have to nail the first sixty seconds. That includes the way that you open a cold call and the way you describe the problem you solve, AKA problem prop. From there, the first sixty seconds give you access to the rest of the call, and that's where we'll cover the mister Miyagi method for handling any objection. But there are also things that will prevent you from getting objections at all, such as gatekeepers or voice mails. Once you're done with sections one and two, that includes everything you will say on the phones, but the reps who make it to president's club are the ones who are also doing the right activities off the phones. That includes on the same number of dials, they dial smart. They maximize their dial conversion by optimizing their connect rates, their set rates, and their show rates. And then they make more calls than anyone else as well by dialing at the right time of day, and they make sure that they plan to dial every single day, and they structure their calendar like a machine. But step one is opening and getting the conversation in the first place. So we're gonna cover three things. What openers to not use, why most cold calls are lost in the first thirty seconds, then we're gonna go through what's called the heard the name toss around opener, which is my personal favorite, and then we'll go through Nick's personal favorite, which is the tailored permission opener. Awesome. So let's put ourselves in the shoes of your prospect for a second. 99% of the cold calls that your prospect receive come from pretty crappy telemarketers. These are people that are just blindly dialing through the phone book, pitching anybody who answers on their extended car warranties or loan forgiveness packages. And for your prospect to entertain those people is a total waste of their time. If you want your cold call to succeed, you've got to differentiate from those people. If your prospect thinks you are like those other telemarketers, you're gonna get rejected. And so that starts with the first words that come out of your mouth, which is why we've got two band openers that we'll show you the data on in a second that are not successful because they get you instantly categorized as a telemarketer. The first one is, did I catch you at a bad time? This one instantly says, hey. I'm a salesperson. I wanna pitch you. Is now a good time? Folks, you're making a cold call. You're interrupting their day. Of course, it's a bad time. But this also puts you in a very inferior position to the prospect as if they would be gracious enough to spare just a morsel of their time. So throw that one in the trash. The other opener that is banned is, hey. How's your day going, or how are you doing today? When you lead with false pleasantries like this, it kicks the call off on a sort of disingenuous note. Recall a list of 52 CIOs trying to book a meeting with them not to inquire about their day, And I know it, you know it, and your prospect knows it. But the real reason this one fails is it's what every other seller says. So even if you truly care about their day, it doesn't matter because you sound the same as every other telemarketer. And so the only way for you to get out of that telemarketer stigma, out of that telemarketer bucket, is to lead with something that cannot be canned, that cannot be used by other cold callers, and that's a context first opener. So you'll see that we're gonna give you two context first openers. And you'll see that the difference between the two context first openers, the tailored permission opener and the heard the name tossed around opener massively outperform the canned openers of did I catch you at a bad time and how's your day going. So did I catch you at a bad time has a two point one five percent success rate. How's your day going? 7%. Tailored permission opener and heard the name tossed around opener each over 11% success rate. And the reason for that is even if there were a third better canned opener, like the permission based opener, that sounds like, hey, Nick. I know this is totally catching you off guard, but this is a cold call. Could I get thirty seconds to tell you why I called? And then you can totally hang up from there. The problem is if a canned opener becomes popular, if a prospect's heard it before, they're immediately gonna lump you in with every other telemarketer. So you have to lead with something about them, which means your opener cannot be canned. That starts with the heard the name tossed around opener. So here's how this works. So for the heard the name tossed around opener, your goal is for them to forget that it's a cold call. The way you're gonna do that is you're gonna show them that you work with other people in their space, and you're not a complete rando. And so you're gonna find something that your current customers have in common with your prospect. So for example, when I was selling compensation software at Pave, I would say, hey. We work with a few other Sequoia portfolio companies. They shared the same investor. Or in this example, when I was selling life insurance to partners of law firms, I would say, we work with a few other partners in the Skadden Downtown LA office. And so the opener sounds like this. And you can scan the QR code on the right here for a good tone example. Scan the one on the left for, like, a mediocre example. Alright? So it sounds like this. Hey, Bill. We work with a few other partners in the SCAD in LA office. It's Arman from Northwestern. Have you heard our name tossed around? Even if they haven't heard our name tossed around before, you'll usually get an answer that sounds like, well, no. How can I help you? And that's okay. And the reason for that is the entire demeanor of the call has changed because I didn't lead with my name, my company. I led with I work with other people that are similar to you in your office. So from there, to be clear, it doesn't matter if they've heard your name tossed around or not. 90% of the time, they will not have heard your name tossed around. I used this when I was a 20 year old, no name, selling insurance, and I used this when I was the ninth employee at Pave, and no one knew who we were. What matters is they know who your customer is, and that's the common thread. So if they say no, all you're gonna do is you need to act like they should have heard your name tossed around. So I'm gonna say, oh, I guess I'm not as popular as I thought. Well, Nick, the reason that I reached out is I work with a few other partners in the office and and then you drop into the problem you solve, which is the problem proposition. But in the off chance that they said yes, this is the beautiful part. You literally don't have to pitch. All you have to do is understand why they didn't move forward in the past. And so I'm gonna say, like, oh, well, normally, we'd be working with someone new like like you by now. I guess what'd you hear? That'll get you to the objection, and then you can just have a conversation around why they didn't move forward in the past as opposed to just regurgitating the same pitch that they've already heard. So, again, to recap three steps, you lead with context, then you introduce yourself, then you ask if they've heard your name tossed around. Alright. Next one. Right. So the next context first opener is called the tailored permission opener. And just like the heard the name tossed around opener, like, these are the contextual openers. Just like the heard the name tossed around opener, this one leads with context, but it actually differs in that it owns that it's a cold call. And so it sounds something like this. If I'm selling billing software to law firms and I'm calling CFOs of law firms, I'm gonna say something like this. Armond's my prospect. He answers, and he goes, hello? I'm gonna say, Armond, I just finished reading your press release about the new office opening in Tacoma. And I'm gonna be honest. This is a cold call, but it is a well researched one. And I'm wondering if I can get half a minute to share why that press release prompted me to call you, and then you can totally hang up on me if it doesn't make sense from there. What I'm doing here is I am opening I'm leading with the research that I did that made me call this person. Then I'm disarming them with honesty by owning that it's a cold call and telling them exactly what I want, half a minute to share why that press release made me call them. And then I'm using the fact that I led with context and disarm them with honesty as a way to gain permission to get to my pitch. And what you're not gonna do, you don't have to reinvent the context or the research for every single prospect that you call. My recommendation is you find things that you can easily find about your prospects that you can relate to what you sell. So when I sold billing software to law firms, I would look for, did that law firm announce that they won a case recently? Because almost all of them would, and I can relate the billing software to they need to collect money. Or do they open a new office? Okay. That usually adds billing complexity. I can attach that to my pitch. So you don't need to start from scratch with your leading with context with the TPO. You just need to think of your common, what can I find that I can relate to what I sell? So at this point, now you've got your two openers that you can use that get you to the part of the call where you have to give your pitch and explain what the heck you actually do. And there are three parts to breaking down what we call the problem proposition. Number one, why most value propositions and pitches that come from your whatever team are absolutely horrendous. Number two, how you should lead with a problem proposition instead. And then number three, once they've agreed that they have the problem that you solve, how do you ask them for the meeting? Alrighty. Billy Mays time. Beautiful. So most salespeople have been trained that the key to being a really, really great seller is to have a great pitch, sometimes known as a value proposition. And their value propositions that most folks use sound something like, yeah. You know, Ping is an automated all in one billing platform that streamlines your client billing to help you save time and money. Or they'll say something like, Pave is a single pane of glass for all of your HR transactions and data to allow you to be making data informed decisions when you're planning your comp for your employees. The problem with pitches like these, with value propositions like these, when you use buzzwords like automated or streamlines or all in one or single pane of glass, those words might mean something to you, but they don't mean anything to your prospect. They're a little too generic. They're not the words your prospect uses when they describe their problems or their solutions. But the bigger problem with those buzzwords is they are the same things that every other cold caller is saying in their pitch. And we did all of this work with our context first opener to differentiate from the telemarketer. Now we're putting ourselves right back in that bucket by using those buzzwords. The biggest problem, however, is that the value of our solution, what we do, has zero contextual relevance to our prospect without a problem to attach it to. When I tell them that we have an automated billing solution, in my mind, I know what that means. But to my prospect, they now need to do the heavy thinking of thinking, okay. What use would I have for an automated billing solution? And there's a lot of data out there that shows people are far more motivated to resolve pain than they are achieve gain. And so to get them to care about what we do and our value, I'm actually gonna lead with the pain, with the problem that I believe they're experiencing to get them to care about the value of what we do, and that's called a problem proposition. So we're gonna flip the value proposition on its head. And the key is if you spend 80% of your time talking about the problem, that is what's going to demonstrate you as an industry expert that's not a rando that actually understands their space. If you think about anytime you've actually listened to one of your friends' advice, it's usually because the way that they started is they started by showing that they understood the problem you were in, not by just throwing a solution at you. From there, if you describe the problem in such specificity that is literally triggering, you only need to explain how you solve that problem in one sentence. And it usually sounds like we do this thing that allows us to solve that problem that we talked about. And then from there, we're just gonna ask them if they're open to learning more. So we're gonna do another role play here. This time, we're gonna use the example that I used over at Pave, and I might even go a little bit off script here just so you can get a sense that it doesn't always sound the same every single time. Alrighty? So, Nick, ring ring. Hello? Hey, Nick. We work with a few other, Sequoia portfolio companies. It's Arman from Pave. Have you heard your name tossed around? I don't think so. Oh, but I guess I'm not as popular as I thought. Well, I work with a few other Sequoia portfolio companies, and, honestly, like, usually, when I'm talking to a head of people ops like you around merit season, you you can't breathe under the mountain of spreadsheets because, literally, you got all the tabs and the columns that go all the way to q z, and it's a complete mess. And so, like, I work with a a lot of other folks in the portfolio, and they use Pave to consolidate their equity data, their HRIS data, and their comp data all into one place. So you literally never have to run merit cycles on spreadsheets again. My guess is you're totally good here, Nick. But are you open to taking a look at this thing just so you know it's out there? So, folks, notice, I spent 90% of my time in problem world. That was the vast majority of the problem of the talk time, and the key here is most people screw up the triggering problem. They think they're being specific, but they're actually just saying things like people hate merit cycles or working in spreadsheets takes too long. I always tell my reps, you want hairy lollipop specificity. K? So I want you to imagine you're all licking a dum dum lollipop, and you're walking around. You're licking the dum dum lollipop, and you accidentally drop your lollipop. And that lollipop falls flush inside of a shag rug, and you can see, like, the bristles wrapping around the dum dum lollipop and all that stuff. And then you give it a nice little you know, you're you're making some churros in there. You give it a nice little twirl, and then you hold up that lollipop to the light. Put it in the chat. What do you see? Someone's gonna get it. You've got a sick, sick mind, man. It's gross. Fur. Hair off of your dog. You see hair from the lollipop. It is so obviously specific that you can see the scenery of the problem. That's the degree of specificity that you want. Alrighty? So we're not selling at Lollipop cleaner. Unfortunately, we're selling software in this case. So, Nick, walk us through a more practical example. We're selling selling something even more exciting, billing software. Right. We need to make the problem so, so specific that our prospect can see that same hairy lollipop. Because when they see the problem, when we bring them back to that really frustrating time, that gets them to sit up, and it earns us the right to tell them more about our solution. And so we're leading with a very triggering problem. So let's actually talk about how you can build said problem. What I have here is a base problem statement from when I used to sell billing software to law firms. And the base problem statement might be, most CFOs tell us that billing takes a lot of time. Well, that's not really a specific enough problem to get them to say, ugh. That's really frustrating. What I need to do is I need to layer in a number of different descriptors to make the problem more specific. And so some examples here are, I can add in the persona of either the person I'm calling or the type of company that I'm calling. So in this case, it's not just most CFOs, it's most CFOs of insurance defense law firms. Additionally, if I wanna build on it further, I can add in the annoyances about why billing takes a lot of time. In this case, it was the deductions, rejections, and appeals. Now we're getting a better problem here. If I wanna layer in more, I can add the scenery, the time, the place, the conditions that the prospect would be experiencing when that problem came up. In this event, it was the deductions, rejections, and appeals from the insurance carriers right after they won a big case. And then if I really wanna hammer this thing home, I add the emotion. It's not they tell us that billing takes a lot of time. It's that they think it's ridiculous that billing takes a lot of time. And you can see the difference between that last statement and the first one is pretty dramatic. You do not need to add in every single descriptor here. But if you add in just a couple, it will make your problem so much more compelling and earn you the right to then tell them about how you solve said problem. And so at this point in the session, folks, you've got a couple different context first openers that you can use to get to your pitch, and you now understand the attributes of a compelling problem proposition versus a value proposition. But unless you sell literally what Arman sold at Pave or billing software to law firms, these talk tracks won't work because you now need to make them your own. And one of the things that we did in the book to make it the most usable cold calling book ever was we included homework and toolkits at the end of every single chapter to make these scripts your own. And so if you wanna scan that QR code, I don't Armand, you might need to zoom in on it a little bit. We gave you a, worksheet here to build your own heard the name tossed around opener, your own tailored permission opener, and to build your own problem proposition. So we'll give you all a second. If you wanna scan that code, you'll get that worksheet for free so you can build your own opener as well as a pitch. And three, two, one. Faster with the phones. Alrighty, folks. So at this point, now what's happened is you've opened the call. You've explained what you do. And nine times out of 10, you're gonna get an objection. It's almost surprising if you don't get an objection. You almost need to, like, look them up on LinkedIn and make sure that they're actually still working for the company. And so we're gonna talk through first the mister Miyagi method to handle any objection. That starts with why most objections aren't really objections, which will imply how you think about them, which will imply the three steps that we'll take to handle any objection in the world, and then lastly, when and how you book the meeting. Great. So let's start with why most objections are not really real objections. Again, we have to put ourselves in our prospects' shoes for a second and use our magic empathy muscle. But if you actually think about your prospects' experience, when you cold call them, this is an unexpected, frankly, kind of unwelcome interruption right in the middle of their workday. And when they hear a stranger's voice on the phone asking them if they've heard the name tossed around, for a second, it turns their brain it puts their brain into that fight or flight state where their logical part of their brain shuts off, and they're just trying to find a way to get off the phone with you as quickly as possible. And so what you'll see is most objections that your prospects say to you on a cold call, they're not logical, well thought out, well reasoned objections. They're actually reactions to the cold call. Another way to think about it is most of the objections that you get are not to what you sell. It's objections to the interruption of your cold call. And so in order to overcome those, we need to find a way to get them out of that fight or flight state and to turn their brain back on and get them listening to us again. And so that's why the first step of the mister Miyagi method is to literally agree with the objection. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but if you just try to handle or fight the objection, they are not gonna listen to you. And a lot of reps, if someone says I'm not interested, they're gonna start pitching or they're gonna start explaining all the reasons you should be interested. But instead, if someone says I'm not interested, I'm gonna say, shoot. Nick, this one's totally my bad. My my guess is you probably would have called us if you were. Or if Nick says, I've got no budget, I'm gonna agree with it. I'm gonna say, honestly, Nick, I hear you, man. Like, nowadays, it it's hard enough to keep your budget, let alone get something new. When I say something like that, it's literally like I pulled the chair out from underneath the prospect as they were trying to sit in it. They're gonna think, this guy's not gonna try to pitch me. And at that point, the brain is turned on again. You've lowered the pressure of the sale. And now what you're gonna do is you're gonna get them to pile on even more. You gotta get them talking. It's shown in the Gong data that the longer the call goes, the more likely they are to book a meeting with you, and that means you have to have enough back and forth to demonstrate that you're not a complete rando, and you can actually hold a conversation. And so I'm gonna incentivize them to stay on the line and have a little bit more conversation. That sounds like this. From there, I'm gonna say, Nick, just so no one calls you again, is it that there's no budget for this cycle, or is it that literally, like, any spend whatsoever requires you to do, like, a triple backflip? So notice there are two things at play in this talk track. I'm gonna underline them. Number one, the incentive to stay on the phone. Just so no one calls you again, could you really pile on to this objection? And then number two, the other thing is I'm splitting the objection. So I'm saying, is it no budget this cycle, or is it any spend whatsoever is pretty much impossible? And the reason that this is important is this not only demonstrates my industry expertise, it also demonstrates that I'm listening, and I actually heard their objection out. And it makes it really, really, really easy for them to reply effectively. But, honestly, even if they don't give me the right answer or one of the two answers, that's okay. The fact that I asked a question and I got them talking a little bit more, it that alone is enough to lower their guard just a little bit. And this is the last place where most sellers will screw it up is the prospect will give them an answer like, look. It's it's a bit of both. To be frank, like, we're we're really just tight on cash, and then they'll go right back to pitching. Your goal is not to sell the car right now. It's not to sell the product. It's to sell the test drive. You need to answer the question. Why should they meet with you even if they don't end up buying your product? So it sounds like this. I'm gonna say, honestly, Nick, I get it, man. You're probably not gonna buy this thing right now. But I I know this might sound like a crazy idea. Every once in a while, if budget does free up down the road, usually, the the people who get it at least have, like, a directional sense of what they'd want. So would you be open to taking a look at this thing later on in the week? Not for now, but just so you know what's out there for down the road. And so what I've done here is now the reason that Nick is gonna take the meeting is not because he wants to buy the Tesla right now. The reason he's taking the meeting is because I'm giving him a way to secure budget in the future. He's gonna look like a total goon if budget frees up, and he's like, I don't know what I want, but can I go find some something to buy? He at least wants to know what's on the punch list. And then when he's in the car, when he's in the meeting, that's when I can sell him on how we're gonna get rid of his current car or how we're gonna finance it or how we're gonna do a rip and replace, but you can't do that on a cold call. You just met him. So those were the three steps. Agree, get them talking, incentivize conversation, and then you're gonna sell the test drive. Alright? Amazing. So, Arman, let's actually make this a little more real for people now that folks have the Miyagi framework. Folks, let us know in the chat what objections you are running into the most, and we'll actually show you some examples of how you can Miyagi them. While folks are typing that, one thing to know about objections is there's a couple different types of objections, dismissive objections, situational objections, and existing solution objections. And while you're gonna Miyagi all of them, the approach, depending upon the type, varies slightly. And so you all saw we don't have any budget. Let's, let's see. Armand, I don't know if you've been watching the chat. Let's hit the competitor one. There there are a lot of competitors. And then let's do that one first. And then gatekeepers is coming up, not interested is coming up a lot. And so let's do that. While you're putting that up, folks in the book, we literally pulled data with Gong on the 18 most common objections, and we gave scripts on how to handle every single one of them. We won't be able to get into all 18, but let's do the, the competitor one here, Armand. Alright. So we do this in house. It's a long standing policy. It's a brutal one. So folks with competitors, the key with any competitor or any in house solution even is for each of your major competitors or competitor buckets, you need to memorize one trap question. K? One trap question. And a trap question is just a question that pokes a hole in something that their current solution can't do that your solution can do. So when I was selling compensation software at Pave, there were other providers out there that were really, really good at, like, salary planning, so your w two income. But if you ever wanted to give stock option bonuses, it was, like, a complete mess, and you had to do that separately on spreadsheets. And so watch how I'm gonna turn that into a trap question and pry that open into a bigger problem. So 321. Ring, ring. Yeah. Sorry, man. We're we're using CompX. Oh, CompX. Like, honestly, Nick, they're they're a great group, and it it rarely makes sense to switch off of them if you actually like them. So, look. Just just so no one else from my team reaches out to you, that that must mean you're not you're not doing stock option bonuses or anything like that. Right? Well, we are, but why? Oh, well, I I mean, other HR teams, they they usually find that when managers can't see the cash and the equity in the same place, they'll oftentimes actually request a bigger cash bonus to make up for the fact that they can't see that the person's total cash plus equity is actually quite large. And so that that's actually something that we support as we do all the cash equity planning and everything in one place. My guess is you're still not gonna switch. But if nothing else, would you be open to taking a look at this thing just so you know it's out there? So notice the trap that I the trap question I asked was, oh, like, you're you're not doing stock option bonuses. Right? I'm assuming that they're gonna they're they're not gonna fall in the Right? But I know because I'm calling tech companies. I know Nick is doing stock option bonuses. If he's on CompX, I know the trap question that's gonna poke a hole, and then I'm going to poke the or I'm gonna pry open the impact of that hole and say, oh, that actually turns into a bigger problem from you. Again, I'm never pooh pooh ing on Nick's solution. I'm always saying, it's probably not gonna make sense for you to switch. Like, you're probably not gonna make the move right now, but why don't you take a look? And that's when I can actually get them to do the rip and replace later on. Awesome. So I think, a couple of other people are saying not interested, Armand, which that's definitely a dismissive objection almost always. When you get not interested, it's not that they're not interested in what you sell. It's that they're not interested in the cold call, and they're just trying to get you off the phone. And so when you get a particularly this phone can often be very abrasive where people will be like, I'm not interested. Right? They they almost yell it at you. You've gotta respond in equally ridiculous fashion if you're like, oh, well, I guess you woulda called me. You've gotta make them realize how ridiculous this is also to equal things out. So do do you wanna you wanna roleplay this one? Let's do it. And just to give you guys a sense, like, 50% of objections are dismissive objections. It's like these ones. Literally, half of them are dismissive objections. They're just spots. And you'll notice that the the framework to handle I'm not interested is very emblematic of other objections. We're gonna agree with the objection, be really disarmingly blunt, and then we're gonna get to the real objection because dismissive objections are not real objections. Alright. Three, two, one. Ring ring. I'm not interested. Shoot. My bad, Nick. Look. Either my pitch was really crummy or you you would've reached out to us if you were. Just so no one calls you again, could you be brutally honest with me? Is it is it that you've got a solution, you you're not thinking about this problem at all, or is it that you just hate getting hold calls? And it's it's okay if it's number three. We're already using SalesGoons' compacts solution. Alright? There you go. SalesGoons' compacts solution. Fantastic. Alright. So what I did there is notice I agreed with the objection, disarmingly blunt in Nick's rather bizarre role play voice there. And then number two, you gotta quickly get them to stay on the line by inserting that just so no one calls. Again, like, get that one in there. Otherwise, like, not interested. They're like, the phone's already drifting away from their face. K? From there, you gotta split the objection here. And my split is in house solution Mhmm. Competitor, or, like, my pitch sucked. Mhmm. By doing that, I'm probably going to get the competitor or the in house solution, or Nick might just be like, wait. What what do you do? Because he wasn't listening the first time. Mhmm. Now I have the real objection, and then you're gonna it again. I see some people in the chat saying next call, next lead. Exactly. Like, you've gotta keep them on the phone for it's like a game of inches. You get the next objection, but realistically with not interested, like, you've got a second to keep them on the line. Yeah. Alright. Let's, let's keep moving forward. So we're we've got a million other objections in the book. Again, we'll send out links to, like, get all this stuff live, but, hopefully, that gives you a sense of the high level methodology for handling any objection. Gatekeepers, voice mails, they prevent you from even getting to the conversation in the first place. So how do you think about them? How do you handle gatekeepers with the triple bypass, which is not a surgery? And then how do you leave double tap voice mails? Gatekeepers. Awesome. So let's talk about getting past gatekeepers. Think about the gatekeepers job. Gatekeepers have two responsibilities. They have two jobs. Job number one is to shut the door on people who don't belong. People like us, salespeople. This is the job that most of us see with gatekeepers getting the door shut on us. But they also have another job, which is to open the door for people who do belong. And so if you think about that, what the gatekeeper's doing is they're just looking to detect and reject pitches. And so if they sense that this might be a salesperson calling to be connected, they're gonna shut the door on you, which is why trying to befriend the gatekeeper or share a little bit about your pitch doesn't work. Your gatekeeper is not going to put their job at risk connecting some random salesperson that decided to be nice that day to their boss. And so instead, the way that we're gonna get past the gatekeeper is ethically, we're never gonna lie, we're going to make it seem like we're someone who should have the door open for us. And we're gonna do that both in the tone of what we say as well as the specific information that we choose to share and that we choose to not share. And so we use what's called the gatekeeper triple bypass approach. And with the triple bypass, you have three tries to get past the gatekeeper, and they build on each other. So if your first try doesn't work, you still have a shot at the second and a shot at the third. And so it sounds something like this. The first step in the triple bypass method is called the slide by, where you are simply going to be asked to be connected to your prospect, nothing else. And so it might sound something like this. Gatekeeper answers the phone and they go, hello. Aubrey Graham's office. I'm gonna say, hey. Could you get me over to Aubrey? It's Nick. No company name. No small talk here. Nothing about my product. I'm also using first names. I'm making it seem like I'm walking straight to the elevator, and they shouldn't get in my way. Now this will get us past some percentage of gatekeepers, but the savvier ones are gonna push us for a little bit more. They're gonna ask us something like, well well, what's this regarding? And right here is where most gatekeeper passes fail because this is where most salespeople bluntly share their company name or they talk about their product or they try to make friends with the gatekeeper. Instead, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give them context for why I'm calling, and I'm gonna keep the focus of the conversation on getting me to my destination. So if I use your Northwestern example, Arman, I'll say something like, yeah. I actually work with a couple other SCAD partners in the LA office. Would would you give him a heads up? It's Nick Sigelski. I'm sharing, hey. I work with their peers, and I'm asking a question at the end to keep the focus on getting me to my destination. The person asking the questions is the one who controls the conversation, and we want that to be us. And that will get us past another series of gatekeepers, but the toughest ones will push us for even more. And they might say something like, I need to see if he's in. What company are you with, sir? At this point, again, I don't wanna get into the pitch. I don't want them to feel like there's a pitch behind a salesperson coming or a salesperson behind a pitch, one of those two. And I wanna share some social proof. So in this case, I might say something like, yeah. We actually we help a couple other partners in the office with their tax planning. It's Northwestern Mutual. I actually sent him a note the other day. Would would you mind letting him know it's Nick? This assumes I've emailed them in the past, which I think you all are doing. But what I'm doing is I'm never leaning on company or product. I'm using context and social proof as a way to get past. Now the Gong data unfortunately showed that when you encounter a gatekeeper, it reduces your success rate on a cold call by almost forty percent. And so if you still get shut down here, you might throw in the towel and ask to leave a voice mail, and that's perfectly fine. But this will get you past a significant number of gatekeepers. Alrighty. And that brings us to the last thing that can prevent you from getting to the call at all, which are voice mails. So should you leave voice mails at all? There are a few questions that will trigger as many sales floor debates as this one. The common arguments against voice mails are number one, people never call back. Number two, they take a lot of time. And then number three, they drop your connect rate by 28%. And that's that's probably the most dangerous one right there is if I call Nick, he sees my phone number, and I call him again. He was already gonna block me because he saw my phone number, but he's far less likely to pick up a call from me again if he knows that I already called him before. K? That said, we still recommend leaving voice mails. And the reason for that is voice mails literally double your email reply rate. K? So it's huge. In every other email, in your sequence or your flow or whatever you're using. But the key is these concerns have some merit to them. K? And so this is actually going to alter our strategy. So because people never call back, when we leave voice mails, we are not gonna ask for a callback. We're gonna direct them to reply over email. That's number one. Number two, because they take a lot of time, we're only gonna lead it to voice mails. That's why they're called double tap voice mails. And Gong data actually shows that reply rates will spike between one and two voice mails. Anything after that is sort of overkill, and you're just wasting your time. And then the third piece is as you leave voice mails, you should be rotating your phone numbers. So you should be, like, rotating numbers. Most sales engagement platforms allow you to do this because you wanna keep that connect rate high on your future dials. Alright? So let's walk through the two different voice mail talk tracks. Again, great screenshot moment. Time to scan the QR codes. First voice mail, Watch this one. Fifteen seconds, context only. It's gonna lead with context just like the heard the name tossed around opener. So I'm gonna say, Nick, we work with a few other SCAD and partners in the LA office. No need to call me back here. I'm literally about to hit send on an email. Just so we don't play phone tag, would you mind replying and letting me know if it's even moderately interesting? It it'll come from Armon at Northwestern. Cheers. So most people pitch in the voice mail or they lead with their name and company. The moment you do those things, instantly deleted. Voice mail is instantly deleted. So what we're doing is we're actually stacking the voice mail. We're front loading the voice mail with the stuff that is most likely to actually get them to reply, which is the fact that we work with other folks in their office or the fact that one of our customers shares a similar investor or the fact that we work with other compensation partners in the Chicago area, whatever that might be. The second voice mail, similar to the gatekeeper approach. If the context only approach didn't get us a reply, we gotta give them a little bit more. So we're still not gonna pitch, but we're gonna hide the social proof in the email. So it sounds like this. Hey, Nick. We work with a few other Scadden partners in the LA office on their tax planning investments amongst other things. I'm sure you've got most of that stuff taken care of. I'm literally about to press send on an email to give you a sense of where we're what we're doing with those other folks. Just so we don't play phone tag, would you mind replying and letting me know if it's even moderately interesting over there? It'll come from Arman at Northwestern. Cheers. So all I'm doing is I'm I'm really emphasizing the fact that I work with these other folks. And I'm gonna give you a sense over email, like, how I work with them. And, again, reply there, and you can totally tell me to kick rocks if you don't like it. You got your two voice mails. At this point, move on. Keep calling them, but don't keep leaving voice mails. And so, folks, congratulations. This has covered everything that you're going to say on the phones. But like we said earlier, it's all about what you're doing off the phones to make sure that you're even getting to these conversations. So let's start with dial conversion, and this is probably the most underrated chapter in the book. I have hired over a 100 SDRs in my career, and I have never found that the number one performer has the highest activity on the board. And the reason for that is it takes time to prune your bad numbers to make sure that you have a high connect rate. It takes time to prioritize your prospects and take the bad ones out of your pipeline so that you have a high set rate. It takes time to convert your meetings. And if you use all of that time towards making more cold calls, you would have more cold calls, but your conversion would be absolutely horrendous. And so the best sellers dial smart, and they break the sales math equation. The single most commonly screwed up places with connect rates, that's what we're gonna cover in this session. Awesome. So you might remember from the data in the beginning that the seventy fifth percentile rep, the pretty good rep rep had more than double the connect rate of the average rep. And in the book, we've got it's something like twenty, twenty five different tips and best practices that you can use to increase your connect rates. I don't have time to go through all of those in the twelve minutes left, so let's go deep on one of them. Let's actually talk about marking your tracks. Marking your tracks is as follows. The first time that you call a new list of prospects, the first time you call through a new list of numbers should be your lowest connect rate and your least efficient calls through those numbers. And the reason for it is you're gonna call numbers that end up being fax lines and you hear that screeching noise, or you'll call somebody and somebody answers, but it's not your prospect. It's the wrong number. And what you wanna do is you wanna leave yourself notes. You wanna mark your tracks about the numbers at your disposal. So as you call through numbers, you should mark them based upon their quality. Red numbers are bad numbers. These are the repeated busy lines, the fax lines, the wrong numbers. Once you've marked a number as red, you should never waste another dial on it again. Your yellow numbers are the ones where something smells fishy. It rings once and then goes right to voice mail, or it's a busy signal. If this happens once, mark it as yellow. If it happens again, move it to red, and don't waste your time on it. Your green numbers are the ones where you are a 100% sure that it's the right person. This rings multiple times, and their voice mail greeting confirms it's them. And what you'll do is over time, you start to build up a dial inventory or a dial base with all of your historical knowledge about the right numbers to call for your prospects. Additionally, what you'll do is you'll mark your tracks for other things. So if you encounter phone trees, you'll mark the dial path that you need to hit to get to your prospect. So the first time you listen to a phone tree, you should be jotting down, okay, I need to hit +1 3476 to get right to Armand. And so the next time I call, I can punch that in right away and not have to listen to that. Another example, there's a gatekeeper. I'll mark that they're on the other end of the line, so I'm prepared to run the triple by pass. So there's way more, but that is one way that you can boost connect rates. Alrighty. And, folks, there are a million other ways to break the sales math equation, but you can see that the differences between the average rep and the top quartile rep are massive. So those tactics will get you from a five to a 13% connect rate. It's huge. If you wanna boost your set rate, the major thing that we go through is how to build a list and prioritize people who are raising their hands and are most likely to buy right now. And then for your show rates, you can get those from 56% to 72% just by sending two really solid confirmation emails, one a week prior and one the day prior. And if you booked it inside of the week, just send the confirmation email the day before and make sure you include some research or some context in it to show that you prepared for the call. Alright? We'll send more on that afterwards. You'll find more on that in the book. But, folks, the beauty of this is now that you have efficient and smart dials, it's time to make sure that you dial as much as possible because you have all the talk tracks you need, and you're not dialing like a buffoon and just calling all these bad numbers. And so we're gonna talk about the perfect time to cold call, how to make sure this stuff actually gets in your calendar, and then how to double your dials. Alright? Nick? This one's an easy one. The best time of day to make your cold calls is first thing in the morning. We looked at the data with Gong, and you can see the morning has the highest connect rate. But the real reason you should dial in the morning is when you prioritize making your cold calls before you're allowed to do anything else, it guarantees that you get them done that day. Slight variances in pickup rate, which you can see across the day, there's not that much variability. The number one thing is consistency. And so you make sure you get it done every day by doing it first thing before everything else, and that will make up for any variances in connect rate in your specific industry. So do it first thing, get it off your plate, and then move on to other more enjoyable pieces of selling. That said, this is much easier said than done because there are other jobs you have to do in sales. So you're gonna divide your day into thirds, your green hours where you're gonna try to hit your prospecting goal. Your yellow hours is when you're gonna take most of your customer calls from twelve to three, and then your red hours are from three to six, and that's when you're gonna be doing most of your admin work. So the way that you actually do this in practice is step one, you gotta tame your inbox. I know this is gonna give some of y'all a heart palpitation, but if you are replying to your prospects three times per day at 08:30, twelve, and three, it is okay. They can wait a second. If you just constantly get dragged around by your inbox all the time, you will find that your pipeline is going down and down and down and down because you're chasing your deals. Your deals are you're not working your deals. Your deals are working you. K? So once you control the inbox, then you start to plot your prospecting blocks. And so I like to have three of them. Two in the morning, one in the afternoon, especially great for our East Coast folks who wanna make sure that they hit Pacific in the morning. K? First thing that goes, cold calls at 9AM, then I do a cold email block at eleven, and then you can do flex prospecting from one to two. You've gotta hit your prospecting daily goal in these first two ones. This third block is the block that gets you to president's club. This is when you get ahead on prospecting. From there, you take customer calls in the blocks in between. Try to prioritize those ones in the afternoons, but the reality is every once in a while, someone's only gonna be able to meet at nine, and that's okay. The rule is if you have to book a meeting at nine over your cold call block, you cannot move the cold call block out of nine to twelve, and so make sure that that stays in those green hours. Alrighty? And then the final piece is a lot of people think that cold calling or sending emails are the same thing as building a list of prospects. That is not true. That is admin or prospecting preparation. And so at the end of the day, find the accounts, find the contacts, sequence the contacts, and make sure that you step into the next day with 60 dials locked and loaded. And, folks, congratulations. You know what that means? You have the opener, the problem prop, the objections, the voicemails, the gatekeepers. You know how to maximize your dial conversion. You know how to plan your day. And the only thing that will literally stop you from being successful at this point, you don't even have to buy the book at this point. The only thing that will stop you is if you don't make the calls. And so the final conclusion covers how to kill call reluctance forever, which I believe call reluctance is fundamentally a confidence issue. And I define confidence as the extent to which you believe your inputs will lead to the outputs. And so in other words, do you actually believe that you will book a meeting if you make enough cold calls? Mhmm. And so you can try to manufacture this confidence by reading more books, writing out your scripts, researching the prospects, or you could even try to do that by reading our book 17 times, or you could realize that the only way to really prove this to yourself is to make it a reality. You have to make so many cold calls that you become numb to the rejection, and your mind makes the connection that 50 dials equals one meeting over time. And the hundredth time you hear prospect implode, you will laugh despite the fact that the first time that you heard the prospect implode, you will freak out. And so the reason that you're okay with this is because you know the meeting is coming because you've proved it to yourself in the past. So am I suggesting you go into the game underprepared? No. You only need two things to get started, your minimum viable top tracks, and we gave you those today, and then go practice them around the block 50 times. And you don't even have to read this book. And so on that note, I was gonna tell Nick we should just tell people not to read the book. But, apparently, there are still some reasons to read this thing. There are plenty of reasons to still get the book. Arman, you and I have always given away the sales tactics for free. But the reason that this book, you you should still buy it, is there are so many more frameworks in the book and talk tracks that we didn't cover with, like, tone voiceovers that you can scan and stories in there. This session just skimmed the very top of what's in the book. There is so much more value in the structure and format of what we wrote. And so, folks, if you don't believe us, you might believe these people no one's ever heard of, like Jeb Blunt, the author of Fanatical Prospecting, Matt Dixon, the author of Challenger Sale, Keenan, Gap Selling, John Barros, Jason Bay, Mark Casaglow started the outreach sales team, Ian Konjac, number one all time rep at sales Salesforce, Amit Bendoff, CEO of Gong, KD, the legendary four time CRO VP of sales, and Ken Amar, who's outreach's number one all time SDR. Plus everyone who has already written down that this is the best cold calling book that they have ever read in their lives. Folks, for all of this, the talk tracks, the frameworks, the stories, everything you got today, most people would charge $15.99 for a cold calling mastermind, $3.99 for a commission crash course, $20 for a 400 sales page sales book. But folks today, in sales, you know you'd establish value first and then you price high at the end of the sales cycle. So the price at the end of the sales cycle is $1. $1 for the Kindle edition. Why? The reason for that is because in the introduction, there is a line that says do not use this book as an excuse. We literally give you the cold call script in the first pages so you can start cold calling, and we wanted to make sure that the price of this book was not an excuse. And we know if you like what you see, you'll have the success on the phones, and people will ask you how you did it. And we hope that you share this book with other people around you. So on that note, we're at time. Scan the QR code. Go get your book. Folks, if you have an iPhone or an iPad, you can get to the Kindle app, and you can read it on that also. So if you're Also, like, Apple Books, Nook, if anyone's a Nook reader or whatever it is. Yeah. So the digital copy is a buck. If you want the paperback one, unfortunately, like, we have printing costs and stuff. So digital copy is a buck. If you love it, pick up a paperback. But, thank you everybody for joining us. We worked really, really hard on this. Arman and I spent almost a year. Every single day, we spent three or four hours a day writing, and we beat the heck out of each other writing this thing. We really, really pushed each other to make this the most actionable, practical, usable book so that you don't have to spend countless hours reading 12 other books on cold calling. We wrote this because selling is really, really tough right now. Building pipeline is really, really tough right now, and we wanna make it easy on all of you. So please pick it up. Thank you, folks. It is unbelievable that this is a job for Nick and I, and it is, we are both extremely grateful to have y'all as supporters. Peace.
