## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. I'm your host for today, Nick Sigelski, joined with my cohost, Jen Allen Knuth. And today, we've got Grace Presnick, who is a senior enterprise account executive at Outreach, and she is one of the most disciplined salespeople that I've ever met. Jen, why should people listen? Grace is definitely the queen of discipline. I think as many of us look at a very busy end of the year, it is so easy to get caught up in the urgent and not the important. So I think the coolest thing about this episode is hearing how Grace breaks down her day so she doesn't fall into those bad traps of just responding to the reactive stuff. A three, a two, a one urgently listened to this episode. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes.

Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Grace. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alrighty. The first one is making sure to use calendar blocks to avoid becoming any type of a reactive puppet. Oh, very nice. What's number two? Number two is on the same page, but one of those calendar blocks must be a time right after your weekly pipeline call with your manager to go and execute on the items that you just talked about with your manager. Oh, I'm gonna have to ask more about that later. Round us out. What's number three? And the last one is in terms of engaging with your clients or your prospects, making sure you have some type of auto reminder on any email that has an ask so that you're making sure nothing slips through the cracks. Grace, I'm really excited for this one because you were telling me about what a discipline and operationally minded seller you are. Actually, that was me saying you seem that way, and you were like, yeah, I am. And I believe that discipline is one of the things that makes her breaks a really good salesperson. You were telling me a bit in preshow about how you will have a pipeline review call with your manager, and you'll be going over all of your different opportunities and you both will be brainstorming ways that you can advance that opportunity. But then you told me you actually set a separate calendar block for after that meeting for a very intentional reason. And I'm wondering if you can talk about that a bit. So just to give you perspective, my weekly pipeline call since I started in sales with my manager, no matter what manager I've had is it's always an hour and it's for every single week. So we go through as many deals as we can, obviously in quarter pipeline. And then if we have time, even looking further into pipelines. So there's so many different ways over the years, I've worked on collecting that to do list after a pipeline call. Right now I use Outreach, but I create tasks on my opportunities. And then that calendar block for right after my pipeline call is I actually go and execute on those tasks to go and get more multi threaded, introduced an executive, start my success plan for that opportunity. Whatever my manager and I just talked about, because at the end of the day, that is the most important call that you have in the week. And if you can stay disciplined to go and execute on all of those tasks, you're going to be faster with it anyways, if you're doing it right when it's fresh in your mind. So I see it more as like time saving for later in the week, but it's worked out for me really well. I want to dig in more into the stuff that you're doing in this hour long sprint after the pipeline review, but I'm actually curious about what you're doing before the pipeline review, because something tells me that you're not showing up disorganized. Yeah. Definitely am not. I have two different calendar blocks on my calendar to prep for this call. So, the first one is Monday mornings. I'm looking at all of the next steps that I had in my opportunities and make sure that I've either taken action on them, have like, what is my goal for the week for this opportunity to progress it or close it? And then I also have a pipeline prep calendar block where I'm going through and updating. I've added on, I think most people in sales use the next step field in their CRM for their opportunities. At least that's what I've seen in my career. In that next step field, I actually have two areas. I have next steps and then another part that's updates. Because I think that's always been a gray area, and this is my time to brainstorm and strategize before bringing it to my manager. So the next steps part is if I literally have a meeting on the calendar, in a dinner book and they're coming to an event, those types of on the calendar next steps are dated with a description. And then I have update and that update is going to say, heard from them that they're talking about budgets this week and I will be following up. So that's like my update narrative. But the next step part is where I actually have something actionable. So it helps us have a really productive conversation. I do brainstorming beforehand so that we're coming in together for my manager just to build off of what I've already brought to the table. I think one of the underrated things that you just talked about was before this meeting, you are having a brainstorm session with yourself about the things you can do to advance your opportunities. And what this does is if you just show up and you're processing in real time with your manager on the line about the things you could do to move the deal forward, you can look like a chump. But if you're like, hey. Here's the deal that I have. Here's the three things that I'm gonna do in the next couple days to move this deal forward. They're like, dang, Grace. This is really good. I'm curious. You talked about being really direct and to the point. Are there certain things that you're saying, Hey, this isn't within the scope of a Piper view? Like, I'm not gonna talk about this or we're not gonna focus on this. And if so, what those things are? Yes, definitely. The larger deals, there is a million things that we can talk about and brainstorm and do. And when I have this feeling of, all right, I could use the rest of this hour to talk about this opportunity. Let's find additional time for me to actually bring my account plan up. Let's bring in my SDR and the CSM and like really talk about this opportunity and not be thinking about the next 10 ops we need to talk about, and squeeze in. Yeah. And I think one of the other things that you're sort of sparking is in bad pipeline calls. It's very easy to just focus on immediately what's in front of us. Obviously, everybody wants to close deals. Our managers want us to close deals. How do you think about striking the right balance between the stuff front of our face, like the q four deals or whatever is in play for December versus thinking about, as you talked about, some of those bigger deals which do require the work? Like, how do you balance that time in your pipeline calls? Yeah. It definitely depends on the time of the quarter and time of the fiscal year And just the time of if a lot of ops are in that kind of crunch time zone or if things have just closed and we have a second to breathe. So I think the way that we personally balance it the best is when I need specific time and energy focus on an op that I don't wanna be distracted on a million other ops to think about. That's when I, I literally have like a big bets call or a deal strategy sync. And I ask at least my manager and maybe my director or VP to join. But it's hard because we look at pipeline from, the highest value dollar amount down. And so of course the ones that have the first amount of your attention are going to be the highest deal. And so it's always this tricky balance of like forecasting accurately and like maybe being a little conservative with the number, but also saying like, no, this is a really important auth and like making sure that maybe you don't wanna say it's gonna be a half $1,000,000 deal because that's gonna be like, having everybody's attention, but also you're like, but this could be so like, I wanna make sure we're putting the right attention to it. So that's where I have my own list of, these deals have the potential or these accounts have the potential to be big quota movers. How can we find time either in our pipeline call or outside the pipeline call to really focus on that? And that's where I'll pull in my leader, my internal resources to really help me give those opportunities the time that it needs, if it doesn't allow in the pipeline call. In a typical 60 pipeline call, how many opportunities will you review? Really depends. So I'm in our mid enterprise space. I would say an average, we're looking at 20 deals. 20 deals. So you've got about three minutes per deal, probably less because there's some like friction in the beginning and end of the call, etcetera, and probably some take a little longer. What gets covered in three minutes? It's gonna be those next steps. The ones that are on the books might update all in that kind of next step field. We have health scores. So that's actually AI generated through outreach, but we'll look at it and say, Hey, the health score is actually really low. Like, are you not talking to someone with a VP level? And that health score sometimes guides us at peeling back and saying, hey, maybe there is actually something that we're not seeing. So we'll look at the health score and then we'll look at amount, close date, and forecast stage. Okay. So one of the things I think is probably important context, Grace, your role is a bit more complex than just an average AE. So if I think back to when I had somewhat of a similar role to what you have today, which is you are managing renewals, you're managing upsell, cross sell, you are managing that new logo, that role is so complicated, and I've always found myself struggling to just respond to the things that were urgent. Can you talk a little bit about how you stay out of that trap and how you make sure you stay up basically on top of all of those elements of your job? I think when you said it gets really complicated, I was like, yes, it does. Sometimes I'm on a call where I'm saving a customer from going to a competitor and then logging off of that call and going on and telling someone what outreach is. Right? It is so crazy sometime the different types of conversations on a day to day basis. So what helped me when I first got into this role, because my past and my history and experience of sales has always been new logo. When I got into this role, I was like, wow, yes, I get to have the same conversations with people all the time. Like that gives me energy. I get to really learn about their business. What I didn't really think about was that complexity piece of how many different aspects I am going to need to master of just account management to be successful in this role. So I remember taking a step back and I actually worked with a former manager on this. Like, what are the parts of your weeks that you do? Like, let's break that into boxes and start like compartmentalizing those. So we put together reactive engagement. So that's gonna be like email replies, you know, the things that are right in front of you that are so easy to get just sucked into. And then there's proactive engagement. So that's gonna be prospecting. It can be those opportunity tasks we were talking about. And honestly, like probably some of the most important stuff you're gonna do on your week to be successful in sales, when there's sales planning. So that's even taking it a step further, like going through and updating my forecast as an example, or, going through and creating my success plan or my mutual action plan, doing account planning. And then the last one is actual sales calls. Like I'm spending a lot of my week talking to clients, which is great. So I've broken it down into those four categories. And then I literally use the calendar blocks to have time for reactive engagement. In the mornings, I'm going through my inbox. All I'm sifting it through. I use the zero inbox strategy by Jeff Su. It is like super hot topic on my team right now, if you haven't looked into that. But it allows me to basically like categorize my inbox and then put it into action. So then that feels like I get a quick win. And then later in the day or in the week, I'm have like an actual two hour block to do prospecting. And that is in outreach. I'm cold calling, I'm emailing, I'm sequencing. I'm going back to my SDR roots. So there's a lot of different things to do all the time. But, when I think about those four blocks and those four kind of disciplines of my job, it actually helps me really stay focused so that I accomplish something and then I can move into another box and then focus and accomplish that. One of the things I'm hearing, it's the context switching that is so difficult. You're essentially changing your mind state as you jump from conversation to conversation. And I agree, like, having done both roles, when you go into a new logo role and you know, okay, here's the predictable motion. I'm gonna do it just a bunch of these different types of calls versus I might be with an upset customer or someone that has a new contact that I've never worked with. That is a lot. So I could see how having that structure and blocking that time allows you just to stay more deeply focused on the task at hand. One One of the things you mentioned when you shared your screen earlier with us, I saw your inbox and you talked about the zero inbox strategy. Can you just share a little bit more about what that is for people like me who'd never heard of it? So again, like, credit goes to Jeff Sue and my teammate that brought it even to my own attention, But it's basically a mechanism for you to go through your inbox and quickly apply labels and then archive your emails so that you basically get to a point where you have no new mail. And then those three labels are your action items, emails that you're awaiting a reply, and then the last one is the read through later. So it allows me like, okay, I have an hour to do reactive engagement. I'm gonna go to those follow-up ones and like where are people waiting for me to reply? So those are, like, those ones, and those are the best to just get through. It actually feels like, oh my gosh, I'm getting so much done today. And then the awaiting a reply is, you know, you're waiting for somebody to do something else that also ties into my auto reminders. I have my auto reminders coming in at 8AM every day for emails I sent two days ago. So those ones, if I don't just quickly follow-up, I'll put that in my waiting reply so that I do it at a different time. And then the read throughs are things like mostly internal that I just will get to when I get to, not the highest priority. It's phenomenal. It's like literally changed my life. So I definitely recommend to anybody who likes to be operationally efficient. It's great. I remember when I saw your screenshot, I was like, oh my gosh. I just I love the organization. I always try to be like a literal zero inbox person and keep it as a to do list. But one of the things I like about what you shared is it's a mix of different things. So when I have a thirty minute block, I'm spending at least a few minutes trying to sort through it. So I love the idea of, like, it's presorted, so you're not wasting any time. Like, that is the ultimate efficiency play. I love that. Adding on to that, there's the color coding for the different inboxes and the labels that are automatically added. And I carry that into my calendar as well. And that's something I've done forever, but I use a bright yellow for customer meetings. I have a green for internal meetings. I have a pink for personal appointments. I have a dark purple because that's outreach and that's for all of my, like, prospecting and reactive engagement and my sales planning time, where it's head down, Slack off, phone away time. So I'm very color coordinated when it comes to my time. It just helps me visually as well. When you think about your calendar, it sounds like you're using calendar blocks for work sessions of a particular nature. Is your day blocked off from start until finish, or do you have open gaps of time? I'm curious about how you manage your day and think about that stuff. Yeah. You probably wanna talk to my SDR when I over block it because he's like, Grace, I need time to schedule meetings for you. So I would love to block it to the point where take dog for walk, eat lunch. Like some weeks are genuinely like that. I try to keep blocks open for scheduling purposes, opportunities, new meetings with that my answer is booking or that I'm booking. But it is pretty much blocked from, like, email reactive time, like first thing in the morning until, like, follow-up time in the afternoon. When I'm looking at those other blocks of, like, my prospecting block, like proactive engagement on opportunities, I will, protect my calendar and keep it as open as I can until the Friday before, and then go and say, all right, I've got a three hour block here. I'm gonna take half of that and focus on this part of my job, like prospecting so that I can be a little bit flexible because we have to be flexible as like, our calendar has to be flexible, but I try to be as structured as, again. To that end, I'm curious around your intentionality around what you schedule when. And what I mean by that was, for me, when I was making a ton of cold calls, I would always schedule my cold calling block for first thing in the morning because I wanted it to be, like, a workout where it was, like, I get it off my back as early as possible. But different people do different things. How do you think about the strategy of where you place those blocks based on what you're doing? So a cold calling, I'm the same way. If I'm doing an actual, like, call blitz, call block, it's gonna be in the morning. It's gonna be between eight and nine, latest nine to ten. Get it out of the way. It also, like, look at the data. That's when people answer the highest chance of answering. So, yeah, definitely do that. Same with that inbox. Going through that first thing in the morning so that I feel like I get quick wins. I try to keep the, bulk middle of my day between, ten and three open for customer calls. And then I look at three to five for any of the submit my forecast, update my, mutual action plans. All of the odds and ends of sales planning is, like, usually more in the afternoon. So I wanna go back to something you said before. You talked about working with your SDR, and you were talking about you gotta keep some time open for them. Curious about a couple of things. One, if you have a one to one pairing or if they're shared it's a shared resource across others, but how do you also teach some of that discipline to the SDR? I think that was something that was always difficult too when you've got different levels of discipline when it comes to how you organize your time. I'm curious if you have anything share worthy there that you think would be helpful advice for other sellers. So I try to teach and share my strategies with my SDR for sure. And part of that is through, like, if I'm busy, I'm not replying to slack. Don't text me like I'm busy. And like, that might be frustrating if you want a quick answer or you want me to flip your opportunity, like right away, I've gotta protect my time as you should as well. So I teach it in that way. I also am very open, with my calendar. So my SDR can see every single detail. If I have a block that says, like I'm looking at my calendar right now, that says renewal updates and forecast updates. He could see that that is what I'm doing in that time. And I'm gonna be like, head down on Slack, that little emoji with your laptop. So if he really needs me and it's urgent, he can call me, but I'm very transparent that way as well. And then the last piece is I invite him to my pipeline calls. Grace, I wanna go back to something that you said earlier that got me so, so excited, which is where you were talking about how you've got this next steps field, but you're using it for, like, the next steps and also your updates. And then I remember thinking about how you're putting tasks on your opportunities to make sure that none of this stuff ever slips through the cracks. And I'm wondering if you have other little hacks that you're doing to make sure that you're really focused on moving your deals forward and behaving in an operationally minded way? I would say two things. To add on to the next steps and the updates in my next steps field, I will sometimes manifest slash strategize some next steps. So I said my next steps are things that are on the calendar. Right? There's a date, what it is, who will be there. And then enter, enter, and then there's the updates. That's like they're having a budget meeting, and I'm gonna get an update next Tuesday before five for my champion, that kind of thing. If I am really, like, I'm gonna get this next step, I'll add it as to be scheduled in the next steps part and almost, like, manifest it and be like, no. This is gonna be happening. I just have to still schedule it. So that's, like, one tip. And then the last tip is as I'm thinking about my strategy, we use success plans here at Outreach. A mutual action plan, I've used them before we had success plans, but it's milestones of what has to happen to get this deal done. And I'm open and honest with my buyers. Like, hey, from this point forward, this is usually what we have to do to get a contract executed. So I'm gonna be working on scheduling these next steps, bringing these next people in. What else has to happen on your end? And I share it with them. It's a collaborative space so that I'm not just working on the back end telling my manager doing this, I'm doing that. I'm also telling my buyers so that nobody's surprised. We're putting it out into the universe. Things are happening. Deals are moving forward. Deals are closing. So definitely using some sort of mutual action plan or success plan. So when you look at all of the different activities and things that go into your job, right, I am sitting here thinking about all of the things you could potentially label as urgent. But as you talked about before, not everything can be high importance. Not everything can be urgent. Maybe just for others who haven't had a role like yours or are considering a role like yours, can you help us think through when you think of truly urgent things related to renewals, you know, new logo, upsell, cross sell type things, What are some of the things that when they happen, you're like, okay. This is all hands on deck. This is priority number one just to give people a flavor for that kind of job. So customers come first. I have I'm a hybrid AE. I have customers that I need to renew and expand. I have quotas attached to both of those and then new logos, a new logo, greenfield accounts as well. But customers come first. So if there's an issue with a customer regarding our technology, regarding our contract, regarding their experience working with Outreach in any way, shape, or form, that takes highest priority. So that is number one. Number two is going to be deals. If I'm in the midst of negotiating and something else is coming at me and that's gonna be also, like, high priority, like, working on that, I would say my days, I do not like showing up to meetings unprepared. So preparation for sales meetings is also, like, a p one thing in my book that'll come over looking through my inbox. Like, I would rather show up ready and prepared for a sales meeting versus, like, joining the call unprepared, but my inbox is clean. What's prep for a sales meeting look like for you? Is it just look at your notes and look at their website, or are there more intentional things you're doing? It really depends. There is but it's always more intentional things than that. There is always a customized type of presentation deck. The success plan is up to date. I'm making sure that everybody that will be joining the call from my end. I would say 50% of my, like, later stage ops, I'm sending a read this before email just so everyone's on the same page. This is what we're gonna be talking about as new people on the buying side or joining the discussion and the evaluation. Can I ask you about that one? Because I found that to be really helpful for me recently for two reasons. One, late stage opportunities helps get some of the new people that are getting pulled in up to speed. But it also helps me crystallize, like, okay. What really do I wanna have happen in this meeting? What does that email look like? What are you actually saying in it, Grace? Yeah. No. It does it helps me, I think, more than maybe even if people don't read it, it helps me get in the mindset of what am I actually trying to get out of this call. And that's actually another piece that we add into the next steps now is for the next steps, we'll say what the next step is, the date, and our goal. So what is our goal of that meeting? But in that email, it's short and sweet. I need it to be readable from a phone, imagining that my buyers are going meeting to meeting and glance at it. But it is saying the agenda and maybe a dash with a little bit more context. If we're gonna be reviewing reporting, I'll sometimes send the reports in the email, but before so that they can have time to come up with questions before. That's more for renewals. But, yeah, it's short, sweet. It's just getting everybody on the same page. A lot of times, I'll also say who is joining. Because if there's more new people coming out on my end, here's their role. Here's their LinkedIn. Maybe you guys went to the same school, know each other from a past. I love it. Grace, this has been a phenomenal interview, but we are running out of time here. So we gotta move to the last question. And the last question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things that salespeople should be doing. Now I'm gonna ask you about a shouldn't. And so the final question is, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to because it hurts them more than it helps? Don't wait until right before your pipeline call to update your next steps. It doesn't help you. It doesn't progress your deals, and it definitely doesn't help your manager. Take some time. Be intentional. Prepare. Strategize so that you can add on to your preparation and strategy with another brain or two of your manager so that you can honestly just accelerate your deals and close more deals. Grace, thank you so much for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode with Grace Presnick is number one. Before you have a meeting with your manager to go through your pipeline, you should be thinking about all the things you could do to advance your pipeline. You don't wanna show up and be a deer in headlights. Number two, block time for after that meeting with your manager because you're going to brainstorm ways to progress your pipeline with that person, and you wanna be able to take action immediately after that meeting. Number three, structure your forecast calls. Grace talked about covering updates, health scores, next steps, the amount of the deal, and close dates. To avoid spending your entire pipeline review on one deal, schedule a big bets call separately where you might bring in a VP to help think through that deal as well. And number four, the zero inbox strategy. So to avoid wasting time sorting through your inbox, structure your inbox around action items, read through later, and awaiting replies. And this is the part of the show where Jen would say, Nick, how can people help us out? But I'm stealing that part from her, and I'll tell you how you can help us out. Grace is an incredible salesperson, and I think that you should let her know that. And so if you got even a semblance of value out of this episode, go look up Grace on LinkedIn and send her a note thanking her for spending a lot of time with thirty minutes to Presidents Club to help all of us us get better at selling. Thank you for listening, and we'll see you next week on the show.
