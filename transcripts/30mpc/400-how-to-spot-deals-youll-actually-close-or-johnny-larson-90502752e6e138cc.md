## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this live episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my coach, host, Nick Sigelski. And, folks, if you missed the first one, we are live in studio with the one and only Johnny Larson. He has put on two unbelievable episodes with thirty minutes to president's club. He was the number two global AE at all of Talkdesk in 2024. And, folks, this is one to watch live. Nick, why should people listen? Johnny has a philosophy of you pick the deals you're gonna win and you win those deals. And he is extremely regimented on his upfront qualification. And this isn't just like a soft, oh, I take him through BANT episode. Johnny's got a really, really nuanced and focused way that he goes through this. And so he takes us through that in the first half of this. And then in the second half, he talks about how he makes sure that those deals that he picks, he's gonna win. We got into RFPs. We get into DQs. We get into use case DQs. We get into how you push customers to figure out, is this really what you need, or are you just asking to ask? And so this is a really, really good one if you have a more complex sale. I learned a ton in this episode. And, folks, we are live in studio here with Johnny for this second episode. So if you haven't checked us out on YouTube, this is certainly one to stream onto your TV. And a three, two, one, let's roll. Alright, Johnny. Welcome back to the show. You may recall that we start every episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Thanks for having me back third time, gentlemen. First actionable takeaway is being in a position to disqualify versus qualifying opportunity. Mhmm. When you're a younger SDR, maybe an SDR team leader, even as a junior account executive, you wanna qualify everything. You want every single opportunity in Salesforce. You wanna close them. The more tenured you get, the more successful you become, the more you find yourself in a position where you jump on that early stage initial meeting or discovery call, and you're actually looking to qualify Mhmm. Right out of the gate versus qualify. And I think successful reps who see longevity make the money they wanna make. Our particular use case is if somebody comes inbound Mhmm. We are a contact center as a service. We primarily support high volume inbound b to c. Mhmm. A leader of a market development team or a sales development leader comes inbound. They want power dialer. They're primarily outbound, and they need integrations with Salesforce. That's great, missus Prospect. I appreciate the time. It was lovely to meet you, but you need to be talking to Orem, SalesLoft, Outreach, and the like. Mhmm. We are not a fit here. Thank you so much. Should you ever have an inbound knee team or your support team needs to look at their tech stack, send them my way. Thanks. Have a great day. Awesome. What's number two? Number two is going to be the process we use for RFPs. We always hear about RFPs and proposals, but very rarely do we start to pull back the onion on what that process might look like. And right out of the gate, I think it's just as important to bring in the wider village Mhmm. To ensure you have multiple eyes on the proposal. The questions, the product gaps, the security, the compliance, all the different sections that are gonna be required for you to not only respond to the bid, but to move on to the next stage of the bid. And so I think bringing on the wider team, making sure you're honest with your assessment and answering the questions and making sure that you're doing your due diligence once you get to the discovery stage. So round us out. What's number three? So number three is going to be selling through the channel. Something we may or may not have heard about, something that might not even be relevant for most people. But to bring this to a a live actionable takeaway, think about the offices in the nineties and the early two thousands in Downtown New York City. Mhmm. You had a landline. You had cords going through into a data room. Your telephone system, your Internet system was on prem. Mhmm. Now we've moved to the cloud. Mhmm. However, all of those earlier telecommunications companies Mhmm. Had consultants Mhmm. That were a part of the deal cycles. Now that we've transitioned to the cloud, we've gone through our digital transformation. Those cloud consultants are still in place today. Yeah. So in contact center in particular, a lot of business is driven through the channel where you have a master agent and a sub agent. Mhmm. And those master agents and sub agents have relationships with CIOs, CTOs, chief member experience officers, and they bring the projects to you Mhmm. The same way an SDR might bring you a demo request or a talk to sales lead. Yeah. And so when you find yourself in this position, you have to work through the channel. Mhmm. You cannot work directly with the customer. Yeah. So it's important to not only understand the relationship of that agent Mhmm. But it's also important to understand what your competition is doing from spiffing Mhmm. Those agents. If you're two x and your competition is five x, you're gonna be out. So I wanna go back to this concept of looking to disqualify on the first call. I think the hard DQs are easy. If I saw that someone had a certain population of international employees or if I saw that someone was on a certain HR system that we couldn't support, that was easy. Pop in the DQ email, goodbye. The trickier ones are the soft DQs. Companies that are around a 100 employees, they might be starting to think about compensation planning, but the reality is it's almost never a big enough problem that they actually wanna pay to solve the problem. I'm sure you have something somewhat similar at Talkdesk where there's a slot of customers where they could buy your product, but they probably won't. I'm curious if you have an example there and if you can walk through how you'd approach a scenario like that. A lot of times, you'll find buyers come in, and they'll have a laundry list of requirements and need to have day one items. And maybe you can fulfill 95% of it, but the 5% is just as important of the rest of it. I found myself in a position when you're faced with that. You need to have an honest conversation with the buying team. You also need to find yourself in a position where you're reaching out to we have what's called our App Connect partners. Mhmm. Right? So we have an ecosystem of implementation partners and integration partners where maybe we don't do that 5% very well, but we have a partner who does. Mhmm. And so we'll bring them onto the deal. So we can we can own that 95%. Yeah. But maybe that 5% gap where we can't fill that and might DQ us Mhmm. We bring in the partner. But many times that instills a level of a lack of confidence in the buying team that we're out of our league. It's not something we can fulfill. We don't do it well. We have to bring in somebody else. Now am I dealing with a middleman when it comes to vendor management? So a lot of times we'll find ourselves in a position where it's a little bit softer of a DQ as opposed to right out of the gate. Yeah. We don't do that. Thanks, but see you later. I've I've often had to have DQ'd, opportunities because what we do to our core competency Mhmm. Was not the overwhelming majority of what was in scope and required of this project. Mhmm. And so you have to have an honest conversation not only with yourself, your sales leader, and maybe your second line leader, and just say, is this something that we really wanna gravitate towards or do we wanna let this go? How much of that do you suss out before you get on a meeting with them versus, like, do you suss out in, like, a pre meeting agenda or, like, pre meeting email? First and foremost, if we've identified something that we can't do, are we gonna disqualify this out? Are we gonna try and hang on to it? Mhmm. I think first and foremost, you need to get buy in and clear direction from your internal leadership. Yep. I mean solutions engineer, frontline solution engineering manager, your frontline sales leader, and maybe your VP or your RVP. And if everybody's on board, Johnny, we just can't fulfill this. Yep. We're gonna unfortunately have to bow out. This is just something we don't want a part of. Mhmm. And then we punt. Mhmm. Right? We let go of it. But sometimes there's that project and that logo that we wanna do what's necessary to win. Mhmm. And before we go ahead and and address a a soft DQ, we get on a call with a buying team and the agenda is going to be specific to that piece, that missing component. I had the opportunity to close the United Nations Federal Credit Union last year. An incredible logo for our product to Talkdesk. If you go to a credit union in Queens Mhmm. Or Long Island, let's say you go to Teachers Federal Credit Union in Long Island. That's for the immediate credit union community Mhmm. In Nassau or Suffolk County. The United Nations Credit Union, their member base is not New York City or Long Island City. It's the globe. Yeah. So they have all these end to end WebRTC requirements and translation requirements. Right out of the gate, when we looked at our RFP and our functionality, it was very easy to say, you know what, Johnny? We want the logo, but we're not sure. Mhmm. Right? This was an opportunity for us to discuss, hey. We understand you brought up this WebRTC component. Mhmm. How important and how relevant is this to your day one go live? Mhmm. And would this disqualify a vendor? Mhmm. And we had a call specifically with that subject matter. Once we identified that it was not a make or break, but it was something that is very much going to be a part of their future statement that if we didn't have it, it would make or break us, but it would certainly be weighted in the conversation. The down select a vendor of choice. And so I went to our most senior solution engineer at Talkdesk Mhmm. And identified who within our AppConnect ecosystem can execute on this end to end WebRTC. Mhmm. They what they wanna do is they want their members to pull up a live chat on their iPhone or their Android. And if they're going through a live chat conversation on the phone, this digital engagement ain't working. I wanna click to call through that live chat. Mhmm. That's what this App Connect partner was gonna do. So we brought on audio codes. We talked to audio codes separate from the customer. Mhmm. We ran discovery. Can you guys do this? They were like, absolutely. That's that's why we're hired by people. Mhmm. We put them in front of them. And the one small component we couldn't fulfill and we were ready to disqualify and punt and do a soft DQ email and let go of it, we brought audio codes onto the deal, and we ended up winning because of it. A lot of times, prospects will ask for a million features, but those features, they're not actually need to haves. They're nice to haves. But they're gonna ask. And oftentimes, they might make it seem like those are need to haves. How do you suss out which feature requests are really real versus ones where the customers are just being picky or asking you for nice to haves because they think you they can push you around? What I do is when I need to fizzle out between what's a nice to have and a need to have, instead of asking them directly is when I go to our pricing conversation Yeah. I know we've talked about all the bells and whistles and the nuances. I know they don't need that on day one, but I'm not gonna tell them that and they're not gonna tell me that. So when I go to show them pricing Mhmm. I'm gonna say, mister and missus buying team, mister and missus prospect, I thought we were gonna be here, but this is where we landed. And the cost avoidance is because of all those nice to have gimmicky products that we have Mhmm. That are nice and shiny. You don't need those on day one. So let's leave them off. And if they're okay with that pricing and they're okay with me leaving all those extra product add ons off, then I know that what I have on the current proposal, the first round is what they need and that this stuff is gonna impact that bottom line cost and that maybe it's not a phase one. Maybe it's not a day one. Maybe it's a phase two. Maybe it's a day two, day three item. So instead of asking them directly, I'll work with my team internally to identify what they need versus what they don't need on day one. Instead of asking them directly what's nice to have a need to have Yeah. I'll remove the fluff from the order form and look at their reaction and look at their response. That is really slick because you talked about this on your very first episode of 30 MPC. Your competitor is probably putting the bloated proposal that has every single bell and whistle, and it's a $4,000,000 proposal with a bunch of nice to haves. You're getting in front of them and you're saying, hey. I actually took some stuff off the table. This is only 1.5, and it's an easier decision. And prospects aren't always great at comparing apples to oranges, and your competitor looks way overpriced even though you might have been comparable if you had included all those bells and whistles. Absolutely. And I think another thing to take into consideration, a lot of the things that we consider add on products Yeah. And shiny bells and whistles and toys are baked into the cost of licenses of other people. So if I go ahead and put all that stuff on an order form and my direct competition is baking that into the cost of the license, they're seeing a $4,000,000 proposal versus a 1 and a half million dollar proposal. Understanding who your competition is Mhmm. On that particular deal is also gonna dictate what am I putting on there from a nice to have versus a need to have. You know, we always talk about land and expand, you know, get the basic stuff on there first. But in terms of identifying qualify versus disqualify, what's a need to have versus a nice to have item, I'm gonna listen. I'm gonna understand their business case. I'm gonna understand what it is that they're trying to accomplish, and I'm gonna leave the fluff off and see how they respond. It's so great because every prospect says they want every single appetizer on the menu. Yeah. But then if they actually saw what the check would be, they're like, I don't know if we need that fried calamari. And what you're doing is you're saying, hey. I got rid of the appetizers. This is a better check. You're now on the same side of the table as them from a pricing perspective. You look really awesome. And then if they kick and scream and say, no. I do want the shrimp cocktail. I do want the calamari. You can add it back in. But because they're seeing the quote and now it's real, they're far less likely to push for those nice to haves. So one bucket of where you might disqualify an opportunity is questionable fit with the product or what they want on a product. Mhmm. Another bucket that really commonly comes up is the problems are there, but they're not that big. If someone was managing their equity on spreadsheets, that usually became a pretty big problem once they started to raise funds. But if someone had an existing equity management solution, it might be annoying for them enough to take a second call, but they would almost never do a rip and replace unless something was horribly wrong. But you would chase them until the fifth, sixth, seventh call, and you would think that they would buy, but they would never buy. When someone is admitting to problems, but you get the sense that the problems aren't that big, how do you call that out? When the said prospect identifies that they have a problem, how is it impacting the business? How is it impacting your day to day? How is it impacting headcount? When I hear problem, those are all the items that I wanna point to. And if they can't effectively articulate any of that information, then I know it's not really a problem. Mhmm. They're kinda just window shopping around to see what else is going on. And that immediately, I can sniff that out quickly. And when they state that there's a problem and they've identified that there's a problem, how big of a problem is it? And how do you identify how big of a problem it is? I wanna know how does it impact your ROI, how does it impact your day to day, how does it impact your team, how does it impact your time? And if they can't answer those questions confidently, is it really a problem or you're just, like, slightly annoyed? So how do you call that out? I'll address it with them. They're using Google Voice and maybe some spreadsheets for reporting. Mhmm. And they're using Salesforce for their CRM. They integrate everything. Everything's fine. And they're sitting there looking at different vendors, Talkdesk being one of them. What are you faced with today? Why are we here today? Why did you request to talk to sales? When you spoke to my SDR last week, what prompted you to take that call? Mhmm. Why are we here today? And they're like, oh, well, we're just looking around because our organization is growing, and Mhmm. We feel like there's more out there. That's not a problem. They're they're window shopping. Maybe they're seeing some, you know, esoteric language on LinkedIn that's driving them to look at AI products and Copilot products and things of that sort. I see it all the time where organizations, a buyer, a project manager, maybe a director of operations, they come inbound Yeah. And they wanna learn more about Talkdesk, but there's no compelling event. There's no true pain. Mhmm. There's no true why. I think more more often than not, it's people that are bored Yeah. And they're just looking to justify their job by looking at different tech. I'm seeing a couple different camps. There's the total DQs that you're just saying, hey. Hard note, walk away. You're then trying to figure out with the other ones, like, is this a high conviction, great fit opportunity? Because as I understand it with those, you're getting the whole village to help you work and win that deal. But I have to imagine there's some where, like, it's on the first call, and it's not like they're giving you terrible answers and it's a a total hard DQ. But there's also, like, it's not like the, oh, yeah. We need to put everything we have into this one. When you've got those, like, medium conviction deals, are you still, like, giving them a proposal? Will you still put some resources towards them? And if so, like, how does that differ from the high conviction opportunities? Because one of the things that you said is not every opportunity gets the same amount of effort from your group. What does that look like when it's yeah, maybe we're throwing something at them? One thing that helps me with this specific point is understanding where we are priced Mhmm. In the market. So when I have somebody that's five seats, 10 seats, pre seed startup Mhmm. Not a whole lot of budget. When they see the ARR, when they see the professional services cost Mhmm. I know it's not gonna happen. Yeah. And I think what pains me the most in my position in being a commercial rep is when somebody comes inbound and it is a great fit Yeah. Almost to the tee. Yeah. But I know that where they are in the market, where they are from a pre seed stage perspective, where they are from a budget perspective, it's never gonna happen. What pains me is that a lot of these buyers come inbound, and I'm sure you see this in different industries too. You see a buyer come inbound and request a demo, they want all of the luxuries and nuances that come with a BMW seven series, but they want a Toyota Corolla price tag. Those are most challenging because you want the ACV, you want the logo, you wanna upsell it when it grows over the next year or two. I I DQ those deals on price. We get those all the time at thirty MPC where we get inbounds from seed stage sales tech startups that wanna advertise with thirty MPC, and our minimum sponsorship price is 75 k a year, and they cannot spend that. And so I used to take meetings and think, oh, maybe one in 30 of them might become a sponsor. It's not really worth my time. I'm sharing price expectations upfront with those ones where I can smell. We'd be a great fit for them, and I know we'd get them in front a ton of prospective customers for them. But, like, they're just not gonna spend that. So I tell them that up front. I'm like, I want you to know where this is. This will have an awesome impact, but this is not like your cheap $5,000 sponsorship. So I wanna set those expectations up front. If you wanna meet, great. But I wanna put that out there so we both save time if this is not gonna be a fit budget wise. And it allows me to reallocate those efforts into the great fit series d, series e sales companies. That's our bread and butter from a sponsorship perspective. We had a founder of a very large company. I'm not gonna name it here in New York City. Walked away. He's no longer the CEO. Yeah. He's on the board. Yeah. And he's going through the early stages of building another startup. Yeah. One of which, the one he just founded is extremely successful. He filled out the qualification form online. Yeah. We're talking two seats. He wants power dialers, Salesforce integrations. He wants the Bugatti Veyron of contact center, and he wants to pay Kia prices. And so when I saw that, I told the SDR, I'm more than happy to support you on a call. I'll make myself available. We'll have a conversation, and we'll go from there. Maybe there's something I can learn from this founder. Mhmm. Right? He's very intelligent. He's very successful. I'm actually interested in the way he's asking questions. I didn't immediately respond to it because I will almost ready to dequeue it. Well, because he's a founder of a large company, he emailed the CEO of my company and said your account executive is taking way too long to book this meeting. So my CEO and founder of Talkdesk got involved. And so I got on the call, ran discovery, immediately disqualified, and had to follow-up with the CEO of my company and just say, here are the specs. We're done. What do you wish you'd done differently? Well, for the sake of not putting myself on the CEO's radar, answer the, the form fill a little bit faster. But I think this was an opportunity to use the time to pick his brain. But in terms of doing things differently, being a professional, and attend to it in a timely fashion, the same way I would anything else, Problem is is that we have form fills and qualification forms for a reason. And when I look through it, I said this is a waste of his time and a waste of mine. Yeah. A simple email to d q it out would do it. And, unfortunately, he had immediate access to my CEO and, had to get on a call anymore. One thing that I found really helpful because I've had that backlog happen to me is sometimes an email that doesn't have an update, but it's just like an email saying, hey. I saw your thing. I'm gonna get to this. We'll mitigate a lot of those concerns with the buyer. I literally sent one last night at 11PM. We're here shooting, and I'm working an active deal, and I've gotta get something to one of our customers. And I sent her an email saying, hey. I want you to know. Haven't forgotten about you. I'm gonna get you something over the weekend. This is still on my radar, just setting expectations. And I got an answer right away being like, awesome. I was thinking about this and was wondering. Thanks for letting me know. Just reduced all of my stress and all of her stress. Goes a long way. I cannot stress the importance of that enough. And I think if the reps watching this or the individual contributors and account executives around the world are listening to this episode, right, if you take anything away from this episode, it's that. If you have a million and one things to do and there's maybe a smaller opportunity, smaller project that's not really gonna close right now, attend to them, give them five minutes of your attention. It can go a long way. Alrighty, Johnny. So let's take the same concept of hard DQs, soft DQs, and let's apply it to the RFP. You get an RFP. You're filling out your 400 line spreadsheet. And my guess is there are some where you're like, oh, god. Like, this is obvious. There's just no way we're the right provider. And so for those ones, it's an obvious DQ. When you get the sense that you're filling out meets some requirements for, like, half of the fields, What do you do in that situation where you're like, this feels like a lukewarm RFP? If 50% of the RFP is lukewarm and the other 50% is disqualified, I'm not even allowed to participate in the bid. But there are times where we've participated in the bid, and 25 to 30% of it was a little questionable. But what we do in those particular instances is we answer the object fields and the multitude of lines with very honest responses and that we have partners, an integration specialist, and an ecosystem of other software companies that can work alongside Talkdesk to facilitate X, Y, and Z. We don't do this natively. This is not who we are to our core competency, but we can bring in other partners that can facilitate this. Maybe using that as a soft DQ response as opposed to just blatantly saying no. What do you think the biggest mistake that AEs make in responding to RFPs is? Number one, not giving your organization enough time, room, and bandwidth, and runway to complete it accurately and correctly. Getting the right people involved from your proposal team, your solutions engineers, your solutions architects, your implementation specialists, everybody from the wider village that makes your deal successful needs to make the RFP successful too. The second thing that account executives perhaps drop the ball with is they're so eager to go to the next step and submit the bid Mhmm. That they forget to ask the necessary questions that you pull as a village from that RFP, what's potentially gonna disqualify us in later stages? Take those questions and when you get to the discovery round of the RFP process, make sure you're focusing on the red flag disqualification questions first. Because if you can address those, then you can be successful later. I've seen far too many times colleagues of mine here in my my last company where you stay away from the red flags, you stay away from the disqualification questions, and then it eventually catches up to them at the end. One of the things you might even be taking for a given that I think a lot of folks need to pick up on is you are getting this RFP, and you are using it as a reason to ask extremely targeted follow-up questions of, hey. You said you're looking for this. Is that because you're looking to solve a, b, and c? Or you said you need this. Is this because of a or x or y? Like, you're using the RFP as a way to run some degree of discovery. Oftentimes, you're not gonna be able to get on a meeting with them, but it sounds like you're getting your whole team to say, hey. Here's what we're reading between the lines from this RFP. Can you help fill some of this in for us customer? Is that right? Absolutely. And there's times where I'm invited to a blind RFP Yeah. And we don't have the ability to run discovery. If you have an opportunity to run discovery Mhmm. Between when the bid is released and when the bid is due, Please work with your solutions architects, your solutions engineers, all your product people Mhmm. To identify what you can accomplish from a product fit and what you can't. And what you can't or what's a little questionable, those are the questions you should be bringing to the discovery session, not the things you already know you can deliver. On. What do you do when you receive the RFP? Do you reach out and try to get a one on one conversation first? Do you fill it out and then reply and then ask for the one on one conversation? How do you get the questions behind the RFP questions? Typically, for us, when an RFP comes in, we have a list and a cover sheet that shows the instructions and the dates of the next steps leading up to the due date. Mhmm. So they'll say, okay. Qualifying questions due on this date. Discovery questions on this date. Discovery call on this date, and then bid is due on this date. I've never been in a position where a direct buyer has come to me, submitted an RFP, and then I can kinda just communicate in between. Mhmm. Typically, when RFPs come to us, it's coming through the channel Yeah. Which means we have to go through the consultant, the cloud consultant, the sub agent, or the master agent. We can't go to the customer directly. Not all lines in the RFP are created equal. How do you figure out what's actually important to the prospect in the RFP? So I think tying the questions in the RFP to what it is that your product does. If you're an EMR or an EHR in the health care space, if it's a banking core and financial services, if it's a CRM, disaster recovery contact center, you understand what you do well to your core competency and you understand when you pick away all the nuances and fancy shiny whistles and all the product add ons and you look at the core of what you do, you can pick out out of that RFP what is a need to have for that business to be successful because you know the industry, you know the landscape, you know what you do well. So you can start to piece together what about the RFP needs to be responded to, what's gonna be a requirement versus maybe what's a nice to have. I think understanding their industry and understanding what it is that your product does can help you understand what's going to be relevant in terms of need to have versus nice to have without even having spoken to the prospect yet. I'll give one good example on this is at Pave, it was compensation software we were selling. Mhmm. And oftentimes on RFPs, there would be a question about, are you HIPAA compliant, which talks about how you treat health care data. We do not handle any health care data whatsoever. And so HIPAA compliance literally means nothing for Pave. Mhmm. But if you just answer no, we're not HIPAA compliant, some buyers will freak out. So you need to take the time to educate your prospects on if you're saying no to something. You need to explain why this actually doesn't matter when you are evaluating compensation software because they're used to looking for HIPAA compliance on every single thing that they've ever bought. They don't always know that it doesn't matter for your problem space. Absolutely. We we have HIPAA compliance to a Talkdesk. If we get a bid from a health care organization or hospital system, what have you, and they ask about HIPAA compliance, we have to be very careful with how we word that because Mhmm. We have to position a product add on to ensure you have that s three bucket for the data storage, which then makes the contact center HIPAA compliant. But is the Talkdesk product to its core HIPAA compliant? No. So perfect example there where you actually have to learn how to position the correct language in the RFP to make sure you don't disqualify yourself. Johnny, clock's ticking. We gotta move to the final queue, which is this. We've talked about great things sellers should do. I wanna talk about a not so great thing. So the last question is what's one bad habit you see a lot of sellers exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? One bad attribute that I see across account executives is when they sit back and they don't have a favorable territory Mhmm. And they complain about pipeline. They complain about marketing. They complain about SDRs. They complain about the channel. They complain about trade shows. What What are we spending on marketing? What are you doing to fix the problem? What are you doing to prospect and build pipeline? What are you doing to go out and meet with customers and consultants and the like? What are you doing to dive into your patch? What are you doing to review leads and contacts and account history? What are you doing to get up to speed with the nuanced ways to prospect and break into accounts? And if the answer is nothing, stop blaming SDRs, stop blaming the marketing team, and stop blaming anybody else but yourself. Amazing episode. Johnny, you got me ready to go hit the phones. Thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a 60 recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap email from this episode with Johnny Larson. What do you have for your two? So the first one is if your prospect is trying to order every single appetizer on the menu and you know they don't really need all of those things, when you give them the proposal, give them the skinny down version and say, hey. I took some things off that I didn't think were gonna be absolutely necessary as a way to help you with some cost avoidance. What you'll do is, one, your proposal looks a lot better than the competitors of yours who gave the bloated proposal. And then two, if they really need that shrimp cocktail or some other appetizer in your proposal, they'll tell you, and now you can build that back in. Giving them price related to all of those asks makes things more real for them. Number two is when you get an RFP, this creates an opportunity for you to respond to said RFP, not with the full RFP responses, but with questions about their questions. Do not miss an opportunity to do some discovery in response to an RFP. Number three. There were two common signals for a disqualified opportunity that Johnny shared. The first is if you get the sense that your product really isn't the right tool for the job, call it out ideally before the meeting even happens. And then number two, if the problems are there, but they can't really explain why it's a problem and it seems like a nice to have, call it out as well. And then lastly, number four, if you are calling out a product gap and you're trying to pressure test it with your prospect, you might ask them this. Have you given any thought to what extent this would be critical to achieving whatever business outcome you wanna achieve and whether or not this would completely disqualify a vendor? If you still have a green light, you can move forward. If not, DQ the deal. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? Today, you don't have to help us out. Go help Johnny out. He went out of his way. He took a day off work. He got on a train and came all the way to meet you and me hanging out with us. But, seriously, Johnny has given so much expertise to thirty minutes to presidents club. He's a really, really awesome guy. If you got anything out of these episodes, go send him a note on LinkedIn.
