## Transcript

Here's the thing. When you have this big, hairy, audacious goal that you've put in front of your team and then you hit it, you start to change the belief that you have in yourself. I do cold plunges all the time. Sitting in 40 degree water for three minutes, it sucks every single time. But when you do it and you start out, you're like, I'm not gonna be like, I'm not gonna get it. And you stick it through. When that timer goes off and you get out, you're like, damn. I just did that. Now when I put another challenge in front of me, you say, you know what? I've actually got a whole history of things that when it was challenging, when I was afraid, when I didn't think I was gonna make it, I did and I became stronger for it. What else? This goal isn't just about the goal. This is about who you become by hitting the goal. The purpose of your vision, it's not necessarily that you achieve it. The purpose of your vision is who it causes you to be today. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. We timed it. I'm ready. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my ghost, Nick Skalski. And, folks, the reason we took a deep breath is because we have one of the most amazing cultural leaders we've ever had on the show. His name is Alex Kremer. If you're not familiar with him, he is part of the Marc Casaglow coaching family tree. He was one of the first leaders over at Outreach where he led the number one global sales team for multiple years in a row. He then led teams over at Catalyst as a director of sales, and now he's the founder over at Illuviance where he is coaching reps, leaders all over the place to master the inner game of sales. And he's one of the few people that can make culture, mindset, and just how to culturally lead a team actually actionable. So, Nick, why should people listen? Well, right. As you know at thirty MPC, we get extremely tactical, practical. And one one of the problems with that is there's very, very few guests that can actually come on and teach breakdowns of how you impact, like, the culture and the connection and the soul and the work ethic of your sales team. And the reality is that probably means more than any given sales tactic that you might use. And so in this episode, Alex takes just through all of the different places and techniques and things that he does to impact the culture and the heart and the soul of his team. Everything from how he runs his team meetings and sort of the unconventional way that he starts them, to what he does in his one on one meetings with reps, to what he does when he thinks he has someone who might be a flight risk. Alrighty, Alex. Welcome back to the leadership show. We start every show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Number one, presencing before the team meeting. You can do this in many different types of ways. You can do breath work. You can do stretching. And you can do a gratitude practice. But my favorite is box breath here. Box breath, essentially, this is how it works. You will bring presence to your team. You'll say, hey. Listen. I know you've had a lot of meetings before this. I know you've got meetings coming after this, but how we start this team meeting will set the tone for how everybody else engages, and you really want them to be there. What box breath is is you bring everybody into their presence, and you breathe in for four seconds. You hold for four seconds. You breathe out for four seconds and you hold for four seconds. Now you can do that for one round. You can do that for two rounds. My sweet spot it always is always three rounds and really what is going to say to your team, stop looking at Slack, stop looking at your email, exit out of LinkedIn, and come down here and be with your crew. I just exited out of my LinkedIn, and I'm now calm, and I'm ready for your second takeaway. Number two is get others on your team speaking up. The best and easiest way to kill your team meeting is you, as the manager, are talking the entire time. I do this in two different types of ways. Number one, I actually assign black belts on my team. So, really, what we'll do is there will be one person who's in charge of how are we tracking pipeline. There will be one person on our team who's in charge of any marketing initiatives. There will be one person on our team who's in charge of being the liaison between product and any updates that we have there. And every single time in our team meeting, when we get to that particular component, they will be sharing. Right? And then other reps on the team can go to them if they have any questions. What this will also allow you to do is to make it so that your team and the individuals feel like they're more than just a sales rep trying to hit quota. You're empowering them to be more a leader on the team. Second thing that I always do is the skill up level call. This is every single Friday where a rep will be on there and run a call that's either, hey. We want to listen to how I did this discovery call or this demo. Hey. I wanna walk you through an account plan I have and for you to give me coaching on it. Maybe there's a rep who does a really good job at demoing. I might actually work with that person to share and to teach the team on how they're demoing. Again, the whole goal for you as leader is make other leaders on your team. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. As long as Nick is not the one doing the demo. What's number three? Number three is how I structure my one on ones. I do this what's called people, pipeline, and big bets. The biggest problem I see for managers is they go on to one of the rep and say, what do you wanna talk about? You need to have a structure and a repeatable framework that then you can play within that framework. It gives the reps a certain sense of safety and certainty. So people is, hey, man. How are you doing? How's your heart? How's your vision? Are you feeling excited with what we're doing here? Is your mental health struggling? Let's really make sure that we acknowledge how are you doing. The second part is your pipeline. This is how are you actually hitting your KPIs? How many meetings are you booking? How are the account plans that you're creating and breaking into this? Right? We're always going to be tracking whatever KPI you're looking for, whether it be cold calls made or maybe it's meetings booked or any key accounts you're going into. The third one is your big bets. Now you will be going over, hopefully, all of the deals in your pipeline in a pipeline one one. This is different. This is saying, hey. You've got two or three big deals. And if we close these things, we're doing well this quarter. And so this is where we're gonna get more strategic on it. What's the problem we're trying to solve here? How are we getting multithreaded? Do we have any key risks that we're going? When are we going on-site? Right? This is to actually roll up our sleeves and look into this. So people, pipeline, and big bets. Before you even take me into the structure, can I actually ask about, like, how did you introduce it to the team in the first place? Because I bet we have folks listening who are like, I wanna do this, but we haven't been. And it's gonna be weird if I just show up, and I'm like, we're doing this thing. It actually started when I had one of my coaches challenge me. You know, I was doing retreats. I was getting coaching, all sort of stuff on the side. And then during the day, I was the tech sales guy, the tech sales leader. And he said, Alex, when are you going to combine these two different versions of you into just one single person? And he said, what's one thing you can do to that? And I was like, you know what? I've been doing so much breath work and meditation on my own. What if I brought that to my team? And I shared exactly that with my team. Hey, guys. I feel like I'm one person to you, and when I'm not at work, I'm a different guy. And I really wanna just wake up and say, I'm just gonna be Alex Kremer here, and this is what you get. Right? And so I really brought a level of authenticity and vulnerability of just being like, hey. I'm gonna be my authentic self, and it was an invitation to them to do the exact same thing, and it set the tone on the team of, oh, we don't need to wear the mask. We don't need to wear the armor. Let's just be raw and real of who we really are. After we do this initial breath work session, walk me through what happens through the rest of your team meeting. Team meetings, I love because they are sacred. If you are not putting thought and effort into your team meeting and you're just making it a check the box thing, you need to reprioritize how you're thinking about it. Because the only time for the majority of leaders during the week where you actually have everybody's attention. The first thing I will usually do is I'll share something that's top of mind, whether it's my why. It's like something that's in-depth. Right? Bring some heart. Bring some wisdom. Bring some meaning to what you're doing. It does not need to be long. It could be freaking fifteen seconds, but just bring a level of I'm more than just trying to hit our quota here. I'm also trying to make this a really powerful culture. Right? So that's the first thing. You know, for me this morning so I run a sales team right now as part of Alluviance. And this morning, I said, hey, guys. I was working out this morning, and I was thinking about two or three of the members who are in our community and the change that I've actually seen in their life since they joined us. And it just made me feel really proud, and it made me feel really excited that there's more potential people out there for us for us to go get meetings with and for us to potentially change their lives. So, like, I'm just gonna say that of, like, let's get after it this week. Right? So simple. So, dude, you're actually connected to your badass cause. If you guys don't know, Alex runs this organization called Illuviance, and they do all types of amazing things to help sales reps and other professionals master the inner game of sales, whether it's retreats, immersions, what have you. What if I sell cybersecurity software? I'm like, we we're gonna bash a lot of bugs this week, guys. It's gonna be a good week. You know, you have to connect the dots to what is the true impact that you're making. And sometimes you need to actually pull that thread a little bit more. Right? I'll give an example, and maybe it's not the cybersecurity, but I'll give an example to Outreach. Right? It wasn't just a fact of we need to sell more sales engagement platforms to x, y, and z companies. We said, cool. If we do that, what's going to happen? The reps who use our platform, they will be more effective at their role. That probably means that they'll be more effective at being able to hit their quota. And we all know that when you hit more quota, what do you feel? You feel more purpose. You feel more confident. You feel more aliveness. How does that mean then you show up at home? You probably show up at home, right, more excited. Right? You can probably buy your family things. You can take your partner out on a really cool vacation. Right? Let's remember those people that we are impacting. That's and, again, that took, like, two or three or four kinda pull the thread to talk about who is the end user that we are impacting and how are we making their life better. Right? Cybersecurity, man, we're making people feel safer. When you feel safer, you can be more relaxed. When you feel more relaxed, you can show up better with whoever it might be. Right? And sometimes it takes. Like, let's really remember who it is that we're serving. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show show notes. Alex, you've talked a lot about it's not enough to just do pipeline reviews and land your deals on time. There's this hidden magic that happens when you're not looking, when the reps feel like they're attached to a leader or a team that has a vision. I wrote down a couple different levels of vision or meaning. So the first is what you described, which is meaning in your work. Right? So you're doing very meaningful stuff at Elluviance. If I was working for a nonprofit, that would be very meaningful work, and the work alone is enough to derive vision and meaning from it. The second level up is another one that you described, which is at outreach. There's a lot of personal meaning. So if the team succeeds, that means a lot for the individual. Maybe that helps that person buy a car. Maybe that helps that person send their kids to school. When I was selling insurance, we would do these things called design statements, and they would have you build out, like, what hitting a certain premium goal this year would allow you to do in your personal life for your kids, for your family, for yourself, for the people around around you. So that's the personal meaning. Then the third one is in sales teams, if you can find a way to give your team company meaning, at Pave, one of the things that was really helpful for us is we would paint this, like, against all odds narrative where we would be looking down the barrel of, like, a ridiculous revenue goal, and we would tell the story around how there's no reasonable reason any single sales team in the world should be able to hit that goal, but we're gonna be the crazy mothers who actually hit that goal. And that alone created this, like, crazy locker room feeling where people were ready to run through a wall and jump head over heels. So I don't know what it is for whoever's listening right now, but find some way to get your reps fired up about either the work they're doing, around what it means for them personally, around how they can be attached to a company or team goal. And that will get people doing the right things in their deals because they're actually sprinting. They're not dragging their feet. Here's the thing. When you have this big, hairy, audacious goal that you've put in front of your team and then you hit it, what else becomes possible? Right? Because here's the key thing. When you put this thing in front and you end up doing it and crushing it, what changes? The identity that you start to show up. You start to change the belief that you have in yourself. I've talked about this before, but I do cold plunges all the time. We do cold plunges at our retreats all the time. Sitting in 40 degree water for three minutes, it sucks every single time even when I still do it today. But when you do it and you start out, you're like, I'm not gonna be like, I'm not gonna get it. And you stick it through. When that timer goes off and you get out, you're like, damn. I just did that. Now when I put another challenge in front of me, you say, you know what? I've actually got a whole history of things that when it was challenging, when I was afraid, when I didn't think I was gonna make it, I did, and I became stronger for it. What else can I do? Right? So I love that. It's like this goal isn't just about the goal. This is about who you become by hitting the goal. The last thing I'll say is the purpose of your vision. It's not necessarily that you achieve it. The purpose of your vision is who it causes you to be today. What's that version of you that could hit the goal? What time do they wake up? How do they commit to becoming a better sales How do they treat their partner? What do they put in their body? Do they work out right? Let's actually start to understand what's that version of me like, and how do I essentially embody that today and know and trust. As long as I embody that, I'm gonna get to where I'm trying to go or open up doors I did not even know was possible. So after you do the initial vision or the wisdom, what do you transition into next? You know, I'll do shout outs. And the key thing that I like to do for the shout outs is just be like, hey. Who had a great week of pipeline? Who closed a big deal? Sometimes I'll actually give a shout out to somebody who lost a deal, but they showed up really strong and they did as best they could. And I'm gonna give them the opportunity to share more about what they did or why they did it or what they learned from it. Get your team speaking. So shout outs is number one. Then I'm gonna talk about the key things that I always need to as leader. Right? I'm talking about, hey. What's our revenue goal? How are we tracking to it? What does that mean that we need to hit from a revenue pacing perspective this week, this month, you know, whatever it might be. Then always, I talk about pipeline. If you're not talking about pipeline in every single one of your meetings, you're doing it wrong. Here's the thing, though. Do not have a new metric every single week. If you wanna be tracking cold calls, awesome. Do that every single week. If you wanna be tracking meetings booked, awesome. Do that. If you wanna be talking about how big of a pipeline you have, awesome. Do that every single week. Because if you show a specific dashboard and a person is at the bottom of that dashboard every single week, they're gonna be like, okay. I gotta not be at the bottom of this. But if you show a new dashboard every single week and sometimes at the top, sometimes at the bottom, they can't win. Right? You wanna be consistent there. After that, we'll go and do any key updates, marketing initiatives, product updates, anything like that. And then my last is, like, what's going on with the team? And this is where I will usually invite specific people to share, hey. Any personal updates, any key deal updates? Right? This is the variable that, like, what do we want this meeting to be about y'all? You mentioned it earlier. You talked about reenrolling your team in, like, the vision and mission of the company. What do you do when you have someone who assuming you want to keep this rep. You're like, this is someone who's, like, a valuable member of our team. We want them on this team, but you feel like they're drifting, they're pulling away. You think they might be looking for another job. They're in a slump. What do you do when someone's not enrolled and not where you know they need to be? You know, I had this with, our top rep when I was at Catalyst, and he'd been there for a while. And, you know, he was a natural leader on the team, and I could tell that his energy was just like, whatever. I'm just gonna be here, try to get mine, and maybe he was looking for another job. And I had a one on one with him, and I called it out. I was like, hey. Listen. You're a top rep here. What's most important is that when you speak, people listen. There are certain times where I feel like I I don't know how to coach you because I don't know what you want. If you're okay with it, I like to take the guard down here because I wanna make sure you're happy and fulfilled and you're getting the results. What do you want? What would actually make you feel like you're at that 10 out of 10, I freaking love this. And what would make you feel like I gotta get the hell out of here? You know, we talk about this all the time when we're teaching salespeople how toluvience. It's like, if you spot it, you, like, share it. We try to put on this bravado. We try to, like, manipulate and, like, try to skirt around the bush. Call it the freak out. You're a top rep here, and I'm not feeling you in like you want to. And I wanna get you to where you're feeling a 10 out of 10. What do we have to do? Is it me? Is it you? Is it this company? You tell me. Create a level of just, like, safety of a container. It's like, let's just drop into what's real here. I think it's the biggest flaw that we have in our show some ways. I think it's one of the things that Arman and I talk about sometimes. We're like, we really, really focus on, like, the actionable tactic. What's the skill you're gonna do? And I think we both know that so much of it is, like, some of the in more intangible stuff that you've talked about. Like, does the team believe? Do they believe that you care about them? It's like the culture. It's the tenor. It's the feeling. And there's very few people, Alex. You're one of them who can actually, like, talk about it in a practical, tactical way. So I guess one more question for you before we move to the final queue. You've talked about a lot of things to, like, get the team bought in, feel like everybody can bring their full self. You're bringing your full self. Are there other places that you're doing this that are notable that we didn't talk about? We talked about the team meeting, the one on one. We talked about the departure conversation. Are there other, like, big moments where this comes up? With my boss. I have two bosses in particular who I greatly respected. Mark Kosklo, who both you guys know, who is a speaker on this, or or a host on this, and then a guy named David Rubinstein, used to be an executive at Salesforce. Both of those guys coached me to be a better sales leader and a sales professional than really anybody in my entire life. They believed in me. They believed in Iluviance even before it was a thing. They they trusted in me. But the thing that they really allowed was for me to coach up. I was able to give them direct feedback. I was able to tell them when they were coming too hard and they are focusing too much on the numbers. I was able to tell them when they were having a new flavor of the week. Right? And it created this deeper level of trust that I felt safe as the leader with my boss. Mhmm. And therefore, when I felt safe upwards, therefore, I felt more confident and safer going downwards. Right? But that takes two to tango. It takes a certain level of, like you know, there's so many sales leaders that's like, listen to me. Do what I say, and if you don't believe in what I say, get the hell out. You wanna talk about burning a bridge or or losing creativity. That's the easiest way to do it, but I call it dynamic leadership. How do you make it so that you as the leader are allowing yourself to be led by the people who you are the manager for? Right? And sometimes, the easiest way to allow others to lead is for them to coach you. Right? Sometimes the easiest way for you to be led and to empower your team into their leadership is for you to bring a deeper level of vulnerability and authenticity about ways that you're struggling, about ways that you're questioning, about ways that, man, I'm just working my ass off. I was talking to the sales leader the other day, and he's like, man, I'm really tired. I was like, does your team know? He's like, I would never tell my team I'm tired. I was like, Why? It's like we think as sales leaders, we're required to have this armor, this mask of I'm great, and I'm always great, and I'm always so enrolled into the vision of this company and all this sort of stuff. And if you are, tell me what your diet is because that's just not what it is. I I started a company two years ago that's coming from my freaking soul and my heart, and I feel so much purpose with it. And I doubt it. I get burnt out. Out. I question it. Right? And so it's just the human experience. And when you, as the sales leader, both upwards and downwards, can just, like, be like, man, it's not always awesome. And sometimes it's actually a lot less than just than bad. Let's call it that. And that's okay. And you're gonna invite other people into their leadership, and it's gonna create this group dynamic where they're like, damn. I'll fight for this guy. I'll fight for this woman. Every time you get on this show, I'm dead serious. I leave feeling super fulfilled and energized from these recordings because I actually feel like we connect with you and we talk about the real human beings that are leading the sales floor, and that's what actually helps people lead teams the right way. So we have to move to the final question. And I'll put a slight twist on it for you, which is we talked about a lot of good habits that sales can exhibit when creating culture on their sales team. But what is the biggest cultural mistake that a sales leader can make that sets teams back a couple of notches? Can I get two? Yeah. Number one, you make it all about money. Now that's not meant to say don't think about money. Most people are in sales because they wanna make a shit ton of money. Right? I wanna have that 500 k year. I wanna hit that 7 figure year or whatever it is that you're trying to go for. That's important. And it's not all about that, especially right now in 2025 as we're going closer to 2030 as millennials and Gen Z ers are becoming more in the workforce, people want meaning, and they want community, and they wanna make shit ton of money. Right? So just, you know, bring in this flavor of how do you give people level of fulfillment and purpose. The way that you do that as a sales leader is you coach people how to be better at their tactics, and you coach them how to be a better version of themselves. That's the first one. The second one, don't forget to coach your top reps. In fact, coach them freaking hard. I think I even said this on a previous podcast that I was with you guys. I remember watching The Last Dance, and one of the coaches said about Michael Jordan. The biggest respect that you can give to the best player in the world, you coach him freaking hard because you don't want him just to be great. You want it to be extraordinary. Right? And so don't forget those top reps on your team that are hitting a 100% plus of quota. They still got a lot of work to do. And if you forget them, they're gonna say, I'm too good. I'm looking elsewhere. I wanna be growing better. So coach your top reps hard. For anyone still listening, we're gonna put a couple Easter egg questions here in the back of the episode, so have fun with these. What is the number one hiring mistake a sales manager can make? You hire someone who has just the right experience. And what I mean by that is I want somebody more than anything who's hungry, who's got grit, who wants to freaking get after it. That beyond anything is going to make my job a hell of a lot easier because you can teach people stuff. You can teach people the product, the industry, whatever it might be. You cannot teach people how to be hungry. And if you're only hiring based on experience or what their resume says, you're gonna hurt the culture of your team. What is the number one sales interview question you can ask a rep? My number one interview question for a sales rep is what's your mission statement? Because I'm actually trying to understand a deeper level of the why. And, also, what I'm trying to understand there is their emotional intelligence. Do they actually go deeper than they know how to say the right things and answer the right things and do exactly I'm actually trying to get them to say, are you self aware? Do I actually connect with you? Do I feel a sense of meaning and purpose in what you're saying? Right. I can ask the questions about what's your quota attainment, how do you think about pipeline, what do you do, how to multi thread, all that sort of stuff. And that's just like check the box, check the box, check the box. What people can't prepare for is let me freaking feel you. Because if I can feel you, your prospects are gonna feel you. If I'm an SDR and I wanna get promoted to AE, what are you looking for as a sales manager? Do the job already. Number one, hit your quota. Number two, start to get coached by an account executive. Start practicing disco and mock calls with them. Number three, start talking to all the different managers of the different segments. Account executive sales leader, talk to the solution consultant sales leader, talk to the marketing sales leader, talk to the demand gen sales leader, all these different people, and ask them this question. I'm here to share with you all the reasons why I can be great at this job, but what's most important for me here is what do you look for in an account executive who steps into this role that would be most beneficial for you? And, really, I just allow them to start talking it up, and I say, cool. And I can ask follow-up questions and give my little pitch at the end. But the last question I'll always ask is I'm about to go for this position. And when it's time to give your recommendation on whether or not you think I'd be a good fit, you think you can raise your hand and say, I think he'd be great. Are you open to that? Your first deal you will ever sell is getting multithreaded within your organization why you should be closing the deal of moving into this account executive position. Last one for you. What is the number one thing that makes a great sales leader? They're doing work on themselves. They're committed to their journey. They're always committed to becoming a better sales professional themself. They're committed to mean what it means to be a great sales leader. They're committed to actually stepping in to a deeper level of inner work within themselves to feel a level of vision. What a great sales leader is in 2025 is a lot different than what it was in 2018. Right? A great sales leader is committed to the craft and their own inner work themselves. Because when you do that, you're naturally gonna be able to coach people. You're naturally gonna be able to make people a better seller because you first are embodying yourself. You can only take somebody as far as you've gone yourself. So do the work on yourself. That's what makes the best sales leader. Alex, amazing show. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Jason Bay. What do you have for your two? So my first one was a really powerful quote that he shared, which is the purpose of your vision is who it causes you to be today. The way that I thought about that was your vision or your rep's vision informs the actions that you take right now because those actions are designed to bring you towards what that vision you see is. So really powerful quote. I liked that one. My other takeaway was almost every quarter, Alex is asking his reps some version of the question, like, why are you at this job, or why are you at this company? Not to push them away, but to understand what's their why, what's their commitment, what's their level of enrollment with their current employment working with you. The five part framework to run a team meeting without losing your soul. Start with breath work, number one, then wisdom slash vision, number two, shout outs, number three, track revenue, number four, and then pipeline and KPIs. The tactical stuff is at the end. And then lastly, number four, nominate black belts for different disciplines of skills, and then have them run the trainings. And I promise you nine times out of 10, your reps will listen more. The reps who are teaching the stuff will learn the stuff better, and you will spend less time training and more time leading from the front. Alrighty, folks. Nick, how should people help us out? So if you like that little Easter egg where Arman asked Alex a bunch of those questions, are we doing a lot of those with our guests? We're gonna stitch them all together on our Instagram. And so if you're looking for more 30 MPC goodness, go check us out on Instagram. You'll see more of those stitched clips. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
