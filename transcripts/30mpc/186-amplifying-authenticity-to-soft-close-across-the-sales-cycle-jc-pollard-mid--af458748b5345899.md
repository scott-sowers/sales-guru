## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sejgalski, and, oh, man, top AE at Gong, JC Pollard. Nick, why should people listen? Well, JC actually knows how to book a meeting using the magic device called the phone. He is a cold calling expert. This was a great one because Arman and I talk about cold calling a lot and best practices for cold calling. And, like, JC just he explains it in a different way. And so if you wanna get better at booking meetings on the phone, listen to this one. And then if you wanna figure out how to soft close at multiple times throughout your deal process, JC also knows how to do that. And a three, a two, a one. Do you wanna listen to this episode? Until you say yes, I'm not playing it. Yes. Thank you. Three, two, one. Let's do it. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, JC. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Awesome. First one I wanna talk about is asking permission throughout the entire sales process to do different things. That might mean asking permission to stay on a cold call a little bit longer or asking permission to ask a really challenging question. Quick example of this is the amount of time somebody's been trying to push me off a cold call. Things are starting to go the wrong direction, and I'll just hit him with a question like, hey. I know it's a little annoying, but do you mind if I just ask you, like, three more quick questions, and then I'll let you get back to your day? You get their buy and you get their permission to keep talking, and that completely opens the door for you to continue the conversation and discover things that might allow you to end up booking that meeting in there. I know it's a little annoying, but could I get your permission to get tip number two? I suppose I could give you a second tip. The second thing I wanna talk about is recognizing the fact that our buyers have probably not bought us before, but we've sold our stuff a lot of times. So it's about proactively outlining the buying process throughout the entire sales cycle. And that shows up in a bunch of different ways, like setting strong agendas, making recommendations for next steps as opposed to leaving it up to your buyer on where they wanna take it from there. Quick example of this is at the end of a call saying, hey. There's typically two ways that buyers who are excited about Gong like to take it from here. Do you mind if I outline those two options, and you can let me know what makes the most sense in your world? Beautiful. Write us out. What's number three? Number three is probably my favorite and the thing I'm most excited to talk about, which is soft closing throughout the entire sales cycle. As opposed to waiting till one big scary go no go call, constantly trying to close the deal at multiple touch points throughout the deal cycle, Hopefully, this helps save you time. And, ultimately, when you hear no after trying to soft close someone, it allows you to uncover what's actually standing between that no and a yes so you can expedite the process. Alrighty, folks. JC's taken us from cold call to close. JC, you're a cold calling machine, so let's take this one from the top. How do you open your cold calls? I like opening my cold calls in whatever way I feel like on that day based on my mood. The key is I want it to feel authentic, and I wanna have a ton of conviction when I do it. So if I'm cold calling Nick on a Friday, it might be like, Nick, happy Friday. I'm sure the thing you wanna do more than anything in the world right now is sit on the cold call. But putting that aside, could I very briefly explain why I'm standing between you and your weekend? It's like delivering energy, and it's standing out, and it's sounding authentic. And then it's still getting permission to briefly explain why. Hopefully, you say yes, and that's when you can really launch into, like, a well researched reason for actually calling them. But I I would argue that the majority of cold calls fail in that first thirty seconds. You have to sound like you want to be on that call because the likelihood is the person on the other end of the phone probably does not want to be on that call. So if you don't deliver the energy, I don't know how you could expect them to. Something that I like to do is stand up on my cold calls and kind of pace around and smile and just pretend that I'm actually having a conversation with a human in real life. Being yourself and whatever tonality that they're like is authentic to you, put that into a cold call, and you'll get a lot more people willing to stay on the line with you. So help give me a sense of, like, how that extends to the next piece of the call. I go, yeah. You know, I've only got a second. I'm actually supposed to meet my my friend, Armand, for dinner, so I gotta leave in a second. But what's this about? Where do you take it from there? Yeah. That's the next component, and that's the part that you have to be really ready to deliver on. I like to incorporate what's called a three by three, which is three concise reasons that you're actually calling them. So in the example of the sales leader, I'd be like, hey. I noticed you just launched a new product and some new go to market messaging along with that. I also saw you're actively hiring for three AEs. And correct me if I'm wrong, it looks like you were a former Gong user at your last company. Based on that, I'm curious how familiar are you with what we do. So it's three very distinct, well researched, and tailored reasons that you're calling that specific person. It's kind of like, oh, you've actually put an energy to know who I am. I'm gonna give you a little bit more time because of that. So this is super interesting. So you are giving three pieces of research. You're not saying the problem you solve. You're not saying what you do, etcetera. You're just giving the three pieces of research. You're stopping and asking if they're familiar with you. And then I assume they either say, yes. I'm familiar with you. Right? I I've heard of Gong. Or they say, no. I haven't. My guess is if you're selling to someone that isn't already on, like, a call recording platform, they might be, like, totally oblivious to what's going on in this space. So what happens when someone says, no, JC. I I haven't heard of you, or I'm I'm very loosely familiar. Yeah. In this situation, I would be like, well, I know you're about to meet your friends, so time is limited. But could I have, like, thirty five seconds to explain what Gong does? If it's relevant, we can set up some time to talk more in-depth in the future. If not, let me know, and I'll let you get to your weekend. And notice how I'm already planting the seed that the next step here is setting up a demo. So it's kind of like a soft close in the cold call already outlining, like, where ideally we're taking it from here as opposed to waiting till the end of the call to ask for time. And then, ideally, they're giving me permission to launch into my actual Gong pitch. Well, two intentional things that I see that you're doing here. One, you did a callback to what I said earlier, which, again, makes it feel human, makes it feel fun. That is important. I think sometimes folks get so rigid with, here's how the call's gotta go that they forget to be like, you're supposed to meet your buddy. Like, I hope you're gonna get something good. Anyways, can I get thirty five seconds? Also, I like that you called out the fact that the intent of this When I would call a CFO of a law firm, that person had worried that I was about to drag them through a seventeen minute discovery call on the cold call. And when you say, hey. The reason I'm calling isn't to take up a ton of your time. It's to figure out if we should talk. That changes their perspective from, I gotta get this guy off the phone to, okay. I'm gonna give him the thirty five seconds to figure out if we're gonna meet. You're showing that you're gonna respect the interruption that you are making right there. So they say, yeah. You got thirty five seconds. The clock's ticking. What's the pitch sound like going back to those, like, three pieces of research you did? How do you tie that to your pitch? Yeah. And something I wanna call out here is if you have one pitch that you're delivering to every persona you call, you're probably missing the mark somewhere. So I have a very specific pitch that is dedicated to the different kinds of people I'm calling. If I'm calling a customer success leader, it's gonna sound nothing like my pitch to a sales ops leader, etcetera. So in this case, where the example is they're like a VP of sales, they're scaling the team, they're launching a new product, My pitch is usually problem first, quick snippet of how Gong solves for this, and then asking how that resonates in their world. So, Nick, a lot of the sales leaders I talked to today are having a really hard time identifying how their new product is landing in the market because they're so far removed from the front lines. And there's also a massive challenge with getting new reps up to speed quickly in the remote world. Gong solves for this by analyzing and capturing all of your customer interactions so you know exactly how this product lands and know what top performers are doing differently. Curious. What part of that specifically stands out in your world or resonates with you? Short, concise, problem based, talking very little about our actual solution. Just trying to understand, like, is this even relevant in their world? Unpack that closing question at the end. You're not asking, hey. Do you want a meeting? Not asking, is that interesting? You're asking which part of that resonates with you the most. Yeah. The biggest key is that it's open ended, and it's not opening the door for them to say yes or no. And it's it's pushing them into one part of the funnel. So by asking, like, what part of that specifically resonates, it's really hard to say none of it when you ask it that way. And so they're likely gonna lean into what part of that pitch was the most relevant in their world, which allows you to do a little bit of deeper discovery and then ultimately just book a meeting out of it. That's one thing that I try to do on my cold calls, especially now that I'm a full cycle AE and I'm the one that'll be taking the next meeting. I don't wanna spend twenty minutes on the cold call. Like, if I'm calling somebody who I know is a good fit and something stands out, I'm trying to get them booked on the demo as fast as I can and get on to the next call. I'm curious. If we zoom in on the part of the call we're talking about specifically, you just gave your tailored pitch and you asked which piece resonated the most with them. Can you talk to me about, like, maybe one or two of the most common areas of friction or hiccup around there and then how you actually overcome it? Yeah. I think the the first thing is people that will say, none of that resonates, not focus on anything that in an effort to just get out of the call. I try to be authentic in myself on all these calls, so I'll be like, Nick, really? Like, none of that stood out at all, not even slightly a little bit. And just kinda lean into my my personality, my humor, and hope to get them to open up a little bit. The second thing I'd say is people that are like, oh, yeah. We already have something in place for that. So this is where that thing I mentioned, like, asking permission throughout the entire process. This is where I'll leverage that. Because I think the natural thing to do is ask them, like, what are you using, or how are you using your current solution? That's, like, really annoying for a buyer. If they think they already have what you're selling, but they don't want to stay on the call and tell you what they're using. So I'll immediately ask permission. I'm like, hey. That's amazing. I'm glad to hear you have something in place because these are are really big challenges. Do you mind if I ask you, like, two or three quick questions, and then I will let you go back to your day? So I'm getting that permission first, and then my questions will be probably, like, where your head goes, which is like, I'm curious. How are you how are you leveraging the solution you have in place to understand every single time your reps are pitching your new product? And the likely response is that they're not actually using the solution in that sense, or they may not even be aware that they can. It's interesting because if you just try to ask the questions like, what vendor are you using, you're essentially asking questions to get to the point where you can ask a better question. And someone on a cold call isn't willing to put up with that time. And so you need to have some offer value or you just need to call out the fact that I'm gonna take more time. The approach that I've taken on these is is somewhat similar where when I know someone's on a competitor, I don't wanna waste a question being like this one. All you should say, like, hey. My guess is you're probably not gonna switch. Every once in a while, it makes sense to switch off one or two providers. Can I ask you, like, two questions and give you a sense of if it might even make sense to look at us or you should never look at someone like us ever again? So that's if they do have a solution in place. So let's say that you have someone who's open to taking a call with you, but they're giving you the traditional swaths of not now or no budget or call me in six months or send me some information. All of those are basically just delaying the yes. What do you do in those types of objections? When I am specifically calling sales leaders, I like to play into the humor a little bit. And if a VP of sales like this is interesting, call me back in six months. I'll be like, Armand, like, what would you tell your reps to say if the sales leader pushed them off six months? And just kinda lean into that. But I think the the easy answer is, like, I just always ask questions. Like, hey. Six months sounds like a pretty specific time frame. I'm curious. Is there, like, some big initiative going on over the next half of the year, or are you really not that interested in this meeting and just wanna push me off? So it's just asking questions to try to understand, like, is that even a real objection? Are they not interested at all? Like, what's the reality of of what they're saying? I wanna talk about some of, like, those other common swats or objections that you probably get where it's like people are like, yeah. I've heard of Gong, but I've heard you guys are really expensive. You know? Our budgets are frozen right now. I think the theme you'll hear here is, like, I try to be myself, and I love using humor and personality in my calls. I'll be like, hey. Can I level with you real quick? I get permission. I'll be like, if I only close deals where people have allocated budget for Gong, I would have been fired after, like, three months. There is never a world in which people are like, we have all this money we wanna spend. Typically, the way we get there is by showing when there's a need, making a very tight business case, and then ultimately, the spend becomes a no brainer. And then I'll kinda go from there. But I I pretty much outline the fact, like, nobody ever has budget. Nobody sets out to spend. I don't think I've ever closed a deal where someone's like, we have $80,000 that we have set aside for Gong from the get go. Let's buy. So I kinda just lean into that. One more really tough scenario. You give your opener. They hang up on you. What's your response? So I'm a I'm a pretty aggressive cold caller, and so I'll call them right back. And if they pick up, I'll be like, hey. I think the the connection might have cut out or the line must have dropped, and go from there. And then if not, if I call them back and they don't answer, I'll usually send an email with, like, hey. Not sure if the line got dropped or if what I was saying wasn't interested in, and then and then go from there. But, like, a hang up is not the end of the world because sometimes people feel guilty and feel like they owe you something after. So you can kinda leverage that for additional outreach, but the first thing I do is call them right back. JC, I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of the audience. So the first thing that comes to mind that I might have as an objection because nothing ever works apparently is that, oh, this only works for selling to sales leaders, and this is incorrect. Your style is very similar to the style that I had with CFOs, and I would ask CFOs how can I get budget from the cheapest guy in the room, which is you? And so this totally works. The other objection that I'm hearing really commonly today is that with whole post COVID everyone working from home, it's really, really hard to get phone numbers for people. And so I'm curious. It seems like you're pretty heavy on the phones knowing that a lot of the traditional phone number sources might not be as reliable or connect rates are down. Do you have any creative tactics for getting direct dials, for making sure that you spend as much time talking to people as humanly possible? I'm hesitant to share this because I don't want every other AE and SDR in the world to know about it. But there is a version of White Pages, the phone book online, and it is by far the most accurate source I've found for mobile numbers. So looking up somebody by their name and the the city in which they live, you can find mobile numbers. You can find physical addresses for physical gifting. It's been an absolute godsend in in terms of, like, this is a top prospect. They're not information isn't on lead IQ or RocketReach or whatever. Like, I need to find them. It's been a pretty awesome resource, but don't use it. It's mine. I wanna talk about that, the first objection that you outlined because I've I've heard that a lot when I I post a lot on LinkedIn about, like, creative emails I've sent in a lot of comments like this only works for sales leaders. Like, my personas would never respond to that. Like, my response to that is, like, I bet you it works. Like, my first SDR role out of college, I was selling to chief medical officers and chief technical officers at hospitals during a pandemic. And the one thing I found success with was authentic, personality driven cold calls. I honestly think the things that I've been talking about stand out even more in those industries because that's not the way most people do outreach and interact. It's like everyone buys into the fact that if I'm selling to CIOs, I have to be serious and not new personality. So I think it actually differentiates you even more if you continue to lean into them. The number one sign that I've seen with reps who come off as junior is they're overly stiff. They're afraid to show their personality, and you can spot it. And executives, if you look at how they talk to each other, they're slapping each other on the shoulder. They're being casual about their their language as well. And the problem is everyone is talking to them like they're afraid of them. And if you're the one person who shows up and breaks the pattern, you'll get a look from some of them. They're like, I can't believe this guy just said that, and they'll respect you for it. JC, I wanna take this concept that we've had in cold calling, which is just being extremely direct, disarmingly blunt, whatever you wanna call it, being authentic. So I wanna take this concept that you mentioned earlier called soft closes. Right? As you're soft closing throughout the sales cycle, my guess is you're also being pretty direct in asking the person whether or not what you're doing is meeting the mark. So let's go into, like, a discovery call environment. Can you give us a sense of where are some of the common soft closes occurring well before the next steps portion of the call? Yeah. So the it all starts with the agenda and upfront contract and outlining early on that, like, one of the potential outcomes to this call is that you are ready to buy. So my upfront contract typically sounds like, hey. There's there's three ways this call could potentially go. The first is I show you Gong, and you're like, we needed this yesterday. In which case, we can talk about what a contract would look like and how we get this in your hands ASAP. Second outcome is you're excited but need to see more, in which case, we'll set up like a deep dive demo, bring another stakeholders. Third option is I missed the mark. You hate Gong, and we never talk again. I hope that's not the case, but just be honest with me if that is. So I'm already setting expectations upfront that one of the potential outcomes is they can just buy my software. And then at the end of the call, I like to ask permission. I'll be like, hey. Nick, can I can I level with you? Hopefully, he says yes. I'm like, hey. Based on our conversation, sounds like you have three really pressing needs, and the impact of those needs is, like, $400,000 in additional revenue. Feels like we've mapped exactly how Gong can solve for those. I know at the beginning of the call, it outlined three potential outcomes. To me, it feels like we're at a one. Am I way off the mark there? And that's literally a soft close. You're asking, like, are you at a one? Are you ready to buy? They're probably gonna say no, and then you're able to ask. Awesome. No worries. Sounds like we'll set up a deep dive demo. I'm curious, though. What else do you need to see that would get you to that level of confidence where you are ready to buy? Talk to me about the types of responses that you'll get when you ask that number one question. Yes. I I had a call yesterday where the CRO shows up to the call. It's supposed to be a forty five minute deep dive demo. He gets on. He's like, hey, JC. Like, can we try to keep this call for twenty or thirty minutes? Yeah. No problem, Dave. I'm curious. So, like, are you ready to just buy now? We can skip the whole call. And he literally said yes, and we have a contract out for signature right now. So, like, the best case scenario is that they're actually more ready than you initially thought, and you can get things wrapped up early. The more likely outcome is like, oh, no. We're not there yet. And then you can do discovery. Like, no problem. That was probably a a bit aggressive or a bit pushy, but, you know, that's the sales rep for me. I'm curious. What other boxes do we have to check that would get you to the point where you are ready to buy? So it just kinda opens the door for you to ask the questions, like, what is the gap? What do we actually have to to do to get you to a place where you're ready? Well, it's really interesting the way that you're approaching this because I think a lot of salespeople hear, oh, I've gotta guide the customer. I've gotta teach them how to buy, and they over rotate into their typical steps that somebody goes through. They don't ask the question, what do you need to see, hear, feel, and believe about Gong to say, yes. I am ready for this thing. Where else do you extend that soft close to? One of my favorite places to incorporate it is as you start to talk through a potential pilot. I know a lot of companies do, like, a pilot or a proof of concept as part of their sales cycle. What I typically do is I'll be like, hey, Nick. Before we start talking about a pilot, can I outline the two routes that people typically go when they buy Gong? They say yes. I'm like the first is people are really excited about Gong, but they want to validate the tech works, prove out ROI, that kind of thing, in which case we'll do a proof of concept. The challenge there in full transparency is that really handicaps my ability to discount because we're literally validating the fact that this is a worthwhile spend for you. The second route people go is they're already confident that Gong is the right solution, and they're ready to buy, which gives me a little bit more leverage on the price they end up paying because time is money, and we can get this done fast. Curious of the two buckets, like, you you feel yourself leaning into one. So once again, you're outlining the potential steps, and then you're essentially just asking to forego the pilot. And the amount of times I've actually been trending towards pilot, toward pilot, thinking I'm about to spend two weeks diving into a deep dive pilot, and they're actually ready to buy, it's been been pretty, pretty game changing. Talk to me about the dance that you play there, which is you're essentially preempting the fact that you'll have some flex on commercials if you don't do a pilot. Right? Do you worry that that preempts the discount conversation earlier than expected, or is it one of those things where you know a real mid market company is gonna ask anyway, so you'd rather use that to drive momentum earlier? So there there will probably be other things that I'll have to identify before going into that top track. Like, you know, is price gonna be a factor in this deal? There's there's other boxes I have to check. But in a k in the case where, like, I know commercials are gonna be really important. Like, for example, the the the last time I did this, throughout the whole sales cycle, they're like, yeah. We really like Gong. It just feels expensive. We really like Gong. This feels expensive. So I knew when I outlined that top track, this is gonna be really juicy to them because they've been concerned about the commercials the entire time. So I wouldn't necessarily proactively lead with that with a company that I've never talked about that with. Another version that could be the same thing, except instead of the carrot being a discount, the the carrot is like, hey. I could run a two week pilot with you where I do my best to get you all set up and put Gong. But I'm an AE, and that is not where my area of expertise is. Other option is you're ready to go. You know you want Gong. We can get you handed over the post sale team who's gonna do a better job of getting this fully implemented and up and running. So that doesn't necessarily have to take a discount care, but the the point is I'm outlining two routes with some kind of advantage for for moving fast. How do you navigate that discount conversation where they say, hey. You know what? We might be able to skip that pilot. Like, what do you mean you have you have more leverage? What does that look like for us? How do you respond to that? I'll do discovery around the rest of the buying process. I'm like, hey. Before we we do start talking about commercials, the last thing I wanna do is we align on some discount, and then we find out three other people have to be involved. We have to check off the security. So I'll do discovery around the paper process and make sure that the actual last thing standing between us and a partnership is commercials. And then I'll do discovery around, like, what is important to them instead of just proactively offering a discount. I'll be like, you know, here are here's our approved pricing. Here are the levers that I do have to pull. One of them is timing, so glad that we've checked that box. And then I'll ask questions, like, what's important to the you? What would entice you to move faster? That kinda stuff. So, JC, to wrap this one up, is part of the reason that you're even able to ask those questions or offer the carrot of price because you're soft closing at every moment in your sales cycle. And if they say, no. I'm not ready to buy right now, you're asking them what's important to them to continue their buying process. Right? But I'm curious for you. How do you suss out an objection that is one that you can solve through a demo, through a pilot, through future calls versus someone who says no, and you shouldn't meet with them again because they're a waste of your time? I think there's a few ways to pressure test deals. First of all, is if you don't feel any friction throughout the sales cycle, that's a really alarming thing. If you talk through list price and they don't have any objections, if they don't ask any questions about, you know, what a pilot can look all the same, like, that's alarming to me because I'm like, oh, you don't feel that invested in it. The second thing I'd look for is if you're talking to one person and they're not willing to take you to other people internally, that to me is a huge indication that that they'll deal might not be that real. Like, I need to see that people are willing to go out on a limb and bring in additional stakeholders to our conversation. That gives me confidence they're actually invested in it. And then the third thing is just you you know after selling for a decent amount of time, like, what's the real use case and what isn't. And you can just kinda start to feel people that, like, our tire kickers tell you what you wanna hear, and you just kinda end up developing a BS sensor for it. Like, if there's nothing they're looking to solve for, and they're just, like, happy to take another demo, that's that's pretty alarming to me. And I I think one thing that will also tell you if you are where you need to be in the deal is when you're uncovering business pain and priority, if they can't really speak to what their company's key initiatives are, what they're looking to solve, what metrics they're looking to influence, then you're probably not at the right person or you don't have a real deal. That's a phenomenal point. We gotta move to the final question. The final question is this, JC. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it's hurting them more than it helps? Yeah. The biggest thing is, like, you have to stop being scared of hearing the things you don't wanna hear. Instead, you have to proactively try to hear those things. Like, the for the longest time, I would just not even ask, are you evaluating anyone else in the space? Those kind of questions because, like, I didn't wanna hear it. I didn't wanna know. People have to get out of that habit. Like, you should be a heat seeking missile trying to find risk in every single deal as opposed to somebody who's got their head in the sound hand and is trying to avoid hearing the scary things. That's a mic drop moment. JC, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Your top four takeaways from this episode with JC Pollard include number one, the way JC opens his cold calls is after he gets the permission, he does not pitch what he does. He uses the three by three, which is I noticed this, this, and this about you. How familiar are you with what we do? Number two. Throughout the cold call and throughout your sales cycle, be outrageously authentic. A fun example that JC gave amongst many others was when he said, I would have been fired if I only closed deals where people had a million dollars of allocated budget to by Gong. Number three. Upfront, JC sets the expectation that there are three possible outcomes for the call. And then at the end of the call, he says, look. I think we're at a one, which means there's a strong business case for Gong, and then asks the prospect in a soft close to validate or invalidate that they're ready to buy. And then lastly, number four, you can also use a soft close to skip a pilot. In other words, you can say, hey. We can move this thing faster, and I'll have more flex on commercial terms, or you might be one of the people who needs a little bit more time, who needs to see this thing and play around with it before you get comfortable. Which bucket are you in? Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out? Well, you can actually help JC out because I've been watching him and following him for a while on LinkedIn. And after interviewing him on this episode, I'm like, man, that is someone who is working his ass off at honing his craft. And this is someone who is also sharing that stuff on this show and on LinkedIn. And so it would mean a lot to me if you went on LinkedIn, sent him a connection request, and let him know that you heard him on thirty minutes to presidents club. You'll get two things out of it. One, you'll show thank you to our guest, which if you learned anything from him on this episode, would be meaningful. But then two, you'll actually get to see a lot of best practices he shares on LinkedIn. So send a note to JC, and we'll catch you next week on the show.
