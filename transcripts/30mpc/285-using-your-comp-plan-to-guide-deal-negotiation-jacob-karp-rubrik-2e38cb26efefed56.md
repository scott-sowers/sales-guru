## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. I'm your host, Nick Sigelski, joined with my co host, Jen Allen Knuth. And today, we've got Jacob Karp who works in strategic enterprise sales over at Rubrik. And, folks, if you've ever wanted to know how to get the most cash for your squeeze out of your commission, comp plan. And if you've ever wanted to know how to sell to security, which is one of the toughest places to sell to, this is one I think you're gonna wanna listen to. Jen, why should people listen? I think I learned more from this episode than any other episode we've done together. Jacob gets into really, really nitty gritty things about do's and don'ts of selling the CISOs, using your comp plan to set the guide of what you need to accomplish as a salesperson, and shares some really creative outreach strategies I frankly have never considered before. So definitely tune in. And a three, a two, a one. Let's jump in. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Alright, Jacob. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Yeah. Let's get into it. So first off, for sellers, the comp plan is your road map. As you start a year or as you come into a new job, you should be reading that comp plan because it helps you understand what it is the company is asking you to do. For instance, are certain products more lucrative? Are certain deal structures more lucrative? Are there accelerators, decelerators? Understand this so you can understand how to spend your time. Beautiful. What's number two? Next up. As we know as sellers, time is your greatest resource. So the ability to prioritize your top accounts, stack rank the territory, use qualitative and quantitative data that informs which accounts are gonna be the best to spend your time in. For instance, let's say your company is super strong in financial services or insurance, and 20 of your 100 top accounts are financial services or insurance. You should be spending time in that industry and prioritizing that sector. Beautiful. Round us out. What's number three? And I think we would all agree, Nick and Jen, that you need to be able to stand out from the pack with your outreach. You need to be creative in the way you go about it, but you also have to bring a well articulated POV and hypothesis so that you're bringing something that's relevant to them, but also is engaging with them to get into a meeting. Some of the things that I used to love to do and still do today are lunch and learns. I wanna show up at your building slightly unannounced, maybe scheduled. I might bring a food truck. I wanna have that conversation where I get a little opportunity to tell you about my POV and hypothesis, but also we get to jam back and forth. I love it. So, Jacob, I recently got engaged, and I'm planning a wedding. And one thing that my fiance is very interested in is having a food truck at the wedding. And I'm sitting here thinking, how on earth am I gonna pay for that? Let's say that I just been handed a new comp plan, and I'm trying to figure out how to make some extra dough to afford some extra an in and out truck at the wedding. Oh, I like that. What are the things I should be looking for, and how should I be dissecting my comp plan to make sure that I can afford whatever I wanna buy? It's a great question, Nick. And I think a lot of sellers, we just think that a comp plan is not something that we have any impact on. We're not gonna be able to change it. We're gonna have to sign it at some point, but we should be spending the time to understand what the company is incentivizing us to do. Right? So So when you go through that comp plan, you should be understanding what product mix do they want us to go prioritize that we're selling. So if there are five products that I can sell, but one of them happens to be paid out at a larger stake, that tells me that the company is looking to push that product or that part of the platform. I should prioritize that in my deals. I also wanna understand what is the deal structure that gets me the most commission. Are three year deals incentivized? Is it a one year deal? Is it prepay? Is it annual pay? These are the little triggers that as we advance in our sales career, we start to pay attention to and actually understand how it is we should go structure our deals. And then lastly, I think this is one that most sellers will look at. When do I hit accelerators? At what percentage? Also, are there decelerators? If I kill it and I get to 300%, do I go back to making my base rate? I hope not, because that's the company telling me, like, hey, just go chill out when you hit 300%, Jacob. So let's say you read your comp plan that there is an incentive for selling a multiyear deal. What do you do with that information then? What looks different as a result of reading that in your comp plan? As a seller, that's always in your head. Right? So when I'm going into, like, early meetings or I'm thinking about, like, how I might address this prospect or this campaign, I'm thinking about all through the sales process, how am I going to be, like, structuring the conversations, preparing them to have a financial conversation that deals with three years early and often because we wanna socialize that. I'm not telling them that makes me more money. That would get me in trouble. They probably wouldn't like that. I always want them to be thinking, hey, guys. We do three year deals. If it comes up where they say, why do you do three year deals? I need to be ready to answer that question articulately, truthfully, but I'm always shaping their brain and their buyer mindset to think about a three year deal. Yeah. One of the things that I have learned is that your buyer doesn't care about you making more money. Your buyer cares about what's in it for them. And so what you might consider doing when you get that comp plan is looking at all the things that you want, how you want to structure your deals to make the most amount of money, and then figuring out how can you position a longer term deal or additional seats upfront in the buyer's best interest. I'm curious about deals that might be you started them. You got a new comp plan. Now you might wanna restructure it. Do you have any advice for folks who might wanna go back to the customer and say, hey. Actually, I think we might wanna change the terms? If you want my unbridled answer on that, I don't have advice there. I think at the end of the day, like, your reputation, your integrity as a seller is probably, hopefully, for most people, what matters more than anything, Nick. So for me to do an about face or a pivot, I have two options. Either don't do it at all, which is probably where I side, or especially if you built a strong champion and you're closely aligned, you may actually be able to go to them and say, hey. This thing changed. They're asking me, and this is a secret conversation with your champion. Right? They're asking me to change the way we structure this. It would behoove me, but I'm gonna look for a way for it to behoove you too. And if we can't find a mutual place in the middle, probably might just have to scrap it and say I'm making less, but I'm doing right by my customer. Sounds very transparent. Todd Capone would be pleased. I'm with you. I think one of the examples, Nick, on that question when I was selling Challenger, I remember we had a new product come out, and there was a huge kicker, Jacob, to your point, to sell that new product. But I was late stage already, and we'd already had a formal proposal. So one of the ways I did it was I looked at what is a likely failure reason for this and then tied it back. And then I took it on myself to say, when we were talking about this, there's something I missed. And as I was thinking about your implementation, I realized that there's this risk factor we didn't talk about. Would you be okay if we spend a few minutes talking about this? So it's, like, leading with the risk factor versus leading with the new product. Yeah. It's an important balance, and it's a great way to go about it. Because, again, you've gotta do what's right by them, but we're also trying to do what's right by us and the company in the middle. Cool. So at this point, I know all the things that I should be thinking about to maximize my comp plan. Let's move into now. One of the big things that you and I were talking about on the prep call was you're extremely intentional as it relates to how you carve up your territory. Talk to me about your general thinking around how you're carving up your territory. Yeah. Absolutely. And I think it's such a good lead in. Right? Because the company and the comp plan has told us, here's where you should go spend your time from a product mix perspective, NetLogo, all the stuff you mentioned. Now we, as sellers, it's our job to look across our territory and think to ourselves, how are we going to stack rank this? How are we going to prioritize certain accounts? One of the examples I gave is in a certain industry, if you're strong, you use that. But there's so many different data points that we can leverage. And I think whether you're at a startup or, like, an early stage company or a mature company, you can find these data points. So just some of the ones that I think about. If your company has any ICP data, ideal customer profile data, you should be using that hands down. Right? That should be the one of the first things you look at because it's an indicator of people with propensity to buy in a certain sector that look like other customers. I also wanna understand total addressable market in an account. So if I go spend all the time it's gonna take, especially in that new logo, the company's incentivizing that. Probably gonna take a significant amount of time. If I go do that, is there a run or a track to a larger deal somewhere else within that company? So one, is my time worth spending there? I love also past opportunities. I wanna see what accounts have we touched before. That's an indicator of whether I can go have a warm conversation. Evident use case is another one. For folks who may not have the deepest data set or they don't have the time to get super pinned in on how they're researching their accounts. It's what are the evident use cases that you can see or that you know applies to a certain sector of business. Past champions is another one. Mobilizers, which oftentimes is a past champion as well. And then one thing that people should always be thinking about, especially if they need to generate pipeline quickly, where can I get warm intro and referrals? So I take all of that. That was a lot. I take as much of that as I can find. I put it in a g sheet or Excel spreadsheet in columns, and I basically score out my accounts. And I'm looking for that top 25 to 33% of my accounts to really focus my time on. Just to give me a sense, how many accounts do you have in your territory? I actually just made a switch, Jen. Previously, for the past ten years, I have 15 to 40 accounts. I have the time to go figure out what are my top accounts, get super deep in them. I actually just made a transition at Rubrik. I'm now covering a region. I have nearly a thousand accounts. So what's exciting about this conversation today is everything I just told you, I am actively doing during my day to day situation, and I'm having to relearn how to think about a lot of these things because, like, I've got a lot more to cover. So what's the starkest difference? Because I think that's a really interesting thing. What are some things that you're changing that you didn't do before that you're you started to do now to still not lose the focus, but be able to get yourself answers without being like, it's December. I finally prioritize my accounts. That's a great call out. So in that 15 account scenario, like, you do not have an excuse to not know almost everything about all of those accounts to your point. When you have a thousand accounts, that's when you have to really get focused on what's that top 20%. We'll call it maybe it's less. Right? Maybe it's that top 10%. It's that top 100. I wanna know as much as I can about them while scaling that. The next 30%, so, like, 20 to 50%, I wanna know some things because I still wanna be able to do some pipeline outreach and leverage my ecosystem. That bottom 50% is somewhere I haven't played in a while. And that, for me, it's how do I use generalized relevancy? And that's a term I've been telling myself about lately. It's, like, that's my go back to the use cases. Right? I'm not gonna know everything about business 500 to a thousand, but I'm gonna know if you're in a certain sector, this particular use case hits on your risk as a company from a cybersecurity perspective. I can use that, automate a little bit, get some outreach out the door, and try to pique some interest. How are you managing the messaging that you're sending to those bottom 50 percentile accounts? I guess I'm curious about how much variance you have, not for the, like, the top stuff, but for those, I should reach out to them, but they're not my top focus accounts. So something about me is I am pretty against sequencing, me personally, but it comes from that 15 account mindset. So the variance is not huge. If I'm running sequences or something close to a sequence that might not even be fully automated, there's probably four to five top tracks. And it either applies to particular personas or particular challenges that the businesses have overall. Now, yes, I will use some automated tools to get that out the door. I'll leverage our SDR team. One thing I'm really big on too, how do I enable my ecosystem to go sell for me? How do I enable different people in the business, partners, channel partners, like friends who sell into similar circles? How do I go tell them the story at scale so they can go tell someone on those accounts? Hey. You should meet with Jacob and Rubrik. So how are you doing that, Jacob? Were you just texting Jen and being like, yo. I'm selling to CISOs. I think you talked to him sometimes. Here's a one pager on us. So I'm curious. How have you gotten other people in the ecosystem to sell or make intros on your behalf? I think a lot of people struggle with it, Nick. Obviously, if they work at Rubrik, they're incentivized to do the same thing as me. If they're one of our channel partners or someone who gets incentivized again through their comp plan, gets paid by helping me get a deal done, that's a pretty easy conversation. I think where it gets interesting and, like, you guys are very well known in your spaces generally. But, like, you build a reputation for yourself, right, as a good person who has integrity, transparency, who's building a business. You find other people like that, and then you're just trading information, doing, like, some horse trading from friendship, accountability, relationship, etcetera, you leverage that over time. So it doesn't always work out in a one for one, but over time, you end up paying people back. They pay you back for helping get into an account or have a conversation with someone. One of the things I was guilty of as an AE is I would set my top 20% of accounts in the beginning of the year, and I do, like, an a, b, c, d tiering. And then I would never revisit it. So how often are you revisiting it? What are some things that prompt you to revisit it? Talk to us about just ongoing territory prioritization across a year. Yeah. This is such a great thing to think about because I've been guilty of that before as well. As I go through that top 20%, when I learn things about them that preclude me from potentially having an opportunity there, like, hey. We just signed a three year agreement with your competitor. It's across all the platform. You have no shot talking to us or doing anything with this, goes to the bottom. And then it's that next account up scenario where you're always sliding and iterating. Jen, to your question, I look at that monthly, quarterly for sure. I have Google alerts on most of my top accounts, if not, like, the top 40%. So if I see something that creates a compelling event, boom. I go back to the spreadsheet. I'm inlaying that into the data, and I'm moving accounts up if that's applicable to them. And then, like I said, moving accounts down when I learn something like, we don't have a shop there. Jen, you said you did a, b, c, d. Jacob, I'm not sure how many letters or numbers you're doing. Do you have guidance for folks about how granular and tearing they should get? Something I've seen work well is actually going away from a's and ones and twos and going to what I would call hyperfocus. Hyperfocus is your top 20%. I know everything about them. I know that the CISO, his son plays soccer here. He probably would be really mad that I knew that because it's security, but I know everything about those people. The next set is what we would call focus. Right? So we know 50% of the things we need to know about them. We know enough to be dangerous. And then that bottom set is just waiting to be slotted in when I learn something in the top two hyperfocus or focus. Doesn't align. I gotta bring them out. Let's bring someone else up. So I've been really curious about prospecting into CISOs because I go on LinkedIn, and it seems like every couple weeks, I see an angry post from a CISO saying, I hate salespeople. Stop calling me. Stop emailing me. And then some cheeky salesperson will write in the comment, like, how should we get your attention? And they'll always respond and say, we'll reach out to you when we're ready. And I could see a lot of salespeople who sell to security saying, well, I guess I'm gonna wait for the inbound, but I know you can't do that. I'm curious, Jacob. For folks who are prospecting into security, into CISOs, what are some things that they need to know that might be different than prospecting into other personas? Actually, for anyone who's in security like me, those posts are fantastic learning opportunities. Like, I save those posts and go back to them because they are indicators of, like, how to get to these people. I think you need to go into it with the mindset that you're selling to a sensitive persona, and I don't mean that emotionally sensitive. I mean, like, these are people that are tasked with keeping their organizations, the data, people's identities safe. So you need to have that in your mind when you go try to talk to them where, like, you shouldn't be sharing too much. Maybe you're not actually referencing other customers because a lot of CSOs will say, hey. If you're gonna come to me and tell me about other customers that aren't publicly referenceable, you'd probably do that to me. So let's not do that. So it's thinking about things like that. I think that the other part of it, and this is an interesting story I'll share, there was a CSO who I prospected into for months and months and months. And I was worried I was gonna get put on the bad list, and I learned that that person was gonna be in an event. I went to the event. I approached that person, and I just said, hey. Listen. I've been reaching out to you. Hopefully, you've gotten my messages. Hopefully, they've resonated. And what was super fascinating is that that CSO actually said, oh, yeah. I've gotten your messages. They're pretty spot on. The timing is off. Like, we don't need to make a purchase. We're not considering this, but you're in my saved file, and it's rare to get into my saved file. And so that story is not a pat on my back. It's more just if you are doing things the right way, you're not being aggressive, you're not sharing sensitive details, and you're relevant to things they care about, your day will come, just Nick, to your point. It might be a year from now. You have to keep doing your job, but you need to do it, like, sensitively. You need to bring them something that matters to them. And then going back to something we talked about earlier, your reputation in your industry or community matters deeply because that CSO or that CIO or someone is probably back vetting you with somebody and asking like, hey. Do you know this Jacob Karp guy? Is he a jerk? Is he cool? Should I ever talk to him? And if you built that, you will eventually make your way to a meeting. Or being told, hey. We're not having a meeting, but that's a good answer as well. What are some places that are unconventional that you've seen CSOs gather or places where you've tried to go out and be an observer and just let me just understand what they talk about, what they think about, that kind of thing. Yeah. There there's a lot of them. I think what's nice is that a lot of CSOs are becoming more publicly available. They'll show up at certain conferences. They'll do keynotes. So I always try to show up at those, you know, sit in the audience, say hello at the end, not pitch them and just say, hey, appreciate what you said here. I think that stuff is kind of obvious, Jen. I've heard of some interesting scenarios where CSOs gather at a gym or they go piping together. And, no, you should not show up to those things unannounced because that's gonna get you on the bad list with CSOs. But if you do these things the right way and you let them know, hey. I learned about this. Can I show up? Can I bring a food truck to the end of your hike? Do something that gives them a little bit of value, but also is, like, super nonaggressive. I'm curious about your messaging in your outreach. Because if I think about the typical tech prospecting paradigm, it's like, okay. My prospecting email is, like, line of personalization to get your attention, call out a problem that I think you might be experiencing, give a one sentence on the solution, and then have a open ended open to learning more CTA. That's been the main type of prospecting message that I've seen people champion as a best practice. I'm curious if you feel that might be different in prospecting to the security persona. Definitely. So I I think one thing in the security space that I personally have eliminated is the personalization. I have found that people are over that situation. I think the CISOs generally are. I'm looking for relevance. Right? I'm gonna go find something that someone in the company publicly stated, whether that's a revenue growth goal, a business trajectory goal, a challenge that they're facing, risk mitigation, decreased cost. It might come from a quarterly report. It might come from an investor presentation. It might come from a keynote. I'm going to use that as my beacon. Your CEO or whomever said that you are on a growth trajectory of 30% by 2030. I know that in your industry, reputational revenue harm takes place when cyberattacks happen. Here is why. And I don't even really talk about what Rubrik does. I'm more like from a generalized perspective. We help people circumvent this. If this resonates with you, let me know, and we can chat. The CTA is just like, did this resonate with you? But the top of that is so value would be the wrong word, but it's relevant. Like, it's hitting them. And again, like, I probably, Nick, I end up in that inbox of talk to later, but I'm okay with that because when something bad happens to a company and they have to make a decision very quickly on a vendor, they go to that talk to later folder, and I'm ready to have that conversation. One more question for you. We're talking about email and what you're putting in that email. Cold calling, security, kosher, not? What's your take? It's probably not kosher. Like, they don't pick up. Let's put it that way. But here's the part of it that I use. I'm a voice mail lever. People will laugh at this, but the voice mail is part of the POV. So if I email you and I LinkedIn message you, you don't respond, I call you, I leave a voice mail. It's super short. They never call me back. But what it's really doing from a psychological perspective is I'm always trying to be the person that can solve this problem if and when it becomes super problematic and they have to call somebody. Alright. What about video? I haven't tried it in security. I think I'm scared, Jen. I think I'm also scared of ending up somewhere deep in the bowels of Reddit, which, by the way, is somewhere I go to do some account research sometimes because you'll learn some great things, but I think I'm terrified of that. Another interesting thing in in security, if you go to approach a CSO or a security person, if you have a link, a JPEG, an image, a video, it goes straight into never getting to them because a firewall catches it or a different security component never lets it get to those people. Because if they got that link and they clicked it and it was a phishing scam and their whole company went down, not only are they fired, but that company is in serious trouble. So you have to, like, think about how you deliver these things, which is another thing going back to, like, how do you address CSOs and CIOs? Are they gonna be scared off by the fact that I literally sent them a video or a link and they're never gonna click it anyway? Frequency of outreach. How frequently do you reach out to these folks? I try to be pretty sensitive with this. I've worked in orgs where I've seen this happen. I'm not trying to reach out with such frequency that it looks like we're just spamming the crap out of everyone. I don't use formal automated cadences. But when I build out a thought process of, like, how I'm gonna reach out to these people, I don't say to myself day three, day seven, day 11. And this is something interesting that has worked for me in my career. I gut check it. I have these to dos on my calendar or I have a waterfall of how I wanna reach out to accounts, but it might be completely random. Like, I might reach out to somebody, and I might not hit them again for seventeen days. And there was no reason for it to be seventeen days. It just was my organic thought process on how I wanna hit them again. And I could be wrong. But I think for people, there's a genuine nature of that where they're like, this isn't just some crap sequence that every three days is gonna send me an email, like, thoughts, agree, checking in kinda thing. I wanna go back to something you lightly referenced that I'm super curious about, which is you mentioned Reddit. Now Reddit, I would not have thought for what you sell into. So talk to us about how you use that to better craft your outreach. So I don't know the stat on this, but Reddit is quickly becoming one of the largest search engines because there's just so much sitting in it. So if you went in and you typed in, like, selling to CSOs, you could very well come across some threads that they'd mostly be, like, dark Internet stuff. But at the same time, like, there might be some value in there. I think you can learn about how people are approaching different security protocols. You can go deep into that. You can find things about companies that they don't publicly share. Again, the CSO might be like, don't bring this to me because I don't wanna know where you found it. But it informs part of my account research. Like, hey. They are having a problem protecting this segment of their data. That helps me if I get into the right conversation. Right? So are you mostly looking at what salespeople in Reddit are saying about selling to CISOs, or you're saying there's, like, CISO to CISO conversations happening on Reddit? What it's more of is actually, unfortunately, like, disgruntled employees sharing too much on Reddit. There's also, obviously, a lot of sales threads selling to CSO, selling you to different segments. But, like, if you hit the right search words, like, you'll find some things. One of the things that I'm picking up from you is you're not deeply personalizing or you're not referencing customers that are not publicly referenceable because the folks that you're selling to, their job is to protect their organization's information. And I have to imagine when you get on a first call with somebody, like that first discovery call, I bet some of these security folks are even more closed off, camera off, very one word answers. Is there anything that you do to get those folks to open up? It can be frustrating, but I also understand where it comes from. When I get onto a first call, the way that I approach this to try to get people talking is to come with information that publicly available, that I know that they know is out there. I'm trying to establish credibility. I'm not trying to establish rapport because I think there's a lot of time wasted in any industry on that. I don't need to talk to them about the weather. I don't know if they like sports. I don't know. What I'm trying to show them is I spent time to think about how I can help you. I identified some things that you guys have said publicly in the market, and I state that to them because I wanna make it known. Like, I didn't go find this on Reddit. So I bring that to light, and I have found that will help open up the conversation. There is still some hesitancy for sure. But, like, leading with that credibility shows that you're not just some guy or gal looking for a commission check. You're actually there to help them. Oh my gosh. Jacob, this has been phenomenal. But we're running out of time, and so we gotta move to the final question. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. What is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Yeah. I'm actually gonna give you two, and I'll make it quick. One, spending time in places that is not gonna net anything out. We talked at length about that. You cannot waste that time if you are on a quota and you have other things to do. And then two, being overly aggressive, not leading with value, and not coming from a perspective of trying to help your prospects, you will quickly be weeded out, especially if you're selling into the industries and sectors that I am. Killer. Jacob, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else.

Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode with Jacob Karp. Number one, if there is a really tough to break into account that you're trying to get traction with, if you see somebody at the account speaking at a conference or a trade show, go to their talk and sit in that talk. At the end, introduce yourself to the speaker, not to pitch your thing, but to comment on how great this thing was and make a point of connection with them. Number two. When you are prospecting into more sensitive industries, don't name drop not publicly referenceable customers because the customer that you're prospecting is gonna say, wait. Are you gonna tell the world that I'm using you? I'm a CISO. I don't want that. So be careful with who you name drop. Number three, if you're selling into a CISO, your goal is to get into the talk to folder. Meaning, when things happen that are bad in a CISO's world, it moves really fast. So you wanna be that place that they go to. You wanna be in that folder so that they know who to contact when something bad happens. And number four, think creatively with our outreach. We are not just limited to emails and phone calls and DMs. Jacob talked about the idea of if you know there's a group of CISOs coming together to do a hike, maybe offer to put a food truck at the end and just be present where they're coming together. Now, Mick, how can our listeners help us out today? Well, folks, if you've not yet subscribed to thirty minutes to presidents club, you might want this to pop into your inbox or into your podcast feed whenever a new episode drops, which is pretty frequently. It gives you something to listen to when you're driving your food truck up to the mountains to hand out burritos to the CISOs. But, seriously, if you haven't followed or subscribed to the show, I recommend you do it. It would help us out a lot. We'll see you next week on the show.
