## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my co cohost, Marc Casaglow. And today, a fourth episode, the first episode of 30 MPC all time. Joe Caprio is back on the leadership show. Marc, why should people listen? Listen. Well, first of all, it's Joey Capps. And when Joe Caprio gets on a podcast, you better listen. So first, that's the first thing. Here's what I took away is I think that Joe hypothesizes and maybe even has a strong opinion that a lot of advice that you get from investors to early stage founders about how to do and structure deals is totally wrong. And in this episode, he gives a really interesting approach on how to create very creative deals that get customers in the door without sacrificing that year two revenue. It was, like, step by step how to do it. I I kinda got blown away. I thought it was awesome. Let's do it. And a three, two, one. Tune in to Joey Capps. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move, ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Joe, welcome back to the show and your first time on the leadership show. We start every episode with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Okay. I'm pumped to be here. My three tips are to prioritize pipeline creation. I've worked with some amazing marketers in my career. But in spite of that, I've always made sure that pipeline drives my decision making, not quota, not forecast. I'm not living off quota coverage and living off pipe coverage. So make sure you have enough pipeline retraction or Google the bull's eye exercise for a shortcut. Follow all the LinkedIn thought leaders. We're all giving our secrets away for free online, and then you should be discerning about which, you know, tips you apply and how you apply them. But pipeline's your responsibility is is tip number one for sure. Boom. What's number two? Tip number two, use AI. I know this is funny to hear, but it is already in your sales stack. Outreach and SalesLoft, Chorus and Gong, HubSpot and Salesforce, they're already building in generative capabilities like draft my email, contextualize my notes. So get your sales team to lean into those things and be an early adopter team out of Lacard. The purpose built are like a year away at this point, but they already exist. So if you have an issue, like, filling in the CRM takes too much time, generating good emails takes too much time, refining our business case or our case studies for this particular deal, it takes account research takes too much time. Go find those founders that are building those apps. Find them on LinkedIn right now. They're all pitching Glasswing for VC money, and they're all telling me they wanna sell through a sales rep like product led. They wanna give you an individual a trial. So go try all these things and be really good at it, and then introduce the ones that work to your boss. So be an early adopter if you're an AE. And if you're a sales leader, get your salespeople to trial and test out all these new applications, and then mandate that folks are using chat, g p t, or, like, the AI enabled Google search, but mandate that your employees get good at this because it's a ways out before it's automatic and easy. But the efficiency gains are crazy and they're happening right now, so use AI. Don't be the grandpa sales leader that makes your team send emails one by one because there are still some teams like that today, and that's what's gonna happen with AI next. Joe, bring us home. What's number three? Alright. My third tip's never gonna change. It is multi thread the entire organization. Like, you probably know this as a sales leader, but I promise you the folks coming out of school, the earlier salespeople on your team, they don't get it. You know? They're afraid to go over someone's head. They're afraid to sell around the person that they've met with, but, like, they just met this person thirty minutes ago. And I'm telling you right now, I haven't taken a first call with the sales team in years. I deploy human shields to go do that early evaluation and report back to me. And most of the products that I'm involved with buying, I never actually meet the salesperson until later stage. So we know this to be the case, but our sales reps meet with somebody and then hope they bring in power and don't wanna offend them. So you really have to double down on this concept that that's not your champion until they prove themselves to be your champion. It's just another employee at that company that you don't really know that well yet, and you need to train your sales reps to interview that person, pull out the information, give them one week to actually act like a champion. If they don't, immediately drop a cross organization campaign with the new information that you Dope, man. Listen. Three actionable things. We're gonna dig into the first one right in here. Now listen. Pipeline cures all ills. We know this. Most founders didn't start their careers SDRs. They're demand gen people. Like, give me the number one way that you want a founder to build pipeline that you know, you've seen all this across all all these different companies, Joe. Like, what do you see and actually works for founders to do this? So, you know, this is this is really interesting for me because I work in a in a CVC fund. So all of the deals that we're in were first money in the door. We do pre seed. We do seed investment. We're talking about, like, five person teams, and it's all built on AI or ML. So we invest in enterprise grade software built on it built on AI or ML. These founding teams are, like, really technical. I'm talking, like, Harvard educated, MIT grads, like, venture backed and and launching AI built applications for data infrastructure, cybersecurity. So they're literal geniuses, but they've never done cold campaigns before. So my my coaching, my strategy, it's, like, really down to basics. And I give two key pieces of advice to every founder. The first one is it doesn't actually matter how good your product is when you're looking for your 0 to $1.00 to $2,000,000 journey. It matters how much pipeline you have. And the best product doesn't always win in the early stage. It's the it's the founder that secures the right angel investors, the right thought leader advisors, the right, you know, VCs that actually do demand gen and and and meeting setting for them. And even with a bad conversion rate, you can limp into a into a series a versus focusing exclusively on your technology, which does matter. But then just assuming, you know, like, if I build it, they're gonna find out about it and show up. You need hardcore demand gen. And the other, like, you know, really important lesson that I focus on with founders is they look what salespeople do. And now that they're selling for the first time in their career, they emulate what they think salespeople do. So they write really verbose emails and they and they they they write in the style of a mature enterprise company, but that's not who they are. So it's almost like they're removing what's interesting about themselves to look like a salesperson. And so you take somebody who's HBS grad, raised venture money, has an article about them in Forbes, and they don't lead with that. They instead lead with dear sir or madam, we're helping companies like you achieve ROI. And the audience doesn't realize they're getting a cold email from an actual founder. It reads like they're getting an email from a BDR. So a lot of times with founders, what I have to get them to do is, like, slow down and stop acting like they're doing sales and instead leverage what's interesting and exciting about them and and go build, like, an earnest, genuine relationship with the would be users and markets that they wanna serve. And and kinda like, you know, go ask for a customer. You're gonna get some advice, but go ask for some advice, and you might surprise yourself and find some customers in there. So lead with what's interesting about you and prioritize demand gen really aggressively are the two things that I work with our early stage founders on in in terms of making sure they don't squander their seat. Yeah, Joe. It's it's really funny. To the point around the best product doesn't always win, very rarely is a startup started with zero competitors. There's almost always something that's at least a little bit close, and that product, by definition, is almost always farther ahead. I wanna go back to this first founder led outbound campaign. I'm curious if you're advising a founder who doesn't even have their first customers. What is the main way to get those first customers? Is it a cab campaign, a customer advisory board campaign? Is it cold email? Should they be investing in content and wait for the leads to come to them? How do you think about the first couple customers outbound? Dang, Arbonne. I I thought I was just gonna give some story like that one, and you would say I'm dropping real knowledge, but you're really gonna push me to be specific. So I'm I'm gonna tell you really specifically. What works right now for founders is LinkedIn over email, hard stop. You know, it's a 100% open rate. You do a connection request to somebody. You add a note to it. The note in the connection request, they're gonna read it even if they don't accept. 35% of people accept all LinkedIn connects no matter what, so that gives you an opportunity to continue messaging them. So build really smart target audiences on Sales Navigator and then action, like, a 100 connection requests a week with a very specific segmented message. Abandon email with 1% reply rates, abandon SEO, abandon things that take a long time to come back to you, and just build really smart theoretical market segments that you're gonna beachhead into. And so I've got a company in my portfolio right now that is gone fundraising and they wanted to do like a practice pitch to us. You know, we led their pre seed, and we're gonna lead their seed, and we're gonna help them raise their like, fill out the rest of the round. So they're practicing the pitch on us. And the founder says, you know, we're having success with manufacturing as as a beachhead, but, like, specifically, manufacturing that's ramping up seasonal employee count. So maybe going into the summer, they wanna they wanna produce more product. Or maybe going into the winter, they have to you know? So they hire a bunch of factory workers. Those people need to be trained and monitored. That's what our product helps with. Okay. Cool. Good to know. I open up ChatGPT and I I just ask, hey, what are the seasonal manufacturing in North America? And it's like toy manufacturing, chocolate, you know, and it's like, and it's telling you when and why they're seasonal. And I'm like, okay, who in a factory cares about efficiency and, you know, production per employee? What, what are the, what are the main drivers for, for align manager, in fact? And they're like quality control engineer, process engineer, like and there are all these roles you never heard of. So I said, great. I've got 10 industries, 20 companies per industry. I've got four roles per company. Like, move that over into Sales Nav, and it's literally 1,500 humans now. On one sentence, we're having success with seasonal factories. So you can literally just kinda take a hunch and build out thirteen weeks worth of outbound and then drive real net new meetings based off this theory you have. And the conversation's not, you need to buy my product. No. The conversation's like, here are my credentials. Here's what I'm building. Here's my funding. Here's why I'm legitimate. And here's why I wanna devote all of this education and money and desire into your role and your day to day problem. And I'm looking for friends. Damn. That's a hell of a lot better of a sales meeting to take than some sales rep trying to hammer you in in in buy the product. Well, you just laid out. This is what I'm thinking if I'm a founder is that's gonna take me a few hours to figure out my ICP, a few hours to get it loaded in a little sync sales map. I'm gonna constantly have to find stuff. All these messages are gonna take time to write, like, twenty hours a week towards building my pipeline, and I'm not running the company. So, Joe, tell me how to blow that mindset up if you're a founder. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Spend no time on it. Drive no pipeline. Have no customers. Your company before you're ready to series any. Two choices here, people. Do all meetings or let your company die on the vine. Like, you don't have a freaking choice. So now it's a matter of, like, how can I spot the most time consuming pieces of of this and then outsource, automate, whatever those pieces? And so a lot of times, what I do is I have a full time BDR that works for me here at Glasswing Ventures, and I deploy her into our our companies. And so she's supporting, like, six of our companies right now doing outbound for the founders there. I then, you know, I use that to kind of teach and wean the founder off of my BDR. And we either hire from Oceans, Prep for Prep, the mom project, like these really, like, mission driven female employee workforces or, like, underprivileged community workforces. And we tap them and we hire interns, EAs, entry level employees to support a founder. So I've got one company called Oceans, which will refer Sri Lankan employees, full time employees. It's like $35 for a full time employee. Just like half the price of a BDR, but they're doing full time work. And it's like, you know, English speaking, like tech enabled. Or for prep hires kids from the inner city, there's, like, as they're in college, but, like, they're testing really well. So they've got, like, a, you know, underprivileged neighborhood workforce of kids that are gonna graduate and command $102,100,000 dollar a year jobs in six months, but they're still a college senior, so you can work with them. Right? Or just use automation. Like, you know, I use Phantom Buster on LinkedIn. I use ChatGPT like I mentioned. And, you know, so some combo of of, like, robots and entry level, you know, second nation employee employee forces. And, you know, I didn't spend much launching Reprise. I'll tell you that much. $800 to sales navigator in, like, you know, twenty hours a week to a college intern, and and we were at a million in revenue. So you could do this. Mark, I'm curious. You had the opportunity to sell from the very, very, very early days. And my guess is when you were early at Outreach closing their first deals, it wasn't just Mark versus the universe reporting back what was happening in the market to a CEO. So did you have a similar motion to what Joe is describing as it pertains to how you sold with a CEO? Was it different and your CEO didn't wanna be involved at all? How did you balance that first sales hire and CEO relationship in the early days? So listen. I sat from in the very beginning, from about 04:30 to 07:30PM eastern every day well, four days a week at my kids' gymnastics practice in the parking lot, pirating Wi Fi, and doing Zoom calls to close the first couple $100,000 outreach stuff. So that was me doing that. Manny was doing a lot of the messaging and talking and evangelizing and fundraising and all that in separate non sales conversations. And when we would kinda swap notes on what was working and what wasn't working and and how were you doing it. I will say, though, that here's something that I think elevated us as sellers and set the sales culture the right way at Outreach, which was we had a game meeting I play called laptop closed. And laptop closed meant how long can you keep your laptop closed in a meeting before you have to show the product to get a signature? We would just hold out on showing the product as long as we could. Just have the real conversation about pain and how we solve it and explain what Outreach was. And both of us got pretty damn good about closing deals without even ever showing the product. Then we brought the the team in. We started saying, listen. Laptop closed. Like, if you gotta show the product to sell it, then you're not selling it. And then we can just figure out somebody that can show the product and collect dollars. That's not what we need to do here. So that was a huge thing that we did. But I would say, like, I remember we did our first $25,000 deal at Outreach, and it was just so happened to be at our first, like, little off-site. There's three or four reps there. This is a deal I've been working for a long time before we hired anybody. Manny's on it. We're doing the call, the closing call in front of the team and most of the rest of the company just to get everybody pumped about this huge first deal. And Manny says, and we'll give you every user for free for $25,000 forever. I was like, oh, and that's when we kind of formally moved Manny to the CEO role and out of founder led sales. Mark, when I joined Chorus, right, I don't wanna get out of school here, but when I joined Chorus, man, they had famous logos. Like, I couldn't believe it when they started saying we had 70 customers at the time, but they were like juicy customers and the revenue was under 1,000,000 total. And I was like, these things don't foot. Right? These things don't make sense. And I looked in there and they had ELA, Elastic Site Enterprise license, right, like, across the every every user for free, $5,000 for the year. And, you know, I joined the company a month. We were, like, on a couple of them, three months away from renewal. And I drew that short straw where I had to call someone, introduce myself. I'm the new sales leader at Chorus, and I don't wanna be I wanted to meet you before your renewal. Your pride you know, everything's great. You know, we love you as a customer. You're gonna go from $5,000 to a $125,000, but the good news is that represents a 30% discount off our list. No. Hey. And I think this actually gets us to a good point talking about founder led sales. Like, Joe, what are you telling people around like, alright. Like, I think those first founding customers in here, I'm gonna have to give them some commercial leeway because we're buying something that's unknown versus what do you transition to? Like, hey. We have a pricing sheet. We gotta stay somewhat close to it. Like, how how do you help people navigate that part of it? Probably not before you have product market fit. You know? So probably not before the series a and probably a lot later than you think you have to do it and a lot later than your other investors and advisors are telling you that you have to do it. Sometimes, Mark, I'm like the anti VC because, you know, I'm just twenty years in sales leadership, and now I'm a I'm a sales adviser employed by a VC phone, but that doesn't make me one of these, like, term sheet looking at people. You know? I'm still just about getting to the outcome that you need to get to. So here's here's what I did at Reprise. Well, I'll start what I did at Chorus. I just leaned into it. I said, okay, these like flat rate deals get people to sign there. There's still skepticism. It's an emerging category. It's a known category yet. So I'll do these wonky year one deals and I'll open it up and I'll say you could use it company wide flat rate. Whatever you sign on for in year one, you can use it company wide. But six months into the first year, we review your usage. And nine months into the first year, we sign year two's deal. And what ended up happening there is I got people to try it in different departments and try it for different use cases than they would have if I really clung to the the core pricing model. And so I was able to, like, do a loss leader like Turkey around Thanksgiving, you know, and sell all the sides. So I was letting people kinda have unfair agreements in year one. We had fresh funding, like, flush with cash, and then I was triple and four x ing, you know, contract values in year two. So then when I launched Reprise, I was just honest with people. I don't know how this category is gonna price. Is it per seller? Is it per, you know, demo we create, like, per unit, per usage, per employee? Like, how are we gonna price it? So I'll tell you what. I know my price point's 50 k. I was launching 50 k, and I did my first six deals at 50 k a piece. And so I'd say 50 k flat rate. I don't care what happens in the product that's flat. And then halfway through this agreement, we're gonna figure out our pricing model, and I'll come back to you and we'll negotiate year two. And that actually worked really well too because people taking flyers on, like, you know, it's not a proven product yet, but they're, like, taking it. It it's almost like a paid experiment in year one. They wanna know their exposure is capped. So flat rate is sexy to a buyer of a 0 to $2,000,000 product. Like flat rate is sexy to someone testing a new idea out, and that encourages them to open it up to new users and get new eyes on it. And it almost like presets the renegotiation for a year too. So remove the fear from getting the deal done, enable massive viral expansion of of use, and then pre secure, an like an eye to eye genuine renegotiation. Renegotiation. You're kinda kicking the can down the road and you're not, like, setting your price in year one. But, you know, you'll get more deals done and they'll grow faster. And, ultimately, I think it's more revenue. So lean into, quote, bad deals, especially as a founder. You know? For you, I could do this. Right? And and get some, like, weird favors in exchange. Like, they speak on a webinar. They they give you a case study, stuff like that. So wheel and deal as a founder. Wheel and deal. Right? Right right till the time the board tells you they're gonna remove you if you keep wheeling and dealing. Well, I think there are two pieces of this that you guys have both pointed out. And it all comes down to when you're doing founder led sales, you don't want to lock in before you actually understand where this product and this business is going. So when you talk about the laptop close game, right, the reason you don't show demo early on is oftentimes at Pave, they would be talking at a about a problem that we wanted to solve in three months. We're like, oh, shoot. That's where our product needs to go. And that was actually actually the juicy problem that we need to pull us in a product market fit. And so we were huge fans of the no software sale because the product that we had today, the moment we were in demo, there were only so many things we could show them. There were only so many problems we could solve. But without the demo, we could solve any problem in the freaking world, and we certainly did, and it drove our engineers crazy. But that pulled us into product market fit. And then to your point, Joe, I think of the first 100 deals that we sold, maybe five had any sort of rate card that mapped out future year pricing, and it was like a it was a very juicy renewal cap at most. And the reason is year one, I'm gonna give you the sweetest deal in the world. Right? The sweetest deal in the world. And year two, I'm gonna keep you with the product, not with the the contract. So if you're overcomplicating these three year, four year, five year deals, I see these, like, early stage sales teams trying to sign these, like, four year deals. You don't even know if this product is gonna exist anymore, guys. What are you doing? Yeah. Armando, I used to keep a, a Slack channel open to your point about about not really knowing what product market fit is in in early stages. I'd get on a call with somebody, and I'd say, hey. Like, we've raised some money. We're we're exiting stealth mode this winter. Right now, I'm just kinda getting feedback from your job title. So let me kinda, like, talk you through what we're building here, riff with you, and I I wanna know, like, is your industry a good industry to be chat? Is your role the right user? Like, am I explaining this problem right? Help me out. Give me a pre half hour. And that's the context of a lot of my early sales pitches when I launch a company. So I get on the call and not do you wanna buy this, but can you help me identify if I'm building this for you or or someone else? It's a it's a much more interesting conversation to have. People like that. And in that conversation, they say, you know, Joe, like, I don't need your product here now, but you should have called me at my last call because insert scenario, insert dynamic, insert whatever. At that industry, at that company, at that in my last job, we had this problem you should have called. And so I'm taking all these meetings not to close every deal I talk to, but to walk away and go, seasonal manufacturing, you know, or whatever, like, the new might be. And then I get to work, and I go generate 50 meetings in that cohort. And I go, you know, Armand, I was talking to the role at company two weeks ago, and they said something interesting. And that's why I reached out to you. Can I validate that at your industry, your segment, your you know what I mean? That exist. And now, again, I'm actually going for a close here. I'm doing an actual sale where I'm like, I believe this you have this issue. If so, can we you know, like, I'm really going with, like, customer testimonial led, like, second generation prospecting. You look like a deal of mine. But it's more like, you look like a deal this prospect described. And, again, I'm a founder. I'm venture backed. I'm about to launch. I just want a friendly chat. Should I launch with you? And so, again, even though now I'm going for deals, I'm still doing that friendly, affable, I'm a venture backed founder. Isn't that interesting? And the audience is saying, yeah. It is interesting. And, yeah, I'll give you an honest ear and listen to what you're saying and then tell you, yeah, my business is like that. I do have that challenge. That last person you talk to is right, and maybe I should be in your mid funnel. And they'll invite themselves into evaluation if you do it that way. So that's that's me on early stage sales is intentionally lose deals to learn the deals you could win, and then go tell them that story. Hey, you're Peter from another company, said you should buy my product. That's interesting. The conversations are the value, though. Right, Joe? Like, that that's the thing. It's early stage, the conversations are the value. The wins will follow good conversations. Yeah. 100%. Especially if you're willing to have enough of those conversation. But, again, that goes back to to, like I mean, you guys called it out, and I know you're kinda devil's advocating the question of, like, how much time do I have to do demand gen? I'm gonna build a real business. And it's like, I don't care if you manually send emails or pay someone to do it. You know, I don't care if you actually write, like, deep thoughtful content where you use chatty PT. Just like, I don't care how you get this done. But the reality is, like, you're gonna need a couple of 100 conversations, like a couple of 100 actual logos to show up on a Zoom meeting with you for you to generate 20 customers. You know what I mean? Like, if you think you're gonna convert more than 10% when industry like, best practice win rates in this business are, like, 25%, and that's what the company that has a fully mature product and understanding of their target market and great collateral to support a well trained sales team, and they're converting 25% of deals. So if you're gonna come out here with an MVP with no SOC two, like, no reputation, no demand gen, nothing, and think you're gonna convert more than, like, five or 10% of your conversations, you're nuts. So how will you have 300 meetings in the next eighteen months? Right? Like, that's the only question you have to ask yourself, not will I do it, but, like, how will I do it? Otherwise, you're gonna you're gonna pay. I know how. How? You use AI, which gets us to your second point, Joe. Alright. So listen. I just did a post yesterday. It has almost a thousand likes now, well over a couple 100,000 impressions, and where I talk about some new AI tools that I've heard that are just, like, I think, really gonna make a big impact on the sales function. So what are a couple tools? What are a couple workflows? Like, you're a young founder. What would you kinda do to get started with some AI stuff? Because you say you gotta jump in the AI pool. Don't, like, dip your toe in. Like, go ahead and jump in. Right? Yeah. I've got so I'm actually building out, like, a a small presentation for the founders in our portfolio. It's it's in the November. You know, we're gonna bring them down to a, to, like, a venue in Southern New Hampshire and and give them this presentation about, like, what what AI exists in a sales stack right now, and then, you know, have a nice, like, meal together. It's just one of the things you do as a VC fund for the founders portfolio. And the presentation I'm gonna give him breaks down Gen AI in a sales stack into four categories, you know, demand gen, AE work or mid funnel work, expansion, and then insights and reporting. And because we're a seed fund, we're less focused on expansion monitoring, you know, because we're looking for that first 2,000,000 in revenue, most of our cost most of our companies. But we're also less focused on, like, advanced insight and analytics, like a company like a modern InsightSquared. Right? Like a like a Gen AI enabled InsightSquared or or a Gen AI enabled, you know, expansion monitoring tool. So we're we're less focused on that with this presentation. We're more focused on demand gen and AE mid funnel work. And for me, I think that the demand gen category, what's most interesting is an ability to build a real account list, not living off a legacy, like, filters and fields. You know? It's like we grew off. We graduated off SIC codes two decades ago, and we've never really replaced it. Like, I want I want this type of business with this nuance and and and these details. You can't do that filtering sales nav or or buying a list off off your list providers right now. So, like, doing really, really smart account list building is interesting to me. And then getting beyond that to, like, who and how can I get that meetings? There's a lot of entrance right now on on, like, who and how should I prospect. Not like not Lavender Reggie writing email, but, like, you know, finding the human being, finding a trigger, and then suggesting, like, don't email that person. Have your boss email that person. Right? It's like that's an interesting one for me. I'm less geeked out about, like, drafting good email because you could do it on chat g p t. You could do it in SalesLoft Outreach, Gong. Like, everyone is drafting email, so I don't care about that. So demand gen for me, it's finding good accounts, finding good humans and triggers. On the AE stuff, you know, Gartner and McKinsey are saying that, like, 50% of of buyers are gonna engage with digital deal rooms within the next two years, and that's all buyers. So never mind buyers of, like, high-tech. So your SaaS buyer is gonna be conditioned within the next two years to see a, you know, doc send room where you can engage. And in there is gonna be a recording of your meeting and, you know, a case study and the pitch deck and the ROI model, and all of your written collateral is gonna be consumed asynchronously. And so for me, I think value engineering is an incredibly interesting category where you can take your existing sales collateral. So you learn the tone of your of your value prop. And then you can look deal by deal, read the transcripts, read the emails, like, look at Google News alert about the prospect you're selling to, and then look at the stage they're in in the CRM and tailor the stage appropriate sales collateral and deliver it to the prospect. Oh, man. Right? So I I I look at that as somebody who's always lamented getting reps to do what he says. This is beautiful. Take transcripts and emails and fill in the CRM and and properly forecast and then alert teammates to, like, sales needs. Like, this team needs discounting training, or this deal needs a sales engineer, or this product needs feature. But, like, everything we were supposed to do, go be the frontline, talk to the customer, put it in the CRM, and and and bring it to the business. We don't do that as salespeople. And with GenAI, it's gonna happen. So all of that, like, mid funnel collaborative closing deal stuff, anything you could do with Google News transcripts and and email exchanges to help the business and the rep win deals and and and win more deals. Oh, man. Am I excited about that stuff? So I'm I'm in, like, a really interesting, like, you know, buffet of really, really interesting sales tech with this explosion of of GenAI. It's like, it's a crazy time to work at a at a in an AI focused c VC fund. Like, it's very, very enjoyable right now. Unbelievable. Well, Joe, around four, unfortunately, even though it is your fourth round on thirty minutes to president's club, it is not forty minutes to president's club, so we have to call it a show with our final question. And the final question is, Joe, what is one thing that a sales leader or maybe in this case, a founder running a mini sales team, what is one bad habit that a sales leader should break, stop doing immediately that would make every revenue organization in the world a little bit better. Stop sending campaigns before you manually clean your list. Do not send dear sir. Do not send Joe rocket ship. Do not send emails to salespeople that work for your competitor because you didn't take the time to just purge the list. Look at the first 20 people on the list. And if you're not 18 out of 20 or a match, you have more filtering to do to get your list right. Stop sending embarrassing emails. This is a rant to myself, by the way, Armand. I've enjoyed the public rant, the rant to yourself, and everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.

I think, you know, Joe has a unique perspective as a early employee at InsightSquared, as an early sales leader at Chorus, as one of the founders of Reprise. I think that he has a unique perspective on how to get a company started and get that early momentum so that you can get the funding you need to find your real footing and get going. And I think he talks a lot about that in this episode. Yeah. I think the most important concept is whether it was the early outbound campaigns or the ways that he's advising founders to do discovery calls, your goal is to test a list of accounts, certain personas on those accounts, and certain triggers or problems. He talked about manufacturing seasonality, these titles, and these times of year, these problems. And if it doesn't work, that's okay. Cross it off the list and move to the next one. Use your outbound and use your discovery calls as a mechanism to cross ICP candidates off the list and figure out what works and then triple down on that. But the only way you can do that is by having 300 conversations. Conversations are the key at this stage, and I think that he kinda walks us through ways to create those conversations that help you understand what do I need to do differently? Who do I need to approach that I haven't approached? What use case it's actually what I'm trying to solve, not what I first came in with that opinion on. And so I think that Joey Capps does a really awesome job of kinda walking us through that. But, you know, I think that what really stuck out to me is the fact that he's like, listen. You can do a lot of stuff as a founder. But if you don't have conversations to get customers in the door, everything else does not matter. And that's where you gotta start as a founder. You gotta figure out how to find the time to get these conversations booked and then to have them and learn from them. Because you can go off building a product. The perfect product dies without customers and conversations. That's right, folks. And this is a pretty timely one. So the last thing that we will leave as an ask to the audience is I forget if it's gonna come after or before the publish of this episode. But if after it, there's a founder series webinar that we're actually running on the path from 0 to $10,000,000 of ARR. It's actually with me and the Pave CEO and the first two sales hires, Killian and Morgan. So I'll go check that out. If it's already after that date, the show note for the on demand will contain the on demand link, but it may actually be coming in a week or so. So you may be able to tune in for that as well. Alrighty, folks. We will catch you soon on the next episode of 30 MDC.
