## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. If you've ever listened to 30 MPC before, you may have been fortunate enough to hear one of the hall of fame episodes from one of the greatest guests we've had, Charles Mulbauer. If you don't know his stuff, if you've ever struggled with asking discovery questions or asking for power in a way that doesn't feel cringey, he is the master of asking questions in a way that doesn't piss off your prospects, and this was a clinic. Three, two, one. Let's roll. Charles, you are the master of asking questions that sellers need to know the answers to that prospects do not wanna answer. Who's gonna approve this thing? Do you have budget? How is that actually gonna impact your business? What's procurement gonna try to take out of the piece of the pie? Early in the sales cycle, people will say, can you just show me your product, or can you just tell me how much this thing costs? When that's happening early on in a discovery call, how do I get a prospect to work with the process? Whenever I'm about to go into discovery, I want the prospect to be prepared that I'm going to ask a number of questions. It never hurts to ask for permission while providing a reason that benefits the prospect. That might sound like, hey, Armand. Would it be okay if I maybe asked you two or three very direct questions? This way I can pinpoint our demonstration to what's most important to you and the team versus things that are generic and are not a good use of your time. I find that prospects don't push back on things that make logical sense because they don't want to waste their time. That is something that also solves for a nugget, which is prospects crave reasons for things. They love them. When you give them a logical reason, they like it, they value it, and they're more likely to say yes. So aside from asking for permission to ask direct discovery questions, I'll also ask for permission around next steps. That might sound like, so, Nick, would it be okay if I make a recommendation on what I've seen the best next steps usually are for other prospective clients? It's another way to ask for permission. You can just ask simply, hey, Nick. Can I make a recommendation? Would it be okay if I made a recommendation around next steps? These are things also that prospects are not used to. Very refreshing. I know one of the areas that causes a lot of people to feel very uncomfortable is when a prospect asks them about pricing very early in the deal cycle. What's your recommendation for how people respond when a prospect is pushing them for pricing information before the salesperson feels like they've properly established value? It's not that we hold price until we establish value. It's we explain price is dependent on a variety of criteria. So they're not two different things. If I was talking to a prospect and the prospect said, just tell me the price, I'd say, sure. As you can imagine, the price is based on a variety of criteria. We have clients that pay us $10,000. We have clients that pay us a $100,000. We have clients that pay us a million dollars. I don't expect you to be in that very large range at this point in this conversation, but it is dependent on a variety of criteria. I had a number of questions for you just so that we can at least get the right footing around what range you could be in before we decide to move forward. Would you be okay with that? So it's honest. That that's what it is. That's a reasonable question, and I'm gonna answer it because it deserves an answer. What should you do if a prospect asks you a question that you think is irrelevant? I would first acknowledge the question, say I appreciate the question. And then I ask for permission to reframe the conversation. So that might sound something like, yeah, Nick. That's a I appreciate the question. Can I give you some context around how our current clients think about our offering? Because it's a little different than how you're approaching it. Would that be okay? So now I get to reframe the conversation. Because, typically, if prospects are asking me a question that's irrelevant, it usually means they're misunderstanding what's happening or they're misunderstanding the offering. There's a disconnect. So, Charles, let's pretend that the next step in your sales cycle is a meeting with power. What's the right way to ask for power in a non inflammatory way? I might say, so, Nick, just to give you some context, if we might work together, it sounds like the price range would be anywhere between a 100 and $150,000. In my experience, I found that those who were ultimately in charge of making this decision, it sounds like it's Sarah on your end if I heard that correctly. I found that when I've given them an opportunity to just roast me and ask me any direct question that they wanna ask me without me doing any pitching or anything like that. I find that they feel it's really valuable. This way, they can dot their eyes, cross their t's, and avoid any misunderstandings or misconceptions about what this is versus what what it's not. Do you think Sarah would like the opportunity to do that as well, or do you think that's a terrible idea? If you ever read question based selling, he calls it a neutral disposition. So doing a neutral disposition allows a more accurate response from a prospect. It's not, hey, Arman. You wanna hang out tomorrow? Let's say Arman's like, I don't really wanna hang out with Charles. He's like a loser. You know? But I might say, hey, Arman. You wanna hang out tomorrow, or is tomorrow a bad time for you? Right? The other tricky one is you might get a problem that sounds like a process problem or a surface levels problem. Like, we're spending a lot of time in spreadsheets. And the problem is that you and I both know that one person spending a lot of time on a task does not justify a 6 figure purchase. And so you need to turn that small problem into business impact. But the problem is most sellers, they'll ask cringey questions like, what would you do with all that time back in your calendar? Or how do you think you would quantify the impact of this time on the business? And all of those things are super, super cringy leading sales questions. And so how do you get them to quantify the impact of process problems without sounding very salesy? The problem with impact questions is people, like, jump for joy over impact questions. Impact questions should be the grand slam home run question. And you don't have grand slam home run questions without really getting, amazingly solid sense of what the problem is, why it's a problem when they realize it's a if it's a problem, as well as, like, why do they care really that much. Like, unless all of that stuff is not there, I shame on me for asking an impact question. I avoid asking impact questions as much as I possibly can unless I've delved into the problem. When you say you're spending too much time, can you help me understand can you maybe give me a specific example that comes to mind where that where that showed up? Right? I can use a disclaimer. I know this might sound like a weird weird question, but why is that a problem for you? Like, because I talk to a lot of prospective clients where that's a problem, but they don't really care to software. I'm just curious how you're thinking about it. Right? And they say it's a problem because they'll and they'll go into especially if the report is there, they'll tell you the impact. And then when they tell you the impact, you'd be like, oh, okay. Out of curiosity, I appreciate you sharing this, Susan. You know? I speak to a number of my clients on a daily basis. They they've told me that sometimes when they waste time on x, y, and z, it's impacted these other areas as well. Is that something that you've experienced, or am I or am I way off there? Right? Just you wanna test that, gauge it. And then to your point, Arman, maybe it's just them. So I'm gonna ask them, to to what extent have you and the team discussed this internally as a problem that needs to be solved for, or would you say it's only been you thus far? Right. There are many different ways to ask that question. I'm always going to ask a widely known type question. Because if they haven't discussed it, then that's going to tell me where I should be spending my time or if I should be spending a lot of my time with this person. Or I might quite frankly say, hey, Arman. I always prefer to be more accurate than optimistic. The last thing I'd wanna do is talk about solving a problem that only you care about, and then you go back to your team and they say, you know what, Bob? We actually do not care at all. And that's something that I've that I've seen before. Do you think it might make sense to talk about it internally and determine whether or not you wanna talk more? It's another asking for permission, providing context. Right? They're all mixed into one question while expressing your concern using I'd rather be more accurate than optimistic, all that stuff, and that helps more artistic or more artful question.
