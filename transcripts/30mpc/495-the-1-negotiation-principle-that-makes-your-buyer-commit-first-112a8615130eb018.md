## Transcript

The give get paradigm is the fundamental principle that governs every single negotiation in sales, and it's very simple. Anytime you are giving your prospect something, you're gonna get something in return. So if you give them a discount, you need to get their commitment that they're gonna close by the end of month. You need to get timeline in return. And the problem is most sellers literally execute it in that order. They give a discount, and then they try to get timeline in return. And so the prospect's like, oh, I'll take that 20% discount. And they're like, great. I'm anchored there. And then the salesperson is like, awesome. Can you close by the end of the month? And they're like, oh, I'm not sure, but I need that 20%. So folks, the secret to avoiding all of this is to actually, like, flip the give get paradigm on its head. You wanna get something in return before you give something to your prospect. And so, we're gonna walk through how to, like, execute that in practice in three steps in a negotiation. So step number one is confirming vendor of choice. Step number two is locking down your deal. And then step number three is executing the give get paradigm. Let's walk through step number one, which is confirming vendor of choice. The biggest problem that a lot of sales people run into when they start a negotiation is they start a negotiation when the prospect hasn't even earned the right to negotiate with you. In other words, you might get sliced apart by a CFO 10% by 10% by 10% in a seven call negotiation. And at the end of the negotiation, when your quote goes from, like, a 100 k down to, like, 30 k, they just go and take that quote and bring it to your competitor and make them match it and then go with your competitor. If you are not already the vendor of choice, if the customer has not explicitly said independent of price, I would move forward with you. In other words, if all of your quotes were exactly the same, I would move forward with you, then you have not earned the right to negotiate with me. So that is literally what you're gonna ask them, is you're gonna say something along the lines of, like, hey, Jane. I totally get it. I know you wanna talk about price. Before we even get to, like, the economics of all of this stuff, I wanna make sure that this isn't a complete waste of time, and you actually wanna work with us. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. So let's pretend that us and everyone else that you were looking at were the exact same cost. Independent of price, are we your vendor of choice? And so nine times out of 10, if you've run a good sales cycle, their answer will be something like, yes. But within reason, you can't be three times as expensive as your competitor. And now I know, like, okay. I'm at least the vendor of choice, and they wanna move forward with me. And in the worst case scenario, if I had to match a competitor, I would still win the deal. That's the first step. So we already got the customer's commitment that they're gonna close. I I now need to get the customer's commitment that they're gonna close on time. So step number two is I've got a lockdown timeline. So this is when you can start to make your CFO the bad guy. And you're gonna say something like this. Totally get and I think you'd be an awesome customer too. The other thing that I wanna caveat upfront before we get into any of these economics is my guess is, like, you're probably gonna wanna talk through the proposal and you're gonna ask me for a million things, and I'm gonna have to bring something back to my CFO. If I bring a proposal back to my CFO, the number one question they are going to ask me is, hey, Arman, as you remember, you have to hit a forecast. I have to hit a forecast to my board. We are willing to pay for our ability to predict. Has this customer told us they're explicitly going to sign at the end of the month? So I have to ask that question to you. If we are able to get to a number and a proposal that your team is happy with, can you get a contract inked by x date? And that means through legal, through security, through every internal approval. You know what your buying process looks like. Can you get through all of those steps? And if the answer is no, then you should say, look, then we need to, like, map out those steps and get to some reasonable timeline that we can commit to because we can't come up with a proposal that just has no backstop to it because we are coming forward and we just ask for your commitment and return to you. But if they say, yeah, I can get this done by the end of the month, you might pressure test it and be like, okay, what does legal look like? What does security look like? What does IT look like? What does all these other things look like? And if they can get it done by the end of the month, the last thing you're gonna do before you move forward is you're gonna say, like, awesome. So I just wanna preface this upfront because these conversations get uncomfortable later. Anything that we work on today will be contingent on us getting this done by x date. If we are not able to get this done by x date, I wanna share this now because it gets really uncomfortable later. I know my CFO is going to take over the proposal, and I'm not saying that we are literally, like, gonna start over from scratch. But what I can say is the number will not be that number if we are not able to get this done at the end of the month. Are you good with that? Awesome. Great. You gotta take those uncomfortable conversations when your deal slips, and then you're, like, being, like, oh, now your quote is gonna go up from, like, 70 to 80. Like, that's the way that you blow up a deal entirely is a customer feels, like, slapped in the face because they were trying to get legal done, and you never told them how much you were gonna raise their price. And, like, next thing you know, the deal slips, and now you're just, like, jacking up their price without warning them. You gotta tell them upfront that if this deal slips, I'm telling you right now, I'm gonna have to take this proposal away, and this number's gonna go up. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright? Have that conversation upfront, and your life will get much easier later. And also the timeline will have some teeth to it because you've already told them that the price is gonna go up. So that brings us to the third step, and this is when the negotiation actually begins. So as a recap, like, these are three steps that you should do before any negotiation happens. There are multiple more steps that I'll go through in some other video where we actually walk through, like, every step you go through inside of a negotiation. But the final step is you start to execute the give, get, and guess what? The third step is get them to take a step forward and give you the number before you give anything in return. In other words, you need to get their number before you give them a discount. So what that usually sounds like is this. Again, at the beginning of this call, let's assume that we've already given price, and they asked us for some sort of concession. And let's say that they gave us something generic where it's like, your price is too expensive. I went through step one. I confirmed that I'm the vendor of choice. Hey. Independent of pricing. Let's just pretend that we were the same cost. Are we the vendor of choice? Great. We're in the right place. Cool. Hey. I'm not saying that we can get to whatever number you wanna be on. Number two, I gotta lock down my deal. Hey. If we get to a number that you're happy with, are we able to close on time? They say yes. Awesome. Now we get to step three. Hey, I can't take a total shot of the dark because if I go back to my CFO and I'm like, I don't know where they need to be, but I think $70 will get it done. My CFO's is gonna look at me, and they're gonna be like, you're telling me that you want me to negotiate against myself and shoot in the dark, and you don't even know if this deal is gonna come in at this number? We don't do the whole used car salesman thing here where we go through cut after cut after cut. I need to know what you have in budget and what you can get done with your team. You need to tell me that, and then I can go back to my boss, and we can get this done in one cut. Otherwise, I might not get to the right number the first time, and then you're gonna be like, I need more. And then I'm gonna be like, there's nothing I can do because I only get one shot with my team. That's how you speed up a negotiation. You get them to say, like, this is what gets you to a win, and then you just take that whole thing. And that's not just price. So you usually start with price. It's like, okay. So, like, that's the number you need to be at. But, like, you've seen this proposal. Like, you know, the billing terms, you know, all the other, like, fine print inside of this. I'm not saying you need to redline this whole contract right now, but, like, are there other commercial terms that you're gonna ask for? Because I need to bundle this all together in one package. And now you can start to force them to make trade offs in the negotiation where it's like, okay. You want, like, 70 k instead of a 100 k, but you also want, like, monthly payments on net 90. It's like, I I can't get you down to 70 and all that stuff. I probably can't get you to 70 at all. I can probably get, like, an 8 in front of it if you pay it all up front, or it's probably in, like, the higher rates if you don't pay everything up front and you want this in monthly payments just because we care about cash. And now I can start to force the customer to make trade offs so that anytime I'm giving them something, whether it's price billing terms or something else, they are giving me something or I'm getting something in return. I'm getting a higher price in return for those billing terms. And that's how you finish your negotiations quickly is every single thing they ask for, you create a cost to it. So eventually, it's like every time they're like, give me 10%. They're like, oh, you stabbed me in the side. Give me 20%. Oh, you got me over here. And then eventually, like, they stop asking you for stuff. So those are your three steps. Confirm you're the vendor of choice, lock down your deal, and confirm timeline. And then the third is execute the give get, or in other words, get their number before you give anything in return. Alrighty, folks. If you like this one, let me know in the comments the number one negotiation thing that you'd like us to cover next. Like, subscribe, follow on the channel. It's the number one way that you can support us doing more videos like this. And the last thing that I'll share is, we have an entire write up. I did, like, a two part negotiation series in our newsletter that breaks down, like, what to do before negotiation, which is really this video, and then what to do during the negotiation to, like, create options and trade offs to speed up your deal. I'll put links to both of those here in the show notes, and we'll see you on the next one. Peace, folks.
