## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Ahmad Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have a legend in the space of venture capital, one of the premier go to market leaders in the world. It's mister Doug Landis. Nick, why should people listen? This is a really interesting episode where you might not wanna show up to your discovery calls anymore with a checklist of 432 questions. Doug talks about instead showing up with a point of view. And so this is one where if you wanna lay the groundwork for a pretty dang good discovery call, you may want to consider listening to this episode. Three, two, one. My point of view is you should listen to this episode. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Doug. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. K. Number one, are you open to? These are really, really important words I suggest you start to use. The reality is, for me, I'm a linguist at heart. Words really matter. When you're reaching out to somebody to get access to some level of resource, whether it's an introduction, you want a meeting with them, and you want something from someone, the words you use are really important. So when you end an email or a LinkedIn message or even a voice message and you say, could you, will you, do you have time for fifteen minutes for a call, Those are very black and white questions or requests. I suggest you use something a little bit softer for me as the recipient, your prospects as the recipient using words like, are you open to making an introduction? Are you open to a five minute conversation? Are you open to something? It's basically suggesting, are you open or are you closed? If you use the wrong words, I'm gonna close off. Using words like are you open to, very powerful. Beautiful. What's number two, Doug? Number two. I call it why change? This is kind of my anti discovery phase if you think about it. At the end of the day, we have done a terrible job for all of you sellers because we've drilled qualification criteria like BANT, TEMP, ANIM, whatever, NEAT, whatever acronym you wanna come up with. And then we also compile that with discovery questions that you should be asking to really understand the pain and the problem. At the end of the day, as a buyer, none of that is beneficial to me. And oftentimes, not even relevant. The reality is the conversation that I wanna have, and I highlight the word conversation because at the end of the day, we should be having a business conversation, not discovery or qualification. But a business conversation is about what's going on in my current state, how bad is that, and why would I ever wanna change away from that. If you can anchor your conversations, including qualification and discovery, whatever categories you want to identify them with, around this idea of, I need to have a conversation with you and you need to share with me in your words why changing away from what you're currently doing might make sense, that's the conversation that buyers wanna have, and that's the conversation you need to get prepared to have with your prospects. Nice. Alright, Doug. Round us out. What's number three? Number three. At the end of the day, if you wanna be a professional seller, you really need to anchor around your behaviors. Look. In any deal over $10,000 there are at least eight to 10 buyers involved in a buying decision. What's happened over the last three years? Guess what? Executives are getting involved in lower level conversations. So there's a lot of people you could and should be engaged with and talking to in your prospects. Not every meeting has to be with the decision maker. Doesn't even have to be a meeting. So don't stop reaching out to more than one or two people in an organization. Additionally, it takes a while for us to respond. We're busy as buyers. And it takes at least eight to 10 touches to get somebody to respond even if it's just a not right now. Because at the end of the day, if you really think about prospecting, it's about timing and relevance. So if you wanna be a professional seller, don't stop yourself short. Don't stop at one or two touches. Don't stop at one or two people in an organization. Keep going because that account is not dead. So it's actually interesting. I used to work with a salesperson who would spend hours, like, belaboring over their sign off. Would you be horribly, utterly opposed to potentially taking a meeting with me to learn more about this? Like, and they would spend so much time wasted on coming up with their CTA that the advice I gave them was, like, be like Mark Zuckerberg when he's picking out his outfit. He wears the exact same thing every single day. And you should just make the decision once what your call to action is gonna be. And I like yours. Are you open to learning more about x? Pick that. Make that your CTA and move on with your life. So let's say someone responds to my CTA, Doug. They are open to learning more, and they're the buyer. And I'm scheduling a business conversation, or some might know it as a discovery call, with said buyer. You have been on the buying side and the selling side in your career, and you were talking to me on the preshow about what buyers actually want in that first meeting, what they actually want to accomplish, and they want what they want that experience to look like. Can you tell me what that experience actually is and how salespeople can adjust to their advantage? Yes. Amen. Appreciate the question because often what buyers want and need from sellers is not what sellers show up prepared to offer. What oftentimes sellers are prepared to show up to offer are qualification questions or discovery questions. Tell me more about this. Tell me more about your business. Tell me more about your problem. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Just think about those words. Tell me. What are you doing when you say those two words? You're saying all the work is on you. The onus is on you, mister buyer, missus buyer. So So you it's up to you to to shape this conversation. Well, that's not my job. My job is to figure out how I can solve for this problem that I have as quickly and easily as possible. So when you come to this conversation with a whole slew of questions, it doesn't help. The reality is, as a buyer, I've already been going through a process on my own of which you largely are thinking about, well, is this really all that bad? And if it's really bad, then I start talking to other people. I talk to my peers. I talk to my friends. I start to evaluate what are other people doing to solve or handle this situation. And once I get that feedback from my peers, then I start maybe doing a little bit more research. But during that, I'm also trying to prioritize. And then you get on a call with me, and you start peppering me with questions. And it gives me, as the buyer, anxiety. And what I wanna do is I wanna get the hell off the call, and I wanna give you the answers that you want so that you'll give me either a demo or you'll tell me all about the product so I can quickly make a decision and then move on. The best way to approach this as a seller is to show up prepared. Have a prepared mind. Have a hypothesis or a point of view about my industry, about my company, and about me and my role and some of the problems I likely might struggle with. Again, I'm using really important words here. I might struggle with. The truth is if you show up to a conversation with a point of view about my world, it doesn't have to be right. But it shows that you put in a little bit of work, that you did the work versus making me do all the work. You showed up with some thought about what's going on in my industry, what's going on in my company, what's going on in my world. So, Doug, let's say that I jump into a meeting and I set my agenda. And now instead of peppering you with bant or med picking you over the head or asking you a million situational questions, I now wanna display some sort of point of view or some sort of industry expertise. So I've set my agenda. What do I do now? Most of the time, people just set the agenda. Here are the things we're gonna talk about, and off we go. What's often missed is what's the purpose? Why are we all here? What's the plan, I. E. The agenda? And how much time are we gonna spend talking about each area? Or what's the outcome that both you and I want from our time together? We often forget about that. We just do exactly what you just said. We throw up the agenda. And then what do we do? We throw we launch right in from we transition from agenda to questions. I'm suggesting transition from agenda to a point of view. So I'll give you an example. So, Arman, as I was preparing for our meeting today, opener, I thought, well, you know, what's really interesting what's going on in the world of SaaS technology, they're getting hammered in the markets. Everyone is doing layoffs, seemingly so. So I I'd be curious given the fact that you're a compensation platform, how this is affecting your business. People still need to hire. People still need to know what's going on in the markets. Although I imagine given the fact that maybe hiring the power shifted to the employer employers, maybe they're curious if if comp ratios have gone down because we know the last couple of years they got a little out of hand. As I was thinking about this and do you see what I'm doing? I'm just having a a kind of a general hypothesis about what I think might be going on, and then I'm gonna take it down into your world. Look, as a VP of sales situation, you might be wondering, okay, well, how do I continue to hit my targets? How do I maybe filter out the companies that are no longer a fit for us and reorient my ICP? How do I continue to motivate my teams even though we're partially remote or hybrid? Do you see what I'm doing? So I start company in the industry, and now I'm down to you and the role. Of course, I don't know what I'm selling right now. So this conversation this this example is a little wonky. But I'm coming to you with a point of view, and then my next my question is is how does this resonate with you? So what I'm asking for is validation, and you either get to validate or refute it, but I'm not asking you to to answer a whole slew of questions, at least not yet. It's interesting, this approach you talk about, because it's really similar to someone I know you're you're friends with, Joe Caprio, who, when we had him on the show last, he called this incenting interest. And the idea is you're showing up and you're saying, you know what? It's really interesting. I I don't normally get to talk to VPs of sales who came from the banking industry, for example. What you're doing is you're pointing out something that, like, is an observation that you had that is relevant to the conversation you're about to have. And the reason for it is it it sort of replaces the crummy small talk where you're you're chumming about the weather, and you're also showing, hey. I actually did my research. And it opens up the other person way, way more. Yes. However, I have a purpose to my flow. I'm not doing this just to kind of build connection or credibility. I'm doing this because I fundamentally wanna get down to the brass tacks of understanding your current state or demonstrating that I think I understand, I might understand your current state and why you might want to change away from that. Right? I'm not doing that just to buy some time or like, you know, so we're buddy up and chum it out. I'm not doing that. I'm doing it for a purpose because I wanna show you that I've given this some thought. I've done my homework. I think I have a fairly decent idea what might be going on in your world and why you might have been out on our website searching for information or gone to this webinar or downloaded this white paper. And the fundamental question that I have for you, the conversation I really want to get to, is twofold. Number one, why might you want to change away from what you're currently doing? And number two, our jobs are to help our buyers make a decision. Do you know how hard it is for buyers to make a decision? We've got preference stability. Change is really hard. We've got selection difficulty. Too many options. I don't know what to do. How do I prioritize? How do I evaluate this in terms of my risk tolerance? All sorts of things. And that's why deals end up in dead no decision. And so imagine if you came to a conversation and said, you know, listen, Nick, the one thing that I I wanna do, my one single goal between you and I is I wanna help you to make a decision. Even if that decision is sticking with what you're currently doing, at least you're consciously making a choice that you're gonna stick with what you're doing. So, Doug, I'm I'm curious. At what point when you're trying to understand if this is something even worth partnering on or solving on, I guess, at what point do you feel like you've done enough discovery such that you can propose some sort of potential solution or perhaps even a next step in the discovery process? I'm going to break this up into two pieces. There's next step and then there's why us, right? So if I'm selling to you, Armand, I want to know first and foremost why you think changing away from your current state makes sense. That's step number one. Step number two, we're not even there yet, is why do it now versus waiting? So let's just say you agree that, yeah, maybe moving away from however I was managing my forecast process isn't really the best. And you're like, there's a lot of, there's a lot of angst there. Well, the next step is like, well, why would you want to do something now? What's going to drive your urgency to make a decision now or do something now versus waiting three, six, nine months? And that's part two of the conversation. Once you get through one and two, and there's clarity around you wanting to change, and there's clarity around the cost associated with not changing, I. E. Why now, then you're you've earned the right to talk about why us. Typically, salespeople go backwards. They start they lead with why us, and then they're like, okay, cool. I'm gonna ask a whole bunch of questions to back our way into why change and why now. And the reason why deals push is because there's no urgency, because we didn't focus on why changing and the cost associated with not changing. So, Doug, I wanna call out one of the things that you brought up in the early part of the interview where you were saying buyers hate it when you jump onto a discovery call and you just pepper them with 3,000 questions. And these questions feel like they're in the way of them just wanting to see the damn product so they can make an evaluation for yourself. Right? So I'm curious. Yep. What are you doing differently in either the way that you're asking questions, the way you're telling stories, the way you're giving examples or case studies or developing a point of view? What are you doing differently in that process where you are essentially saying, I'm not gonna talk about my product. I'm gonna still withhold that. How are you asking questions and using stories and all of that stuff in a way that does not feel like an interrogation, which many discovery calls traditionally feel like? I think, you know, my good buddy, Todd Capone, has captured this in a book called the transparency sale, which is it's all about being transparent. Like, listen. If you just want a demo of our product, you can go to our website. If you want me to just walk you through click by click what our product could do, awesome. Great. Don't know if it's really gonna be helpful. I'm in the job of being helpful. If you really do need to ask a handful of questions just to see if it's like, because you know what? At the end of the day, you're you're because your company, you've got too many people. Right? And so it's like, man, our product kinda caps out, you know, if at a 100 users. If you're above that, then it's not gonna work. Fine. Then do that. But just set my ask you just a handful of questions so that we can at least just check the box and move, and I know that you're a fit. Otherwise, it doesn't even make sense for us to continue talking, right? So just set my expectation that you're gonna ask me five, six, a handful of questions and that there's good reason behind it. Oftentimes, sellers get on the phone, and what do they do? They just start peppering. They just start firing away. And as a buyer, I'm like, where are you going with this? This is not valuable for me. This is way more valuable for you. At the end of the day, it's not valuable for me, so I'm trying to get off the phone. What you're doing here that's really powerful is you are giving in the name of the transparency, Cel, you're giving the reason that you are asking the other person to share information with you. And one of the things that we have learned is anytime that you have an ask of the other person, you have to explain why complying with that ask is in their best interest. Whether it's you're asking them to see a demo, you're asking them to answer your tech stack questions, you're asking them to introduce you to a colleague of theirs. You must explain why it is in their best interest. And what you're doing when you say, hey. I have 12 questions here that I need to ask you to help me understand whether or not we could even work with you as a business because if your answer to some of those questions is no, like, we actually can't help you, the person is far more likely to say, well, tell me your questions because it's in their best interest to like, it's in your mutual best interest. And I think a lot of people don't understand that your job is to articulate the reason to the customer. You know that it's in your mutual best interest. But if they don't, then you're gonna get four questions in, and they're gonna be like, how many more questions do you have for me? Doug, let's say that we've finally gotten someone to agree to the why change at all. Right? And before we go into the why us, you talked about why now. What is the right way to ask why now other than saying, when do you want to buy this thing? Now we both understand that changing weight from what you're currently doing, it makes sense. Let's now, you and I together, Armand, dig into why it might make sense doing this now rather than waiting three, six, nine months. Right? So you would probably be going, sure. Okay. That sounds great. Now what what are we gonna dig into? Well, one of the things I wanna highlight here is my conversation with Sue, who is VP of sales over at Coca Cola. She was sharing with me that what she realized after the fact is every day she waited to make this change, she realized it was costing her two customer meetings. I'm curious. What do you think it's costing you by sticking with what you're currently doing? Because at the end of the day, I'm out of role play. At end of the day, people make decisions based on cost, loss, and suffering. Pain. How bad is that pain? They don't make changes based on the promised land that you're painting this picture for. And so if you wanna have this why now conversation, first of all, the question you're gonna ask is like, well, why would you wanna do it now? Why do you think doing it now makes sense? Because at the end of the day, I understand, because I've had this conversation with VPs of sales all day, every day, that you're gonna have to go through and sell this internally. There's gonna be a process and I we'll talk about that. But fundamentally, as your boss, as your CFO, I'm guarantee you, they're gonna wanna know, well, why do we have to do this now versus waiting? And if you come to them with, hey, listen, if we don't do this now, it's gonna cost us, but we're losing customers. There's just more difficulty and it's costing in a long run. That's the things that are gonna get people to buy into that. What you did in that role play was really powerful, Doug, because I used to get trained I should be asking my customer, when are you looking to make a decision? And I started asking that question, and every single buyer, every single one said yesterday. And I'd be like, well, that's not very helpful. I can't put that in my forecast. And what's really interesting what you did there was you almost told this micro story about another customer, Sue, where you sort of again, you almost incented the pain where you were like, hey. This is the pain that somebody else dealt with that prompted them to make a timely decision. I'm wondering if that's even relevant to your world. And you're sort of touching on telling, like, a micro story. And one of the things that you said in the preshow to us was you were talking about the power of storytelling. And I'm wondering if you can give me the quick hits on, like, what goes into an effective sales story, and then maybe what goes into an ineffective sales story that I should be avoiding. But at the end of the day, as a buyer, I wanna know that I'm not alone in this. This is why it's so important we build connection, demonstrate credibility, and show empathy because I need to know I'm not alone. When you're peppering me with questions and it's just you and me, I feel very isolated and scared because making a decision, by the way, is scary for a lot of people. And so if you bring in Sue, who's another VP of sales, into the conversation, all of a sudden I'm like, I'm not alone. I I wonder if I could talk to Sue. That's super powerful. And by the way, it also gets you out of the picture. You're just the messenger now. Now I wanna know, like, who else have you talked to? What are their VPs of sales? What do they say? What did you learn from them? Because that's what I wanna know. I don't wanna know because I don't really trust you. Unfortunately, you're in sales, and I'm afraid you're just gonna manipulate me. I've been manipulated before, and it hasn't worked out in my best interest. So let's just say you wanna bring in that Sue, Sue character into the conversation. If you're gonna tell a story, there's some very simple tactics that have to be true. If they're not true, then your story sucks. Factors that are true. Number one, you have to be really, really clear about the point that you're trying to make with that story. So if I'm gonna tell you a story about Sue, VP of sales over at Coca Cola, I gotta be really clear about the point that I'm trying to make with that story. You gotta be articulate. And I need to know the point of that story in one sentence or less. Number two, there has to be a character. One of the things you'll notice, I said, Sue, a VP of sales at Coca Cola. I didn't say, well, I was talking to somebody over at Coca Cola. No one cares. I need a person with a name and a title. I also need a setting. Now it would have been helpful if I said, well, look. Two weeks ago, I was talking to Sue, VP of sales at Coca Cola, because it could have been two years, ten years. If you give me a setting two weeks ago or just yesterday or this morning or, hey. I've got a call tomorrow with Sue. Give me a setting. Give me some context because that's what helps you to take me on a journey. That journey is either from what was to what is or what is to what could be. And then typically, there's no moment, right, in a story. That's like, woah. You know what? I was yesterday, when I was on the phone with Sue, VP of sales over at Coca Cola, she shared with me that, you know, she was struggling with forecast. In fact, you know, it was just recently the end of the quarter, mid year, and she thought she was crushing it. But as it turned out, they missed by 15%. Whew. That sucks. Then I got this moment. But what was the turning point? Well, what Sue realized was the forecast was actually right in Salesforce, but it was wrong in practice. Whatever it is. I'm making this stuff up. So the story itself has it's got some juice. Right? Because you've got a person, a character, or characters. You've got a setting, the time and the place when it started. You've got some drama. Right? Something happened, and you've got a turning point. So, Doug, in the prep call, you talked about two times you bought software, and they nearly got you fired. And my guess is one of the reasons you're using these stories is because you're trying to tell people, hey. Other customers, same stage, same set of problems. You are not completely alone or unique in this problem. We've helped other people before. Right? You're trying to ease them into that so that they know they're not the first person to buy the first iPhone that was ever released. Right? And hopefully, it doesn't explode in their pocket. I'm curious. Are there other things that you're doing either in this call or throughout the sales cycle to get people outside of that initial zone of resistance where they're like, oh my god. If I don't buy IBM, I'm gonna get fired. I think at the end of the day, we constantly need to remind ourselves that in every interaction we have with somebody, our job is to build connection, demonstrate some level of credibility, and you do that through what we've learned from our customers. And then, of course, to show empathy. And we do that by giving some sense of thought about the other person and their world. Right? So if you keep reminding yourself of those three things, we need to build connection, demonstrate credibility, and show empathy. You can do that all day every day with your prospects, with every single person that you're tasked to reaching out to. Think about that. What have I done? And after a call, what did I do to build connection, demonstrate credibility, and show empathy? And there are ways in which marketing can do that by sharing, you know, by sharing stories or ROI statistics or whatever it may be, whatever materials that you need to demonstrate to me as the buyer that, hey, I'm not alone. You're an expert. You've done this before, and so I can trust you. But the thing that I think is really important that you have to I think it's really important to acknowledge Acknowledge the fact that making a decision is scary and hard. There are risks associated with it. If I make a decision again, significance value, I could get fired. Call it out. Acknowledge the fact that, you know, Arman, I recognize the fact is the VP of Sales, if you make an investment, especially around forecasting, and it doesn't play out and you miss your forecast, I can imagine how frightening that would be. Other sales leaders that I've spoken to, they miss their forecast more than two months in a row, more than two quarters in a row, they're out. So I can only imagine the trepidation of making a decision around something like this might be. Share things about what you might know and understand about the what the buyer's going through. Change is really hard. How to drive change in the organization, by the way. Have you ever given thought? And this is to you sellers. Have you ever given it thought what it's like to implement and how many people have to actually learn how to use this new product? We talk about so if you just think about on the other end, what what's involved, you can actually start to empathize even more. And so to your question, what can you do? I can I can share an anecdote about a conversation that I've had? I can share what other companies have done. I can suggest that, like, listen, I recognize making this decision is likely scary. Beautiful. Man, Doug, this was a golden episode, and you're making me thirsty for a Coca Cola. But we're running out of time here, and so we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We talked a lot about good things salespeople should be doing, and now I gotta ask you about the inverse. And so the final question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Not doing their homework. Do you know how many prospecting emails that I get? Like, do you know what your response is? I see you're a growth partner. I would love to talk to you about how we can help add more leads to your I'm like, are you kidding me right now? Do your homework. Show up to every every interaction that you have with a prospect or a customer with just demonstrating a little bit of effort. Boom. Don't be lazy. Do your homework. Be an a student or at least an a minus student. Okay. Be an a student. Doug, thank you so much for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Doug Landis include, number one, PPO, purpose, plan, outcome. Why are we here? How are we spending the time? And what's the outcome of the call gonna be? Number two, you gotta answer three questions, and you gotta answer them in this order. Number one is why change? Number two is why now? And then an only then, why us? Number three, after that, after you set that agenda and you go in that order, you should start with a point of view instead of peppering them with 3,000 qualification or traditional discovery questions. And then lastly, number four, when you do decide to ask some questions, soften the CTA instead of asking heavy questions by possibly changing to would you be open to type of questions. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Well, folks, if you haven't yet connected with me and Arman and LinkedIn, you're missing something. I've asked a couple times. So instead of my usual normal ask, I'm gonna hit you with a why change, a why now, and a why us. First, why change? Why would you wanna change from the status quo and connect with somebody like Armand on LinkedIn? Well, if you do that, you might change your state and you might become a better salesperson. Well, okay. That sounds interesting. But why would you wanna become a better salesperson now? Well, it's a tough market out there. It's tough to sell. And if you become a better salesperson today, you kick off the butterfly effect of making more money and leveling up in your career. But why us? Why Nick? Why Armond? Why connect? Why waste two valuable connection requests with these jokers? Well, believe it or not, we post things like episode summaries, our favorite tips and nuggets that we learn on the show, and occasionally pictures of Nick and Armond on the beach hanging out. So there's my ask. Why change? Why now? Why us? And why not? See you next week on thirty minutes to presidents club.
