## Transcript

Hey, guys. I bet you're wondering where Armand and Nick are, and the answer is not here today. I'm Sarah Brashear, and I am taking over this club playbook where I'm going to be teaching you discovery. Discovery, much like a good meal, is a process that needs to be experienced. So today, we'll talk about what's on the menu or how to set an agenda, setting the table or setting up yourself for success, digging into discovery before finally bringing out the dessert menu and recommending next steps. So we are going to get started in three, two, one. Let's go. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Awesome. So when you start a discovery call, the first thing that you're going to do is tell your customers objectives of the call and the desired outcome, and then finally, call out any unspoken objections. So it might sound something like this. Hey, Armand. Thanks so much for taking the time to talk with me. Do we still have thirty minutes? Fantastic. So the objective of today's call is to understand a little bit more about your business. I have an idea about some of the challenges you might be experiencing, but I really wanna dig into those today. The other thing that I wanna do is share a little bit about some of the key challenges CROs like yourself are experiencing before finally figuring out if this is a good fit for you. So the outcome of this call could either be, one, you say, hey. This is interesting. I wanna learn more, in which case, we'll book a meeting. Two, you'll say, this is interesting, but I have some concerns, in which case we can schedule time to talk about those concerns. Or three, you might say, Sarah, this is terrible. I don't wanna know any of this stuff. In which case, we'll go, that's fine. And we will shake hands and part ways friends. Does that sound fair? Finally, I'll call out some unspoken objections. Hey, Armand. I understand that you might be using one of our competitors and you probably have some concerns about how we stack up. So we can definitely take some time in this conversation to talk about some of our key differences. Or you could say something like, hey, Armand. I understand you have some concerns about recording calls. So I wanna talk to you a little bit about how you can make sure your reps don't feel like your big brother and actually use this information to help you win some of your big bets this year. Next, we are going to set the table. This is where you're going to show your customer that you know them. You're going to teach your customer something, and then you're gonna get confirmation that you're in the right place. A lot of reps go straight into asking questions, and it feels like an interrogation. You don't want that. Instead, do your research ahead of time. So you can go to places like a quarterly earnings report or Seeking Alpha or your customer's 10 k. Or if they're not publicly traded, a really great place to go is LinkedIn. Read their profile. Look at their company news. Or if you can't find anything there, search the industry that they work in and look at some of the industry trends from Gartner, McKinsey, etcetera. The next thing you'll do is your teacher customer something. So this is where you wanna come with a unique perspective, and then finally, get confirmation. This might sound something like this. Hey, Armand. I saw on LinkedIn that you were just at your SKO at Santa Monica, and some of your reps posted about how you brought CBI in and rolled out some new messaging. On top of that, I was taking a look at your website, and I saw that you guys are rolling out a new product and rolled out a different product last year. So it looks a little bit like you're moving from a single product to a platform sale. Is that fair? When I say is that fair, then I get confirmation that that's the world that my customer is living in. Then I wanna teach them something. Hey, Armand. One of the things that I've learned from spending time with CROs like yourself and doing some research from areas like McKinsey and Gartner is and I might fill in the blank with things like strategic initiatives a lot of times end up failing, or your rep productivity is low. It's at an all time low right now. Or things like 53% of deals that reps put into commit don't ever close, and explain some of the reasons and then tie that back into the research I've done. So if I know that according to Mackenzie, 70% of strategic initiatives fail, and Armand just rolled out a new platform play, new messaging, and is rolling out a new product. Those are big bets that he's taking, and I can incorporate those two together and explain why that might be challenging, some concerns he might have, and the root causes of why that status quo that he lives in is problematic, and is it going to manifest the reality he wants? And then I'll get confirmation. Is this your life? As I get confirmation, that's an opportunity for me to move to the next stage, which is digging in. You've agreed that the problem is a problem, so you wanna talk about why. The way that you talk about why is very important. You wanna do things like ask about impact and quantify where you can. And then the other thing you wanna do in this section is talk about areas where you can differentiate or ask questions where you know you can differentiate. So you've agreed he's rolling out this new product. It's going to be challenging. He's rolled out new messaging. Getting all the reps to sing the same song at the same time is important. But ask why. Armand, nobody just rolls out a new product. Just roll it out. I imagine you're probably doing that for a couple reasons. Either you have a very competitive space, which I've noticed that sales technology is getting increasingly more competitive. So you're trying to differentiate and kick out more competitors. Or two, you might be doing things like trying to increase your TAM. Is that what's going on? Yes? No? Great. Why? Why is that happening? So what is the impact that you're trying to get? Like, if you're rolling out a new product, I imagine there's some kind of revenue number that you're chasing after, and that's where I can quantify where I can. I'm gonna continue to ask questions like that throughout the discovery process. And then the other thing that I might do, and this is what a lot of reps don't do, is ask about areas where I know I can differentiate. Here's the thing. If your customer is evaluating you, then they're evaluating your competitors. They don't do these things in a silo. The second thing is that the economy sucks right now, and we are selling in a downturn, which means your biggest competitor is the status quo. So you should be asking questions that can open up areas where you can differentiate and provide more value than what they're experiencing today. So I might ask a question like this. Hey, Armand. Are you recording calls right now? And Armand says, yes. We are. Hey, Armand. How are you getting consent for those calls that you're recording? The reason I ask is because a lot of our customers sell in different continents like you, and selling in Germany or in Europe is very different than selling in The States or in Australia. So having the ability to control consent and capture that is really important, and it's not something that's easy to do with traditional recording tools. Have you ever thought about that? This opens up a great area for me to differentiate, which, again, if he's using a competitor, I can then make that a stake that I ground myself to, or I can add additional value later on in the conversation as we continue down this evaluation. So now that we've got a ton of information from our customers about the problem that they have, the root cause of that problem, the impact of that problem, and we've quantified it, and then we've been able to sprinkle in a little differentiation. This is where we finished our meal, we're feeling full, we're good. And as the waiter, we walk up to the customer and we say, how about some dessert? Most reps will just pivot to their demo and ask for next steps here. But instead, you wanna do something different. You wanna summarize what you've heard from your customer. You wanna get them to stack rank what you've heard. Hey, Armand. I heard a bunch of things from you today. You are rolling out all of these new products. You've got this new messaging. You're placing some big bets, and it's gonna result in x y z amount of revenue for you. If you had to stack rank those in order of importance and there are no ties, what would that sound like? Great. Now I know exactly where he's falling down. Hey, Armand. A customer of mine actually had the exact same challenge. They were rolling out a new product. When they rolled out that new product, they realized that they were not manifesting the revenue dollars that they thought they would as fast as they would. When they implemented Gong, they were able to get immediate visibility into what was happening. And the reality was is that all of their reps were pitching the product entirely differently, and their top rep was using a script that enablement had never come up with. So what they ended up doing was taking that top rep script, replicating it, and rolling it out in a training to all of their team, and then they use Gong to enforce that training and help onboard reps and reinforce it throughout time. This resulted in 20% more revenue than they had been expecting. Something like that. And then once you've described the foretaste of the feast to come, you'll recommend next steps. Take ownership of this. So a lot of times reps will say, what do you wanna do next? Instead, just take ownership. Recommend them. Hey. The next step of our process here is for us to actually show you how we do that. Do you have time next week? Great. Now you can pull up a calendar and start to do that. As you pull up the calendar, you can do one other thing, which is ask about their process. Hey, Armand. While you're pulling up your calendar, I'm curious. When you've evaluated solutions like ours in the past, what does that process typically look like? This is where Armand is gonna tell me all about how procurement evaluates software, when legal needs to review red lines, what their security process looks like, whatever else. Who else is involved in the decision making process? And then when I get that information, I can say, okay. Great. Thursday, 03:00 in the afternoon. And by the way, why don't we add Paul to that invite or whomever is the person that has influence on the deal? Because then you can start to widen your audience. You might get some objections here around, oh, I'm not sure if Paul's the right person. In which case, you can go back to that upfront contract that you had where you said, hey. You might be intrigued, but you'll have some concerns. And then you can say, well, why don't we talk about those concerns that you have on the next call? And after that, if you're assuaged and satiated, then we'll go ahead and add Paul to our our third conversation down the line. Does that sound fair? Probably the answer will be yes. And that's it. That's all there is. That is discovery in a nutshell, the process. So a quick sixty second recap. Number one, have a plan and share it. Call out surprises before they surprise you. Number two, take control of the conversation by setting the tone. Remember that you're a problem solver, not a feature pusher. So start by talking about problems and why they exist, and then teach your customers something they don't know, and you'll gain credibility in their eyes. Number three, dig into their pains. You don't just want to ask qualification questions. You wanna understand their challenges today, and equally importantly, impact those have on their business. Bonus points if you set yourself up for competitive differentiation by asking questions about areas the prospect might not have considered, but you know can add extra value. And number four, tell them what's good on the dessert menu. Recommend they give it a try. I e, tell them what the next step is and secure it at the end of the call. That's it for me. If you like this and you want more, Nick and I will be doing a discovery call tear down. We will post the details in the show notes.

Hopefully, I'll be hearing from you guys soon. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
