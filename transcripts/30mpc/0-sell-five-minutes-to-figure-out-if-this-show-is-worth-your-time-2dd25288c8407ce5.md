## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to episode zero of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Armand Faroque, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Segalski. Hey. This is a sales call, so set the agenda. Armond, the purpose of this episode is so the listeners can figure out, do they or do they not listen to thirty minutes to presidents club? We're gonna give you four reasons why we think you should listen to the show. We're also going to end this mini episode with four actionable sales tactics. So if you get to the end of this five minutes and you realize we're not very good, at least you got something out of listening here. So let's start with number one, what we are not. Most sales podcasts get way too wrapped up in vague sales strategies, theory, and academia that you can't really go and use. We do not do that. Thirty minutes to president's club is only cold, hard sales tactics that you can rip, steal, and use today to make a difference in your sales job. Armand, what's number two? Number two is the preparation. And so this is thirty minutes to president's club. It's not thirty two or thirty seven and certainly not two hours to president's club. And so what you hear is thirty minutes, but what we actually record is forty five, and then we cut out a third of the crap. Some episodes, they don't make the cut. We also ask every guest to do a prep call with us, and sometimes they don't really like that. And if they don't agree to it, we don't record the episode. So, So, Nick, what's number three? Number three. Arman and I have two very different perspectives. I am an individual contributor and always have been. Arman is in sales leadership and oversees a team of 40. I sell massive long cycle enterprise deals. Armond and his team are getting quick mid market wins every single week. Two different perspectives, better show. What's for, Armond? Number four is the episodes are structured for absorption. So we start with an intro. We give you a sense of the guest clout. We tell you what you're in store for. At the beginning of every episode, we ask for three actionable tactics. So you can take those away, immediately put those into your sales toolkit. We end with a final question, and then we record a recap email. So at the end, you can document all of the key takeaways. Alright. Now we gotta do a little bit of giving. What are four actionable tactics, Nick? Alright. I'll start with number one. Number one, it's okay to tell a customer no. Let me give you some context for this. I sell these massive, long cycle, complex enterprise deals. And I still have customers who say, no. Let's just get to the demo. Let's get to the demo. And I have to tell them sometimes, look. We could show you probably a hundred hours worth of demos. There are a million different features and functionalities and functionalities and nooks and crannies that this thing addresses. And if we don't understand what's working for you right now, what's not working for you right now, and where you want this thing to go, we're probably not a great fit for you. And when you tell the customer no and you give some context, you usually get to where you need to be. There's my tip number one. Arman, give me number two. Number two is open on the phones by leading with context, not by how's your day going because I don't care. I'm trying to book a meeting. And and not by asking if it's a bad time because it's always a bad time for a sales call. And so pick your top buying trigger and lead with that and then introduce yourself. So it might sound something along the lines of, hey. We work with a number of Andreessen portfolio companies. It's Arman at Carta. Have you heard our name tossed around? And the reason that works is the moment I say we work with other Andreessen portfolio companies, they sit up, and then I can introduce myself. Nick, what's number three? So I've got a response to when you get a reply to your prospecting email that just says not interested. What do you do with that? Here's what I say. Armand, thanks so much for responding to my email. Was it just bad timing on my end, or was it a different reason? I don't wanna unnecessarily follow-up if it's a bad fit. Thank you, Nick. What that does is it forces the customer to give you a reason as to why it's not a good fit. Because if it truly is not a good fit, please don't bother them anymore. But if it is, now they have gone back and looked for a reason why, and I frequently have people say, oh, actually, are you available next week? Easy response. Use it every time. Armand, finish this out with four. It's a three by three email, and so no email should be longer than three bodies of text and three lines each when read on your phone. Context, value, ask. Context, why the heck are you reaching out? This is your buying trigger. Value, what do you do relative to that context? And then ask me for the meeting. Alrighty. So a lot of people are gonna ask you to subscribe right now, and frankly, don't click that button yet. I mean, if you want, you can. But instead, I would suggest you listen to episode one, and then if you like it, subscribe. And I would be horribly disappointed if you didn't like it. And so please DM me on LinkedIn if you didn't like it. Alrighty, folks. Catch you later. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power.
