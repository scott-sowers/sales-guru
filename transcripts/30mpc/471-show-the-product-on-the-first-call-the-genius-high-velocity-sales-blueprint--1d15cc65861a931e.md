## Transcript

You said show product in the first meeting. I can guarantee you 50% of sales leaders right now are thumping their sales bible saying you're going to hell. Don't demo. Do a product tour. The two things are different. We know that buyers are itching to see the product, and we know typically we need to do discovery to be able to unlock that. What often happens, especially in a high velocity sale when someone knows they're trying to move fast is that they're like, I just wanna see the product. And it's from a selling side, we're just saying, no, no, no. Please answer these. Starts the deal off on the wrong foot. The purpose of a product tour is almost the same elevator pitch that you would give in slides. Don't move slides, instead just show them, which means this is still something you can do within one minute, and it's still the purpose is to kick off your discovery. You're giving them a glimpse of the different capabilities of it, which often I found, one, allows you to start asking discovery questions sooner than you would. Two, you can start to see the kind of prospects reactions and feedback, and you can start to see what's peaking their curiosity and what's not. And that just allows you to actually start asking questions right there. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to the president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Marc Casaglow. And today, I'm talking really quickly. You know why Marc? Because we're talking about high velocity sales motion. The key to a high velocity sales motion is not speaking as quickly as humanly possible. It is listening to this episode with the one and only, Malika Sahei. So by background, I actually know Malika because I worked with a couple of coworkers from what we called the Segment mafia at Pave. And Segment had an elite go to market team as they went from 10 to a 100,000,000 plus in ARR and then eventually got acquired by Twilio for $3,000,000,000. Malika built and scaled the entire SMB sales and sales development organization over at Segment. She's done that at three different companies, and she knows high velocity selling better than almost anyone that I know. And this is a clinic and how to build that motion yourself. So, Mark, why should people listen? We didn't really talk about this specifically, but I think the reason that people should listen to this is we get into high velocity deals, which I think when people hear that, they think transactional. This is not about transactional deals. Transactional deals are deals where someone is just giving you money and you need to transact for them. That's the order taker philosophy. Right? Like, I stand at the ballpark. I take your money, give you a ticket. That's a transactional sale. High velocity sales is a mentality. It's an urgency. It's a it's a program that you run. Because you need to close a deal faster in order to have a better chance of winning, you create velocity in that deal, and it's high velocity. Right? So one way to might maybe look at it is for every thousand dollars of revenue, it takes you one day in a high velocity deal cycle to close it. So $3,000 deals should be done in three days if it's high velocity. $20,000 deals done in twenty days if high velocity. Anything longer than that, they still get you good rates. That's not high velocity. That's just a regular consultative deal. So I think we really get into how do you orchestrate a situation where you can speed your deals up and create a high velocity situation. And a three, two, one. That's right. Alrighty, Malika. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Number one, show, don't tell. Use a product tour in your first call, which is different than a product demo to give a glimpse of the solution rather than just using slides. Show your prospect versus just telling them allows you to way more quickly allow them to start asking questions to do discovery, potentially identify additional use cases and stakeholders. And in this, it's not a demo. You are talking about the solution. You're not diving into features, but rather you're telling a story with the product and using it to highlight the product's capabilities and use cases. For example, back when I was at Census, it is a tool that sends data from your data warehouse, where it lives into your your end tools, Salesforce, marketing tools, your customer success tools. In a product tour, for example, on the first first slide at the beginning, I may show the home page which shows all of my list of integrations saying, hey. My customer attributes are pulled from my data warehouse, sent into Salesforce's custom object for our CSMs to use. Someone can understand what this end state looks like. And using that, I'm gonna tell a story. I can tell the story around how Sensus is going to allow you to retrieve that customer data that usually since locked into a data warehouse and actually get it into the hands of your teams who need it every single day. And the way I'm gonna do this is by first very simply instead hooking up to my where the data, connection where the data lives. It could be my data warehouses. It could be other databases, anywhere your engineering teams are holding this data. Next, I'm gonna show how easy it is to set this up. Typically, the alternative is actually to write custom code. We all know that takes a very long time. Often, that means Python scripts wrapped in duct tape. Here, I'm gonna show you literally a flip of a switch, and it is up and running. And finally, I can show you how easy it is to see it in your integrations. And there, I'm gonna pause and start to do discovery, ask what piqued their curiosity. If I notice someone's eyes kinda flicker at a certain part, I'm gonna pause and ask that person what's going on, and that's gonna open the door of I've now given them a glimpse of the solution. Let's now talk about it, and I'm gonna start doing much deeper discovery and get to probably what would have taken me to the end of call two, hopefully, by partly through call one. Demo and stories, not in features. What's number two? Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost two deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Number two is talk their talk. Use their lingo to build credibility. Often, it takes a long time to build rapport and credibility. In high velocity sales, you don't have the luxury of time. Figure out what are a few phrases that they use that they would say to their peers, probably not to people outside their function, and drop that into your conversations. So earlier, I mentioned Python script, extraction, duct tape. No one else is gonna use that terminology except for maybe a couple data engineers talking amongst themselves. Soon as you see that, you'll often get a chuckle and tells you, okay. I'm speaking their language. I think I've earned more of the right to start asking the heavy hit questions. Boom. What's number three? Number three is think outside the box when it comes to trials. In high velocity sales, you can rewrite the playbook because you have to do things fast and still get the same outcome. So be creative when it comes to trialing the product. With a data integration product, instead of asking a company to hook up their production data warehouse, hook up their, let's say, Salesforce instances, I would need a security review, probably legal sign off and probably some sort of POC agreement for that. See if I can actually get a sandbox environment for my own company and allow those prospects to test up very similar workflows. As long as I can get to about 80% of that, the prospect ideally is seeing what they need to to get the technical validation. And if not, if they still need to test a little bit on their own instance, you now have at least a few days to do that in parallel while they're still testing it. So you get to that technical validation much faster. One of the things that we're learning so far are a constant theme on what we've talked about, Malika, is transactional sales. And I think that that has a different definitions for a lot of people. So when you say transactional, like, help me understand like, give me the overall context of what you mean by transactional. Yeah. When I think I think high velocity, which doesn't necessarily mean transactional. It still means you're selling a high value product. There's a lot of ROI to be proven. But in high velocity, you need to move fast. And this could happen in a few ways. It could be that there's a lot of similar products in the market, and so people understand the pain. They understand the types of solutions. They can go through the buying process much faster because there's already a line item in the budget. Or it could mean, let's say, you're selling to a small company that just needs to move fast. This could still be a category creation product. You just need to move fast to do that. And so I think transactional and high velocity can be overlapping. They don't have to be, but high velocity, you still need to achieve the same outcome that let's an enterprise deal with. You just have a very condensed amount of time to do it for either a product that's more simple or, let's say, a a lower price point, or there could be a couple of the characteristics. So we start all the way at the top of the funnel. You talked a lot about what an AE has to do different. So let's talk about how to get that high velocity velocity pipeline. Because if I'm closing deals in seven days, that means I got every seven days, I gotta replace a deal. Right? So how do you approach high velocity prospecting? Typically, in those in my experience in those, those are either, lower ACV or they're more like SMB kind of lower mid market. And so often those don't have BDR teams built out because the ROI just doesn't end up working out. So usually those organizations have a very heavy partnership with marketing who and they're actually gonna generate a lot of that inbound demand coming in. So you would expect every day you need to have at least one or two new, qualification calls coming in, and every week you are really building up qualified pipeline from a prospecting. And that that's where, like, I would think about outbound into a target account list. So it's gonna say for this month or for my quarter, there is the strategic logos. It could be still small deals or larger deals, but these are the ones we really wanna put everything behind, and we don't wanna do a big marketing campaign for them. We want AEs to really prospect into them. So in addition to running my qualification calls that are coming from inbound leads, I'm also doing a bit of prospecting into a very specific set of accounts. I think in high velocity sales, you need to watch the metrics across the entire sales cycle so closely. I think often as AEs, we look at how many discovery calls do I have, how many trials do I have, what's my ACV, what's my RAIN weight. And often, we ignore how many new meetings do I have coming up this week, what's my qualification rate. And those top of the funnel metrics are so important because I need to focus on closing my deals this week, this month, this quarter. But if I don't have enough early in my cycle, I'm gonna have a dry pipeline soon. And so I think watching those top of the funnel metrics is some days more important than the mid funnel or ended funnel. And that's why I think, especially from a leadership perspective, we can be the ones to make sure the top of the funnel is performing well and allow our reps to really focus on execute on the deals as they come in front of you. I will help make sure that the deals are getting to where they need to be. I read this book called Thinking in Bets. It was written by a professional poker player named Annie Dukes. I read this book and up for some reason, I got this just feels like an awesome sales book even though it had nothing to do with sales really. But the key concept in there is the reason that betting can be so scientific is because your feedback loop is so short. So, like, I make a bet, and then I see almost instantly if I win or not. I make a bet on an educated, you know, whatever. I can see if I won or not. And right away, you get that feedback loop that allows you to rapidly iterate. I would say high velocity sales is like that for sales. That's your place where you get immediate feedback. And so but you have to be measuring the right metrics. And Armand and I just did this big, long recording on metrics that we're releasing soon. Maybe you could take us through, like, the top two or three high level metrics that you wanna make sure that you're watching because rapid iteration means that there's stuff to learn there all the time. It's gonna depend on the time frame. But I would say, let's say, on average, on a weekly basis, my theory is I'm gonna top of the funnel, middle of funnel, and then, of course, end of the funnel. So assuming you're already watching revenue number, are you close to quota attainment? Top of the funnel, I'm watching. And, I would say for me, the most notable metric is number of sales qualified opportunities generated per week across the team plus per person, and then the mid funnel. And, usually, that's where I look at, historically, if we look at our conversion rates from stage to stage, which one for us is either the most important, because that's where we know of, like, if we get to x stage in our deal, we know we're good. For a lot of companies, as often as soon as we get the technical win, we're like, we know we're good. We have a good chance of closing the deal, or it could be the most problematic stage. So it could be we know going from discovery, getting into the trials, historically, we've just had a ton of issues because people don't have enough urgency to solve the problem or things like that. So we can always try to find one top of the funnel, which for me is number of sales qualified opportunities. Also, a great way to build a very strong partnership between SDR organizations and AD organizations since that is a shared goal, marketing included. And then I would do a mid funnel metric. And the one other thought I will say on the metrics piece is iFLOCE sales allows us in sales to actually bring the blend of art and science. Often, I see that non sales teams are focusing on this. Marketing has so much experimentation. Product management has experimentation. Engineering does. And I think historically sales, which is thought of we don't experiment. We don't think about metrics. And I think this new era, especially in high velocity sales, the more that we can marry the art and the science, the better we can do, and I think the more fun the job is. To tie off the piece on building high velocity pipe pipeline, I was working with founder the other day, and they're selling, like, 3,000, $4,000 deals. And we have an SDR who's prospecting above 10 k deals, but is also, like, finding some of these smaller deals. And he was like, why don't we just hire, like, five SDRs to, like, find these three k deals? I'm like, well, your unit economics are gonna be totally screwed. And he was like, well, then what do I do for marketing? And I was like, well, you can run paid ads. You can start doing content. You can start doing PLG because you have a trial motion. And And if I'm a sales leader listening to this, I'm wondering, like, if I wanna shake my lead tree and ask my marketing team, go find me more leads, what am I actually asking my marketing team to do? If you think back at Census or any other high velocity sales org that you've run, where did the majority of your leads come from? Like, what does that usually look like? Referrals. Word-of-mouth. Go find your most successful customers. Their networks are the ones who are gonna bring you people who can be just as successful. Obviously, it means a lot of things. That means go to conferences and events where these people are, be in the communities that they care about. A lot of these companies are champions and stakeholders, the ones who are just trying to understand how to be better at their craft. And that's where I think the consultative sales and that kind of peer to peer learning comes in. As sellers, we see hundreds and thousands and really the bird's eye view of what the best of the best are doing and what the problems that are coming up. Those learnings, we can help share with prospects who are thinking about it, and that allows us kinda meet them where they're at and when they're ready, to be able to think about a solution. We're right there also. So I think the word-of-mouth and referrals have really been the best, and that's at early stage companies. That is also at companies that are at a 100,000,000 in ARR. We've figured out a little bit about what high velocity sales are, how to think about pipeline. The next thing is, alright. Now I got the deal in my pipeline, and I'm ready to meet with them. In our intro, your first tip, I think it's a hot take. You said show product in the first meeting. I can guarantee you 50% of sales leaders right now are thumping their sales bible saying you're going to hell. So tell me, like, one of why are you demoing in the first call? That doesn't sound right. Yeah. I'm gonna say don't demo. Do a product tour. The two things are different. Demo I agree. You cannot demo a product until you have done full discovery. You truly need a tailored demo. I am a 100% in that boat. A product tour does something else. We know that, buyers are itching to see the product, and we know typically we need to do discovery to be able to unlock that. What often happens, especially in a high velocity sale when someone knows they're trying to move fast is when they're like, I just wanna see the product. And that's from a selling side. We're just saying, no. No. No. Please answer these questions, and it just it starts to do off on the wrong foot. And so the purpose of a product tour is almost the same elevator pitch that you would give in slides. Don't use slides. Almost don't yeah. Don't use slides. Instead, just show them. Have a stage demo environment where you can really curate the story that showcases the capabilities of your solution and use that almost to give your elevator pitch, which means this is still something you can do within one minute. And it's still the purpose is to kick off your discovery to be unlock a true product demo. But what it allows you to do is, one, as soon as you show your screen, often buyers get surprised, pleasantly surprised. They're like, oh, I can see the product so fast. You're giving them a glimpse of the different capabilities of it, which often I found, one, allows you to start asking discovery questions sooner than you would. Two, you can start to see the kind of prospects, reactions and feedback, and you can start to see what's picking their curiosity and what's not. And that just allows you to actually start asking questions right there. And I've also noticed it's a great and easy way to start bringing up additional use cases, and a great way to identify additional stakeholders much faster. So So if I'm talking to sales and I'm telling them, hey. I can get your sales data into from a data warehouse into your Salesforce instance, and I Marketo is also on the screen. I can also bring up we also have marketing instances or integrations like Marketo. Is there anyone on the marketing side that may be interested? Often sometimes, like, oh, actually, we should maybe go talk to Susie on the demand gen side, and that's a great person. And then for the second call, we're gonna do a fully built out demo. I'm now having additional stakeholder and potential champion to bring in. You do, like, a harbor tour where you're taking, like, the entire platform and kinda trying to condense it into five to seven minutes? Or are you taking, like, a specific use case and saying, look at how awesome we are at this. Let's see what kind of use cases that we should talk about with you. It's a good question. Closer to the second. So, like, from a time limit, it should take one to two minute. It should not be a five to seven minute thing. The way I think about it is, like, this should be almost like an elevator pitch. And so five to seven minutes is no longer an elevator pitch. And so that's where depending on the complexity of the platform and how many use cases, if there is kinda one main capability, then I can use that to show parts of the product. For example, often, like, on the navigation bar in the product, it may have tabs that we're not gonna touch on. But even the fact that someone can see that may start to bring up questions or curiosities around it. If a product does have multiple use cases, then depending on the persona I'm talking to, I'm gonna ideally have one use case story that end to end shows them, like, what would this look like for them in their role. And then, ideally, where it makes natural sense, try to also touch on, are there tangential use cases that could be relevant for them or for additional teams at their company? One time, had a demo expert come in at Outreach and train my team on experts. His name was Peter Cohen. Peter Cohen's number one thing he says is start with the best screen. And I think that's kind of what I hear you saying is is, like, let's not work through the whole work flow and finally, like, unveil after a few minutes. This is the coolness. Just take them right to the coolness and be like, have you ever wanted to see this? Here it is. You're looking at it. Right? Yeah. Now one thing that worries me with this, if somebody if let's say I'm reporting to you and you're telling me to do this for my team, I'll I'll immediately get a little red flag, which is people are gonna look around that screen, and they're gonna start asking, what's this? What's this? How's this work? How'd you get here? How do you handle that situation when people start to take over the harbor tour and drive the boat? It's a great question. So there's a couple pieces. One is because the tour is so short, often, like, if it's only taking a minute or two, you're moving through things through things pretty fast, and often it does capture people's attention. If If I'm spending too long on one page or kind of, like, one area, then, yes, I think it begs a lot more room for people to start asking questions. If someone is really digging in, I would use that to start doing discovery to be like, what about this has been piquing their curiosity so much? And my goal again as a seller is to try to get to their pain. So if you keep digging into one area, then, like, tell me why. And if that means my tour gets put on hold because we're now doing this fantastic discovery into this, hopefully, deep pain you have on this one area, I would still call that a win. And that's also where, I mean, in Mark, you mentioned earlier of, like, beauty of high velocity sales, is there's so much room for experimentation. I don't think you can have a call goal the same way every time. You have to truly understand how to be agile. You have to understand how to understand people's reactions real time and really kinda change things on the fly. But it allows you opportunities to have so many more of those at bats where I find personally find that to be much less common if you're just going to a slide deck. Well, I was gonna say this doesn't just apply to high velocity sales. Like, when I was at Cardian, it was the three k deals. If we saw a deal that was, like, a hot one call close, it was a ten ten ten discovery call flow. It's like ten minutes of discovery. It's like, do they need evaluation? Okay. Cool. It's clear there's a problem. Ten minutes of Harbour Tour. And we call it, like, an open the box demo where, like, you they they basically just want you to open the box and be like, okay. Like, the product's in there. Like, I'm not someone's not stealing something. You open the box. You show them, like, hey. Look. The shoes that you bought are in there, and then you close the box. And then you use ten minutes to actually, like, go through pricing and close the deal. That's, like, the one call close. But at both Carta and at Pave, when I was closing 50 k deals, even 100 k deals, the discovery call flow was then fifteen, five, and five. So it was, like and then a five minute agenda. So it was, like, fifteen minutes of discovery or twenty minutes discovery, five minute harbor tour. And the purpose of that harbor tour demo is to tease the next call. It's to, like, get them excited about, like it's again, it's literally like touring the harbor and just look be like, look at all these buildings. You can't go inside of them. Like, look at what's around here. You use the last five minutes to set the next steps to get them to see the rest of the stuff. But I feel like in today's age, people get extremely, extremely impatient when they can go demo products on people's websites and look up YouTube videos and all that stuff. And then there's, like, this big gate in this wall between the seller and the product. It's like a very antiquated to run way to run a sales cycle to not show the product at all on a first call unless you're selling something, like, crazy complex. Like, you're probably not gonna demo SAP on the first call, but that's because the solution is just so massive. I think the concept of give get is, like, not always on the front of a a seller's mind. But, a give get means that there's an exchange of things that are of value. And guess who gets to decide what the value is, is the person who's asking for it. So I might think a demo is just something I do, but if my buyer really wants it, then it could be a give or a get, right, for me to give them the demo. If I'm gonna give them the demo, then I get to ask something for equal or lesser value back. And to your point earlier, if I'm gonna give you a demo on the first call because you want it and it's valuable to you, I'm gonna get back discovery, and I'm gonna get back pain points. So if I'm gonna give you a demo in the beginning, I'm gonna get that technical person on the next call to do a deeper dive. And reps really need to think about this. It's not manipulative. It's just fair and how equal humans participate with each other versus most trust just wanna give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, and they're hoping at the end, like, they get the deal. Well, look, I think one other thing that comes up really commonly on the note of give gets is when people aren't willing to give in return. In velocity sales, the death of a velocity sales team or the death of a velocity seller is clinging onto the deals that are never gonna move. Because that, by definition, is not velocity selling. That is slow selling. And so when you're teaching your team to get deals on or off quickly Mhmm. What are some of the signals or some of, like, the spidey senses that you're teaching your reps to make sure that they don't cling on the bad pipeline and they can identify a hot deal or dequeue it out of their funnel as quickly as possible? Yeah. It's a great question. I think some of it comes from fear. Some of it is like, if I close this deal, the deal is done. And I think the way I would reframe that is, like, is this the right time? Are the ducks in a row that this is the deal we should be focusing on now, or is it something that we actually need to close loss for now and revisit down the road? And so this doesn't mean the deal is done forever. The deal is just not ready right now. And that could mean if you have one person and one champion who's gatekeeping you from the buyer or other people, this person this is not the right time. Either this means, like, I need to then work on trying to get to someone else, maybe, trying to go a different avenue or just understand, like, why this person gatekeeping. It could be because it's important to them, not important for anyone else right now because the pain is not strong enough, which means, like, I don't have the deal. I need to walk away from it. Or it could be something else. And so that's where I think part of it for reps to feel more comfortable. It's like, because you closed this deal right lost this deal right now, doesn't mean the deal is dead. It's dead. It's not the time right now. Let's go find a deal that is much more right for you to put your efforts on, and let's make sure we keep tracking and understand what would it take to win this deal. So if it does require nurturing from our end, we can spend our efforts there. Because I think that we've seen closed loss for engagements are some of the best deals that will ever close in such high win rates. And so the time is not now, and it's okay to say that. I think that's what the fear is is, like, I didn't do my job well enough to win the deal, and that's not true. I remember as a sales manager and as leader at Carta, I would, like, open up a rep's pipeline, and I'd see, like, 50 deals or, like, 30 deals in there. I'd be like, I don't even like, I can't deep dive all these deals. There's no way. And as a leader, you gotta be able to be like, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. Like, here's how I can quickly, like, know if this deal is, like, on its way to closing or not. So for you, like, you do a pipeline review in a high velocity sales organization. Like, what's on your pipe review checklist or the three questions you ask? Like, how do you even tear up a pipeline when it has so many deals in it? Yeah. It's a great question. I would say, I don't think there's a perfect answer. I'm still, like, trying to figure out, and I think it's different in every company. It's and I don't think there's a perfect solution. I think some of it is, like, why is this a real deal, and are we aligned on the timeline is part of it. Because I think often I find that a lot of the pieces may be there. They have a pain. We're to have the right people. They're, like, interested and they want to test it out eventually, but it's like, are we aligned that we're gonna solve this problem in the next, let's say, one month? That's often when I dig in deep. It's like there's we're not aligned there. And that's because, like, yes, they're curious, but there's not enough pain and urge did you actually drive urgency? Like, we are gonna sign now, or something else. So that's one. It's like, is this a real deal right now? And then do we truly have the elements that we need of our deal? I think it changes for somewhat different products, but, typically, it's like, do you truly have a champion that you've tested and you can actually say is, like, this is a true champion for my deal, and then other elements like technical validation. I think often something, especially in these types of deals that can be forgotten is, competition. Of course, you're gonna include competition in your discovery, but the more that you can know that upfront through the deal process, we can also kind of plant the seeds to help kind of help, make sure our product's superior throughout, without needing to then at the almost at the end of the trial, then try to convince them of why we're better than the competitor or when it comes to the pricing piece as well. So the more that we kinda understand early on and understand because we've seen these so many times getting the sheer volume of deals that we're working, The more that we can plant those seeds in the beginning is fantastic. So for example, in even a glimpse in the product tour or in the demo, being able to also highlight how do we differentiate ourselves above all of the competitors. I think just tying this one off, Malika, the two questions that you said are really, really similar to what we were doing at Carta, which is, like, in the simplest form, you need to make sure that you have problem and process locked down. And the first question you said encapsulates a lot of subquestions, but is there a problem that is worth solving in the next thirty days? And it's like, if not, then it's probably not a real velocity deal. And in MEDDPIC, if it was a bigger deal, you'd quantify the pain, make sure their metrics, but the reality is in velocity. Like, that stuff doesn't happen nearly as much. And then the second question is, like, is there a process in place to make sure that they're actually gonna go solve the problem? And sometimes, it's literally the champion has three k budget. Other times, it's like you gotta get this in front of a CFO. But if you know that there's a problem that they wanna solve in the next thirty days, and they have a process to get a signature, and you can run that across 33 k deals, that is much more than most velocity sales managers can say that they know about the deals in their pipeline. Because the reality is, like, you don't have the time to dig in for twenty minutes on one deal because that deal is gonna be gone next week. Like, you you gotta have, like, hot potato on these things. We talked about a lot of good habits when building high velocity sales work, but my guess is you've seen a lot of shit shows, for lack of a better word. What is the biggest mistake you've seen sales leaders make when they're building out a high velocity sales team? Sales motion, it is they take the traditional sales cycle and just try to move that through it as fast as possible. Not possible. You need to go to a first principal's perspective and really understand, like, what does this look like, what elements are needed, and what do we not need. So that's on the motion. On the team, also first principal's approach, but, like, what are the competencies that you need in a seller, not necessarily what just experience have they had. And that's where I think, you are do need a team that can be agile, that can experiment, that, like, truly can help understand how to keep iterating on the sales cycle because you can't keep running the same one all the time. And so someone who can really be agile and help you build process. And so that's where really understanding what are the competencies and potential you need to see in a candidate to feel like they're a good fit for the team, not just what roles have they been in. So, like, have you been amazing at something? It could be a job in a totally different career. Some of my best sales reps are the ones who come from the finance world, for example, or even recruiters would make some of the best sales reps. And so I think in general, high velocity sales motions means rethink the status quo. It gives you the opportunity to do that. Breaking the rules. Malika, amazing show. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Mark. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Malika. What do you have for your two? Two by two, number one, is think that you can have a product story, which is not a demo, in your first call in order to create, a momentum in a give get situation so that you can actually speed up your deal cycles. People want to see the product. The longer we make them wait, the more frustrated they get. This is a great way to show product to get something out of that first meeting that accelerates the deal. The second is I really liked how Malika broke down her metrics. She said there is a top of funnel, a mid funnel, and a bottom funnel key metric in high velocity deals that you must watch like a hawk. And I think that understanding that for high velocity, you're gonna get rapid iteration. You need to make sure that you understand what those three key metrics are and keep an eye on them. Number three. When you're building out a high velocity sales motion, you can't just take your same sales motion and be like, great. I'm gonna do the five calls in five days. You have to rethink from first principles. What are the decisions and milestones that your prospect needs to go through, and what is the most efficient way to get them through those milestones. So, for example, if, like, your AEs are doing the exact same harbor tour demo and your prospects are asking the exact same questions on every single first discovery call, you might choose to surface a product demo or an initial trial as the first point in your go to market motion so that your AEs can just focus on closing those deals fast. So that's number three. And then lastly, number four is the two question pipeline review. You do not have time to run MEDDPIC on every single deal in a high velocity sales motion. And so Malika talked about a question to make sure that there's a problem we're solving, and then she also talked about a question to make sure that there is a process in place to get this deal done. Alrighty, Mark. So if you liked this one, step one of building out a high velocity sales motion is building out your sales process. And so we wrote a piece that Mark actually inspired on the five stage sales process. And five stage does not mean five calls. Five stage means the five decisions or things you need to get in order for a signature to happen. So step one is mapping out those five things, and then step two is figuring out how can you do those things in as few interactions as possible. Go check out that newsletter down in the show notes, and folks, we'll see you on the next one.
