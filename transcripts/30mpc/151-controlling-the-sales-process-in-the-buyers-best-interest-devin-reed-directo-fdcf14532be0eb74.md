## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Segielski. And today, for round two, we have the one and only mister Devin Reid. He's over at Clari. He's running content marketing. Nick, why should people listen? Devin does a phenomenal job controlling the sale and the way that the buyer goes through their evaluation of your thing, but doing it in a way that everything he does is in the buyer's best interest and framed in the buyer's best interest. So if you wanna understand how to get the buyer to follow you in navigating the buying journey, Devin does a really good job articulating how to articulate that to the customer. And if you're having trouble closing a lead, a three, a two, a one, here is Devin Reed. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Devin. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. First is the left out question. So most sellers, when they wanna get to the decision maker, they ask, so, Arman, who's the decision maker? And that irritates and, at worst, pisses off your champion or point of contact because it feels like you're trying to go over their head. So instead, what you wanna do is use this question to surface stakeholders at any point of the sales process. So we're just gonna ask, hey, Hermon, who would feel left out if they missed the demo? Boom. What's number two? Number two is guide the process with typically. Everybody wants to be, move from a sales rep to the trusted adviser. This is one of the best ways to do it. So because there's safety with numbers, this phrasing typically signals that you're guiding them down a common and proven path, plus that you've done this before. But tone is super important. You have to make it confident. You can't hit the high pitched. Typically, we no. That's not gonna work. It has to be. So, Arman, typically, what we do next is and you roll right into whatever that next step is. Nice. Devin, typically, now we would move to tip number three, so round us out. Alright. Tip number three is don't create ROI calculations and present them as truth. Because here's why. They're extremely biased, and anyone that's been around the block once or twice, especially any CFO, is gonna know this. Because if you think about it, every single time that a sales rep completes an ROI calculator, it always benefits them. You never punch one in, finish it, and go, oh, actually, miss prospect, ROI is terrible. You should not do business with us. So for that reason, they don't work. So there's four things you should do instead. First, cocreate your ROI calculation with your champion and then again with the CFO. Two, lead with hard ROI, AKA cost savings. Third, focus on time to value, which is how quickly they'll get some return on their investment often by measuring change management. And then the fourth one is make time savings and productivity gains the sweetener, not the core value. So, typically, at the end of a sales call, Devin, you wouldn't just pepper someone with discovery questions and then jump off the call and hope that they buy the thing. You would normally leave five to ten minutes at the end of a call to cover next steps. Can you talk about how you're using typically language, or really how do you use the last five to ten minutes after a discovery call, assuming it's gone well, to continue driving the sales cycle forward? Yeah. Absolutely. So the thing is most buyers don't really know how to buy. Maybe what? We've also like, 25% are actually really skilled and kinda know what's coming next. So you wanna use that typically language to guide them and say, hey. Here's what's next in the process. This is what everybody does. When they go to buy this thing, people just like you, here's what they do. And so I just lead right into it from there. So, hey, Armand. We just wrapped this up. Typically, the next step is, I don't know, you know, a group demo with the team you just mentioned or whatever it is for your sales process. So I roll it in that way, and I map it out step by step. Don't stack it all up. Like, then we're gonna do this, then we're gonna do this, then we're gonna do this. By the third thing you list, the second thing has already forgotten. So list one thing at a time, pause. Devin, one thing that I've been struggling with recently is sometimes there's a lot of complexity with my deals, and there's multiple concurrent steps. And sometimes I legitimately don't know what the next sequential thing, like, must be. Do you have any advice for me if I'm like, should it be this? Should it be that? What should I be saying at the end if I'm not totally sure? Are you using mutual action plans? The reason why I ask is that's usually the best place, and you can start, in that last five to ten minutes, pull one up even if it's a rough template and start mapping it out together. Because here's the thing, a sales rep, you're leading, but you're not creating plans in a vacuum. And, there's actually a lot of research that shows that people will be more bought in. They will follow through more often if you co create a plan together because they will feel that they contributed to this plan. Therefore, they have ownership. Therefore, they are responsible, and they will be accountable to actually doing it. So you can pull up that mutual action plan. Just start throwing puzzle pieces down. That's what I say. I don't know if they're in the right order. I don't know if this is a corner, an edge, a middle piece, but we're just gonna throw it all down. Then you go back to your process. Hey. Which one of these do you think should we should do first? And if it's a bad idea, then call it out and say, okay. That might you know, like, you you just workshop it together for the next few minutes. Then by the end, you have a mutual action plan that was cocreated, and you both are, like, feel really good about. And so you can just follow the steps from there. Devin, how do you think about how many steps you lay out and which ones are most important to get alignment on? The reason that I ask is you say, say this would be the next step, pause, the next step, pause. My guess is you don't do every single step for ten minutes all the way through contract signature. So how far down do you lead your prospect in the sales process? Look at your feet and then look at the horizon. So what's right in front of you that we have to do next and what's the next thing over the horizon that you can still see? If you start going over that, I can no longer imagine it as easily. I can't see it in my mind's eye. And it also starts to stack. Like, we're stacking. It's like, oh, shit. This feels like work. There's a lot going on. People can get resistant. So I would say, like, probably only three steps max. And if you're sharing a mutual action plan, if there's already prebuilt steps in, the only thing I would make sure is in there are the what could be the confrontational or the highly contentious things like talk to your CFO. Include business leader or stakeholder VP, whatever you wanna language you wanna use. Because what that does, even if you don't say anything, as soon as you show words on the screen, what do people do? Start reading them. And you're priming them early that, oh, typically, Nick, when he's selling this thing, talks to these people. You don't even have to address it yet because it's probably too premature, especially if you're in that, like, discovery phase. Well, what happens when you we call this next next steps at times. In other words, you're what you almost wanna do is you wanna know what you're gonna ask for at the end of the next meeting and tee that up today. So it's not a surprise. Right? Right. And then what you get them to do is by opting into the next meeting, they are implicitly opting in that Yeah. If that meeting goes well, I'm aligned with where this thing is going. And so oftentimes the best time to seed the ask for power is at the end of a killer discovery call and take it off the table where you say, look, typically a next step from here would be we would go through a deep dive demo. We would walk you through how this thing works. And if that goes well, we would oftentimes get in front of your VP of sales. Right? But first, we wanna make sure you're on board. Does that sound like a plan? So you've almost soft floated the ask to power, and you've let it sit for a second while you're on good terms with them instead of getting to the end of the demo and being like, surprise. Now I wanna see your boss. Right? Yeah. Well, I wanna ask you about when the prospect struggles with the puzzle, and I'm I'm specifically referring to the sort of multithreading component, where one of your takeaways in the beginning was, hey. You asked the question, who else would feel left out? And the intent there is start is to start to multithread with teammates of theirs who can make a valuable contribution to the sale. What do you do when they say, you know, Armand, our, you know, our intern who just started a week ago and, you know, they're gonna be fired next week. They're only here weekly. What do you do if they suggest someone I'm sorry. I'm ripping on you, Armand. What do you do if they suggest someone who's, like, shouldn't be involved in that sale and you know it? Yeah. That that's a really good question because last thing you want is 12 either 21 on one calls that you shouldn't have or a group group call that's gonna go, go off, off to right field. So, the first thing I do is validate because you don't just ask them who would feel left out. If they say the intern and you say no, you're losing credibility and trust pretty quickly. So I validate. It's like, oh, it sounds great. Sounds like the intern's really important. Can you help me understand how in the last time you bought something that this person contributed? One of two things happens. Somehow, the intern was super important and now you know, or they'll kind of realize, oh, well, you know, you know, Doug, you know, he's he's sat in on a couple calls, but, you know, he's not really the one who, like, decides anything. Oh, okay. Cool. Well, hey. It sounds like Doug is happy to listen, or I can even send him the recording afterwards. But who else would you say would feel left out? And you're not trying to get one person. You're trying to get the roster. Right? And you don't need to get if it's 10 people and you're doing complex sales, obviously, don't try to get everybody at once. What you're really trying to do is who definitely needs to be involved in the next step, Armand, to your point, or the next next step. Right? And try to figure that out. So I think you can kind of flip it and go, like, who's involved in the last decision or how did the last, you know, decision get made? And you can start to figure out who those folks are, and then you loop in that typically language with your next next step, and you fill in the blanks with actual people versus, like, head of whatever department you're selling to. I love this concept of building the roster of who will be important in a purchasing decision. Let's say even if we're in, like, an upper mid market or, like, a lower enterprise sale, that roster might be five plus people. And you said you don't wanna shock on them all at once. Can you talk about how you carve that roster up and how you decide who you should be getting in front of first? Yeah. So I think the first thing is to I wanna say ignore titles for a second. Maybe postpone them because you know what I mean. I'm a director at a 1,000 person series f or whatever alphabet letter we're at. So we're pretty mature. We're not a start up, but we're a pretty, you know, decent sized tech company. I have a lot of purchasing power in terms of finding out what I want, why I want it, deciding the vendor, and negotiating price all by myself. My boss, specifically a VP, does not want to be involved and trust me to make those decisions. But a lot of reps would be like, well, you're I'm at the director level, but I'm not at the VP. I'm not at the VP. And so I think you can make some, less calculated, assumptions that I have to get to the VP. You do, but for what reason? It's not for vendor selection. Right? And so I think the point is, like, who is involved in the decision and what are their roles? And then if you turn me, the director, into a champion, I have a budget so you can have some. I'll tell you what it is if you've earned that right. I'll take you to the VP if I think it's necessary, but I'll also tell you, which I told Nick, I'm gonna skip the VP, and I'm gonna take you somewhere else because I actually know that's the way to get things done here. Right? And so I think too that's why it's important to have built up that trust and use some of the techniques we've been talking about where you're not, you know, ramming your way through the front door to get a deal done, but you're, like, on the same side of the table with your champion, and you're uncovering and problem solving and mapping this out together. So, Devin, let's assume that you've carved up your roster, and you did what the right thing to do, which is you set up this next step. And that next step might include other people who are at or slightly above the line. Maybe it does include the head head honcho. Right? And this person goes offline. And as they bring that group together, before the call, they say, hey. One of the things that the group asked me to do is get a sense of how much this costs ahead of our call. I know you have some interesting tactics behind how you deliver pricing over a call and also what happens if you don't get a clear response there. Can you talk about how I would handle an ask like that when it's off of a call and they're asking me for commercial terms when I don't necessarily wanna give them? So I'll do something probably counterintuitive, which is one, I'm not gonna give pricing, but I'm going to do it in a way that's, probably abnormal, which is I'm gonna claim confusion. I'm going to say, oh, Armand, I would love to. I genuinely have no idea what I would price you because we're not even close to scoping out the impact that we can have and who all would be involved. So maybe we go through this demo as we planned, scope it out a little bit more, and and either by the end of that or the next call, I mean, you can sync up, really figure this thing out, and give you a more precise price point instead of a, you know, $50,000 pricing band. That doesn't really help answer your question. Two things that that I think about in this situation. One is I think a lot of salespeople sell, and they they think about their identity as a salesperson where because they've done all this product training and sales training, they have to come across as, like, an extremely smart and competent professional. And sometimes when you're you almost play the opposite of that where you're a little bit confused. You're a little bit, like, slow to catch up. You're you're asking them for clarification. I don't even know where to start with this pricing. It feels weird for your, like, self identity and ego to say that. But in reality, it's the best thing for the sale. And what you're not doing here is trying to be deceptive or hurt the customer. Like, you genuinely want to know more about their situation to give them an accurate quote. And if they push you, you could probably give them a range. But the intent here is to not, be the person who's so quick to give them an answer because you could probably go spend fifteen hours searching in your CRM for a similar customer and give them a quote, and that's not the intent. You're trying to actually have a real conversation. So let's go to you've done the demo. You've given them some pricing. They've got a proposal, and you're they're supposed to be on the calendar for a next step. But for whatever reason, they missed that meeting, and now you're on to email only. And you haven't heard back from them. You were talking about this interesting law called Cunningham Law and how you use it to follow-up. Can you talk to me about what that looks like? Yes. I love all things that are like Internet phenomena, which is what this is. So Cunningham's law is the idea that you are more likely to get an accurate, answer from the Internet if you propose the wrong answer instead of asking for the right answer. So instead of asking a question, like, you might get crickets. But if you propose the wrong answer or an incomplete answer, the Internet will swarm in, tell you you're right, wrong, ugly, and all the things in between, and you will get an answer. And so I caught wind of this and thought it was fascinating. And so I said, what if you could try that in sales? And so what I'll do is I'll use this into a follow-up email. Right? So for example, you know, hey, Nick. You know, typically, when I don't hear back after sharing pricing, it's usually because of one of these reasons. One, pricing doesn't fit your budget, and you're too nice to tell me. Two, life happened, and you're simply busy. Or three, this project got deprioritized, so pricing doesn't make sense right now. Let me know if it's one of these or something else. All good either way. Very passive. I'm not I'm not demanding an answer. I'm not being cute. I'm providing either three easy to choose options that are very possibly accurate or leaving the door open to well, back to confusion. I don't know everything, so you tell me. And, I've tested this out, like I said, in a small batch with my consulting, and I genuinely get a 100% reply rate within twenty four hours. And it's always with additional context that isn't on my email. So people say, oh, no, Devin. It's none of that. I got COVID last week. I've been out for seven days. Haven't looked at a computer. Still on track. Let's talk in two days or something like that. Love that. And so let's say I finally get the response from the champion that I needed. We get onto a call, and, really, the next step in the sales cycle is this proposal call. Right? So for the sake of right now, let's assume that we've delivered price. And this is something that we know sellers are struggling with a ton is deals are getting axed left and right by finance. And what it sounds like is, okay. I need to go run this by my CFO, or I need to go and make a proposal to finance. So when I hear those things from my champion in that pricing conversation, What do I do in that moment in time? So this is where you turn on extreme curiosity, and you need to map out anything and everything that could happen on that call. So I think the first bridge is or the first fork in the road is, am I gonna be in that meeting, or am I not gonna be in that meeting? And so you can lead with that or not. But I think the way I would probably start is, like, alright. Cool. Like, first, like, validate that you just, you know, got this person say this proposal looks good. Yeah. Awesome. Really excited about this with you. So when you go to take this to your VP, like what's that conversation look like? Super open ended, genuine curiosity in my tone, and I'm trying to figure out how this person is going to go about selling it internally. Now the things I actually listen for a lot are the tone of that person's response. If they're like, Nick, not a problem. I know there's you know, my voice even got deeper. I know there's $300,000 in budget. We're gonna get this thing done. I've done it blah blah blah blah blah. Probably, like, leaning towards confidence. If it's like, you know, Nick, my one on one's next Thursday. And so, yeah, I'll probably bring it up then. That is, like, 10 yellow, maybe red flags. Like, you need to get involved. And so, you can go into it and and basically doing discovery of what that call will look like and start to understand and ask what could go wrong. What does this person care about? What do they not care about? What was the last thing that they approved? What was the last thing that they didn't approve? Why? Obviously, you're not gonna fire these off all in a row the way I am, but you need to start figuring that out. And then the way I do it is is an offer. I don't demand to be in that meeting. I offer it. Hey. It sounds like you got it pretty covered, but I've been selling this thing for three years, and I know we just met four weeks ago. Would it be helpful just to have me in that call? I'll be a fly on the wall until you call on me, but I'd love to be there just to support you. However you wanna word it, do it for your own style. I would say $50.50 if people go, yeah. I'd love to have you there. Actually, not a problem. Or, no. I'm not comfortable. And if they say you're they're not comfortable, you should ask why. And I don't mean you ran through and make sure you're in the meeting, but you should understand, like, someone saying they're not comfortable is a is a big flag. So it sounds like you're coaching that person through almost asking them about how how the meeting's gonna go and having them envision being in that meeting so that they've had a a practice run. So when the real thing happens, they're a bit more equipped. Armand, it sounds like your team might be actually pushing to get face to face with finance. Can you can you tell me about that? Yeah. What I wanna do is tie together two things that Devin has done throughout the interview that may or may not have even been intentional tactics. So I wanna go all the way back to the intern example, right, where he didn't wanna get introduced to the lowly intern Nick. Neither would I. I wouldn't even wanna talk to him if he was the VP of sales. But the way that he got out of that ask was he asked questions. He didn't say no. That's not the right person. He asked questions that led them to realize they didn't have the right answer. He said Yep. How has that person influenced a buying decision before? Right? And what Devon is doing is with finance, he's doing the exact same thing, and he's trying to understand with curiosity, how are you gonna handle that conversation? Have you had a conversation like this before? What are you gonna do when they push back? And then what you can do is when the person doesn't have the answers to those questions, you can say, hey. Let me help you. Right? I wanna make sure that I can help you solve this problem. And that's exactly the same way that I I like to approach it is if you just ask to be put in front of finance, right, they're gonna get defensive about it. Right? But if you make it clear that you have the keys to the car that will help them there through questions, that's how you get in front of finance the right way. Yeah. Absolutely. Yes. Self realization. You know what I mean? Letting them come to the conclusion of, oh, I'm not as ready as maybe I should be. Well said. So can we talk about, Devin let's assume in the best case scenario, we are about to get in front of finance. K? So I have a champion who is now in agreement that you and I are gonna go together in front of your CFO. What do I do to prepare for that conversation, and how should I be running that call with a CFO who may or may not know what I do at all? So I think the first thing not to do is just assume you're a business expert on their behalf. You you'll you'll never know. You'll never know more than they do, and I think that's okay. And so one of the mistakes I think is going in to be, you know, Nick, I saw this from you, to be approved, not improved. So, like, hey. Here's this thing. I built it. I did it. My goal is just to get you to stamp it. I don't really wanna hear anything. I just want you to stamp it. That almost never happens, and that's because that is literally the job of a CFO or procurement is to protect the business. And they're never gonna trust an outside salesperson to have the best interest of their business in mind top down. So go into it. Again, extreme curiosity. Reconfirm all of the value and the business case that you've created. Mention as many people in your organization that you've actually worked with to show, like, hey. I I've got I went wide here. Right? It's gonna build trust and credibility. And then ask for their input. My goal for this meeting is to get your input. I want your fingerprints on what we talk about today. You've just opened up the door. And when you walk into that meeting, it's I'm assuming it's you, your champion, CFO, and maybe a couple other finance folks from their side. What does the sort of balance of running the meeting look like between you and your champion? Are you taking the charge right away? Are you asking them to kick the meeting off? What does that look like? I would enable and empower your champion to do as much talking and selling as possible. It's your CFO works with them, trusts them, and they're looking for competency. They're saying, does this, you know, does director VP coming to me asking for budget knowing the environment we're in right now, do they really know why they're making this decision? Can they really articulate the impact? Because if they can't, sales rep's only gonna be here for a couple more weeks. Yeah. As soon as it's signed, they're gone. You're gonna get a CSM, but we all know you know, we all get CSMs, whatever. So I would lean on them as much as possible, and only come in to supplement where necessary. If you've done your job leading to this call, you shouldn't have to talk much. I mean, this is a theme that you've brought up again and again and again. Everything that you are doing is coming from the standpoint of it is in the best interest of the other person who would feel left out if they didn't see the demo. This is why you're signing by X date because of this problem you're trying to solve that has an urgency attached to it, making them look good in front of the CFO. Everything here is designed to keep the other person's best interest in mind, which makes them take the action that you're asking them to take. The action I'm gonna ask you to take is we're running out of time, and so we've gotta move to the final question, Devin. The last question is this. We've talked about a lot of really good things salespeople should be doing. We're gonna ask you now about a shouldn't. And so the last question is what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Yes. And, having been a salesperson for six, seven years, I've done what I'm about to say to stop doing, so I'm not finger wagging. But so now that I'm, you know, director level marketing, I get hit up all the time for prospecting. I'm in a million cadences for for some reps at any given time. The thing that I see happen almost every morning when I check my inbox is, hey, Devin. You never responded to my email. Drives me crazy. And the reason why you should stop doing it, not just because it drives Devin Reed crazy, is because you are projecting guilt. That is the emotion you're projecting. Hey. You didn't do this thing that I wanted you to do. Guess what? I never said I would. I don't even know you. So that doesn't really do anything except for one, remind me that I already decided previously not to reply to you, or two, to make it really easy to delete. Soon as I see that email, I just delete it or I look for the unsubscribe button. So that's what not to do. Don't lead with guilt, however you wanna word that. If you're looking for a fix, cut it. Just cut it and get right to the point. That's the easiest thing. Or you we can go over a whole new episode on, you know, hooks, triggers, and ways to get people to respond over email. Boom. Devin, thank you so much for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this.

That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Devon Reed include, number one, at the end of the call, use typically language to not just set the next steps, but the next next steps that are at your feet and at your horizon of the deal. Number two, if someone suggests the wrong person to multithread to, don't just tell them they are wrong. Ask how that person was involved in past purchases, and they'll usually figure out that it's probably not the right person to loop in. Number three, when your champion is proposing to finance, first, you need to figure out if you are going to be in that room. If you are not, then you need to ask them questions about how that conversation will go and what could go wrong so you can prepare them for that conversation. And lastly, number four, the reason that you drive timeline cannot just be your discount. It needs to be the biggest thing that you've learned that is in their interest, not just in your interest. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? There is a lot of really crappy sales advice on LinkedIn, but it doesn't come from Devon Reed. Devon actually does a really good job, on LinkedIn sharing written best practices of stuff that he's learned, at a bunch of pretty high high growth tech companies. So my recommendation for you all is connect with Devin. Let him know that you heard about him on the thirty minutes to presidents club podcast. And if you enjoyed this episode, let him know that also. Thanks for listening. We'll see you all next week.
