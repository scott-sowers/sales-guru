## Transcript

Good morning, everybody. And welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Croak. I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski. And we have one of the most requested playbooks ever. It's how to run a discovery call. This is probably, guys, the hardest part to sell them. So if you get through these thirty and you're feeling pretty good, awesome. If you're feeling a little bit tough, listen to it again. But if you master this, you're gonna be a killer seller. Nick, why should people listen? Well, Arman and I normally are able to do our playbooks in one take, maybe two if we're lucky. We've we spent, like, six or seven hours on this thing, man. I mean, this is a really complex topic, but I think we've made a decent episode. And it's a three, a two, a one, a tank two. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a skill forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. So okay. Let's start with the discovery philosophies. Before you even get into the blocking and tackling of how to run a good discovery call or discovery process, you have to understand the the mindset behind it, Arman. That's one of our favorite topics. So the first thing that I always think about on a discovery call is it's gotta be a conversation. The last thing that you wanna do is take any specific individual tactic and, like, pull it out of your pocket on a call because it just is awkward. Your goal is to have a conversation. Number two, way too many people get stuck in the clicks and the spreadsheet and the process. And if you keep hearing things like it takes a lot of time or we're on spreadsheet or we do it this way or we do it that way, that means you're stuck in process problems and technical problem. And so number two is you need to get the technical problems. You need to understand the situation quickly and then get off of that and get them talking about business problems and impact. Alright. So the last philosophy is we always talk about being disarmingly blunt. But here's the deal. On a discovery call, there's no reason to hide stuff like price or, where you're not so strong. We believe you should be sharing weaknesses that you have. If the customer says, hey. We're struggling with x and you can't help with x, you probably wanna tell them. Because if they're not a good fit, it's gonna come out in the wash eventually. You better off just be transparent, share it, and then move on. So if the call is not going well also, I like to call that stuff out. So if Arman's giving me a bunch of one word answers, I might say, Arman, I feel a little awkward saying this, but I feel like this call is not really going so hot. Am I totally off base with that? And this brings us to the most awkward part of most discovery calls, the first five minutes. Bonding and rapport. Here's the deal. Nick should really be taking this section because I hate building rapport. I'm naturally introverted. He's naturally extroverted. However, you have to be able to flex into it a little bit. Not every person is going to, be okay with you just taking off the sales call right away. Give a little bit of flow with them. But here's the thing. You need to do it quickly, and you need to do it in a way that is not talking about the weather. You need to do it in a way that shows that you did your research. So within those first few minutes, take what you know about them, about their company, and bring that up in the first one hundred twenty seconds of the call, and that will set the tone for the rest of the call. Because now they'll be like, oh, this person looked on my LinkedIn. For example, if I'm jumping on a call with Nick, in the first few minutes, I might say like, hey. How'd you get started at USC wrestling? And he knows I've looked him up on LinkedIn now, and that will set the tone that he respects me because I have respected him. But Then you need to quickly get off it and then go to step two, which is actually setting the agenda. Right. So now you roll into the meeting logistics and what some people call the upfront contract. There's a couple things that you gotta nail right in the beginning of the meeting when you roll into the business side of things. You gotta make sure that you're good on time. You've gotta get permission to ask some questions. You can't just roll right into your interrogation doctor's checkup. And then you've gotta talk a little bit about logistics related to next steps in the beginning of the call. For me, it sounds something like, Arman, I had us down for thirty minutes here. I think that puts us at a hard stop at 04:00. That cool with you? Or you gotta stop sooner. Arman says, great. Alright. Cool. I have a bunch of questions that I put together after I was doing some research on your company. I I hope it's okay if I ask you a couple of them today. Arman says, yes. You can ask me questions. And then I say something like, Arman, look. Typically, these introductory calls end up going one or two ways. We're probably gonna have a conversation here, and you might decide at the end of today's call that we're not gonna be able to help you. And if that's the case, totally fine. Won't hurt my feelings. We'll just go our separate ways. No harm. No foul. The other outcome might be you think, alright. This sounds kinda interesting, and Nick's company might be able to help me, but I need to do some more due diligence and see a demo of this thing to see for myself. If that's the case, you know, we'd happy to set a demo with you. I guess given that we have a hard stop in half an hour, are you cool stopping about five minutes early so we can talk about whether or not we move to that next step? Armand says yes, and boom. Now I've got commitment from Armand to talk about next steps at the end of the call. So you never end in deal purgatory where you've got no next step on the books. So we've set the expectation that we're gonna start with discovery before we get into demo. And the first question you gotta ask is not tell me about your priorities or this or that, but our favorite first question is just understanding why the heck did you take the call. Because if you go shoot, dump in deep to, like, super detailed discovery questions right off the bat, oftentimes, people are gonna feel like, hey. Like, don't you at least wanna know why I'm here in the first place? And so start with why they took the call. Oftentimes, they'll bring you right to the problem. But here's the thing. If they don't, if they say, oh, my boss told me to take the call, do not take this at face value. If they don't give you a real reason why they took the call, you need to ask again and say something along the lines of, well, I'm sure your boss has something in mind, or I'm sure you don't take every call that comes your way. Like, what prompted you to jump on this call? Like, what do you wanna get? Armand, the other reason that you do that is you want the other person to feel like you actually care about them and their agenda because they might just say, well, the reason I'm here is I'm looking for a solution for better task management. And if you can't help with, like, the thing that they're coming in blazing hot with, like, tell them you can't help and then go save yourself twenty seven minutes and make some cold calls or something. So let them know you actually care about them. Let them lay their agenda out first because they might say things that you were gonna ask about anyway, and you get them from them right up front. That's how you get them talking. Exactly right. And if you find that the type of person that's jumped on the call is one who knows zero about your business or is completely in the dark as to what problem they're trying to solve, oftentimes, you can ask them, hey. Would it be helpful if I gave you, like, a thirty second overview of what we do here at thirty MPC? They'll say yes. Give them your quick elevator pitch just so they have enough so they understand where the future questions are going to come from. If they already know what you do, you can go right into this thing. And that brings us to phase number two where we're actually in the discovery mall. Right. So the idea here is you're trying to quickly grasp the situation at hand. Why are they here? What's the problem that they're looking to solve? Your goal is to understand the logistics. You know, we talked about earlier. You don't wanna get stuck in the roles and permissions and the clicks and the spreadsheets, but you do need to understand those things very quickly because that's how you're gonna show them how you help. But you don't wanna spend the entire discovery call talking about every little nuance of their workflow. Your goal is to quickly understand that problem and then move to understanding the implications of that problem. So if they're telling you that they're struggling today and they needed more efficient solution to edit the podcast, okay, You need to spend a little bit of time understanding how they're editing the podcast, what that process looks like, but quickly then move to, well, why is that even important? What are you trying to do with that time that you're wasting editing a podcast right now? Exactly. And if you're going into demo checklist questions or doctor's checklist questions in discovery, that means you are not doing a good discovery. And so I need a minimum viable amount of information to do proper discovery if I'm selling a podcast editing service. It's probably something along the lines of how are you editing your podcast today? Are you doing it yourself? Are you doing it with somebody else? And what are the problems with the way you're doing it today? And then I can jump off the situation. I don't care what type of mic they're using. I don't care if they're using Zoom or whatever other crazy squad cast situation they got going on. I just care about how they're doing this stuff today, and then you wanna get on to why that matters immediately. And this is where level one sellers tend to get to that, is they can usually grasp the situation, and they can usually get to surface level problems. Surface level problems sound like I'm spending a lot of time editing, or it takes us a while to ship our episodes, or it's a little bit annoying to deal with our current editors today. But those don't tell me about the true impact on thirty MPC as a business. And so, Nick, what would impact on thirty MPC as a business sound if you were selling me podcast editing software? So what I'm trying to do here is get the prospective customer to share big issues that came as a result of them not having an efficient enough solution. If somebody tells you we need something that's more user friendly and more efficient, uh-uh. That's not it. But when I get Armond to share with me that they lost a sponsor on the show because they couldn't ship an episode in time and it screwed up the publishing schedule, that's bad. That's lost revenue for Arman, and he's worried about that. My goal is to understand, wow, Arman lost a sponsor because he doesn't have a good enough editing solution. And if I can tie my solution to keeping that sponsor, I'm in the money. And I set myself apart from all the other competitors out there. Now there's a couple really clever questions or or types of questions, Armand, that you and I thought about that can raise those big issues and understand the impact. Exactly right. And but here's the thing is before we jump into how to ask these questions, there are many ways to not ask these questions. And so some ways to not ask these quote, unquote impact questions, which I hate calling them that, but they are impact questions. Or if I ask you one very directly offensive questions and so, Nick, if I did ask you, well, have you lost any sponsors because you haven't shipped any episodes? That is a very direct leading antagonistic type of question. Do not ask those. The other ones are the obnoxious ones that are extremely leading and cringy. And what they sound like would be, Nick, what would you do with all that time back in your calendar if you didn't have to edit those podcast episodes? Could you tell me a little bit about that? Every single person, all 30,000 listeners this month, all unanimously cringed when I asked that question, and sellers ask these questions every single day. Well, what if we do a little bit of role play and we pretend it's Harry Potter and I say, well, Armand, if I had a magic wand and I could wave it around and flick it at you, what magic solution would you like to spawn? Like, please stop asking crap like that. It's so cheesy. Instead, do something like a humbling disclaimer question where you might say like, Arman, I feel a little bit awkward asking you this, but I've heard this from other podcast hosts before where they've struggled with their editing and it's caused them to not be able to get episodes out in time, and they've had issues with sponsors being upset with them. I can't imagine that's something that's happened with your team, though. You wanna break down what I did there? What you're doing is this is from Charles Mulbauer, one of the best discovery episodes we had all the time, where I'm just calling out the fact that I'm gonna ask you about something that's a little bit uncomfortable. And it's sorta like when you go to your mom and you're like, mom, I really screwed this one up today. Mom's, like, expecting the worst. And then when the question or the statement actually lands, it's not that bad. And that's what Nick is doing is he's taking all that brain trash, that awkwardness that everyone else is afraid to call out, and they just live in it. And what he's doing is he's calling it out, putting it on the table, and asking the question. And then the customers are like, no. That's not an unreasonable question to be asking. And that's how you do a humbling disclaimer. The other thing that I've seen you do really, really well, Armand, is you get the customer to tell a story about their issue, and you do that by asking when was the time that you realized this was a problem. I love that question because what it does is it forces them to tell about a specific moment in time. And I've I've always heard stories sell. Like, stories are attached to emotion, and it's actually great when you can get the customer to share a story of their issue with you. Exactly. Anytime you hear something where someone's requesting podcast editing services, for example. Yep. You can get to the surface level problem of, like, hey. It's taken a lot of time. But once you get stuck there, you should be asking them questions like, hey. Like, my guess is, like, there was a point where it was like, okay. Now we need to actually consider a podcast editor. What was that point in time? And they're not going to say July 27 at 07:47PM. They're going to describe the moment where when was the last straw that broke the camel's back. And that's what you're looking for. So keep in mind, the surface level problems can oftentimes be described very pragmatically. It takes up a lot of time to edit podcasts. But the emotional business impact problems are almost always attached to a story where it's I spent three hours at 3AM editing this stupid podcast, and all the ums and ahs were still in there, and it was a nightmare. And then one of our amazing sponsors, Acme Inc, ended up dropping us because we missed the episode. That's a story, and that's attached to business outcome. Now when you get a customer to start sharing that stuff with you, the worst thing you can possibly do is turn this whole thing into an interrogation. What you want to do is get them talking artfully. And one of the best ways you can do that is with what is called a label. Now Arman just shared this horrible story of being up at 3AM editing the show. What novice sellers are gonna do is move on to the next question and start asking about mic integrations because they that's what they need to show the demo. What the best sellers are gonna do is they're gonna say, jeez, Armand. That sounds like it was a really brutal process. All I'm doing is I'm labeling my reaction to the story that Arman just told me. I wasn't asking another question. I was saying, here's what I heard from you. That that's called empathy. But what that also does is that prompts Arman to continue talking. Remember, your job on the discovery call is to discover, and you don't discover anything when you're the one talking. You discover when the other person is talking. So you can do a label. You can do also what's called a a playback where Arman just given me this whole brain dump. And what I'm going to do is I'm gonna summarize in a couple sentences what Armand just told me. Well, okay, Armand. I just wanna make sure that I got this right. It sounds to me like you're using x y z service right now, and you're running your podcast through a transcription service. But, part of what's frustrating you is you've got to manually remove the umms and the ahs. And it sounds like that's one of the bigger issues that you have going on. Did I get all of that right, or did I miss anything? Awesome opportunity to get Armand to continue talking. And the last piece here is that the the biggest point of feedback that I have to people when I do mock disco interviews is not that they're not asking me enough questions. It's that they're asking me so many questions that I feel interrogated. And by the end of it, I have no clue what you do, or I feel like you haven't listened to me at all. And that's when you tend to hear questions like, am I gonna get into a demo or not? And that's because you're usually interrogating your buyers. And so it's important where, typically, most solutions have two or three buckets of problems you can help with. When you do discovery deep in one bucket, for example, it might be podcast editing is one bucket, podcast subtitling is another bucket. When you're done with the podcast editing bucket, give them a taste of how you've helped other customers before you move on to the next bucket. So that might be ten, fifteen minutes in. And don't give them everything, but you can say things like, yeah. We see this all the time with other customers like x, y, and z. They were facing a, b, and c type of problem just like you guys. Directly, I'm gonna mark this down so we cover it in the demo, but we're gonna help you by doing e, f, and g. Right? Boom. Moving on. Tell them a quick story or tell them a quick anecdote that social proves that you've solved this problem before, but then don't get super deep into the weeds. Save that after the demo later on. Yeah. One of the ways that you can do that, Arman, by demonstrating that social proof is if somebody shares a problem and you know that that is probably leading to another problem is by asking a really intelligent question where it's like, oh, well, it's really interesting that you're dealing with that. Typically, when I talk to folks who are dealing with x, they're also dealing with y. I think we can help you with both. Is y something you guys are dealing with today or or not really at all? What I'm doing here is I'm showing I I actually know what the heck's going on in this space. I love what you did in that example you shared where you said, I'm gonna jot this down for when we get to the demo because what you've demonstrated is, hey. I'm listening. We're going to get to this, but we're not getting to this right now. We're doing discovery. We're not jumping right into the demo. The other thing to think about is sometimes I try to ask for permission before I share how I can help somebody. So if somebody's monologuing me a lot and I've gotten them to talk and talk and talk, I might say, well, you've just shared a lot with me. I I have some ideas about how we might be able to help you. Is it cool if I share those with you right now? I'm asking permission before I jump into a pitch because they might have more they wanna share with me. So I think we've done an okay job here, and we're wrapping towards the end of the discovery call. Now it's time to do what we call driving towards next steps. So I wanna think back to the beginning of this upfront contract where we said, hey. Typically, these calls go one of two ways. You might hate some of the social proof that I share. You might hate what I tell you. You might realize we can't help you at all. If that's the case, totally fine. Remember, this is one of our philosophies. If you can't help them, that's alright. There's a million other people that you should be cold calling or reaching out to or helping out. If you can't help, no worries. But if you can, time to book a demo or move to the next step. And so what you do is you call out, hey. We've got six minutes left here. I know in the beginning we talked about these calls end up going one of two ways. I guess I'm curious how you're feeling. Would you like to move and and schedule a demo? I sometimes even say, well, you've shared a lot with me, and I'm a little bit biased because I work for thirty minutes to presidents club, but I think we can help you out. Would would you like to see how we can? That's how I propose moving to a demo. Exactly. And now once you've gotten and only once you've gotten the affirmative that they like what you're putting down, that's when you can start to spend the last couple minutes digging into the buying process. And this is going to largely vary for your sales cycle, but some oftentimes things that we're gonna be hitting on are things like who needs to be involved, what is the deal process, what are other checklist items like procurement, infosec, and legal, and then most importantly, when is their target go live? And what you need to do is based on your specific deal cycle, you need to walk it back to what that means they need to do today. And so for example, we're recording this podcast episode in July. If I know there's a comp cycle for Pave that's going on in November, people think they need to sign on in October, but that is not true. They actually need to sign on next month in July. They need three months of runway. And the reason for that is because we have really tentative data. They're gonna have to go through procurement. We're gonna have to go through InfoSec review. It takes two weeks for legal. Plus implementation would take six weeks for the first product, four weeks for the next product. And I now need to educate my buyer on all of the sales cycle steps that need to happen before that so that they need that deadline. And so from call number one, you need to understand when they need to be live, what is the business driver for them to be live, and then you need to find all of the things including the sales cycle that need to happen between now and then and back out the timeline for them. I think that's it. I think we just led a pretty dang good discovery call. Arman, do you have any other one off tips that you wanna share with our lovely thirty minutes to president's club fans? The last one, you always have to have a meeting on the books. If you're doing a pipeline review with me, I'm gonna be a stickler on this. 70% rule. 70% of your ops could have a meeting on the books, and they'll be the skim your next steps column in Salesforce. Almost every single one of those should have a date next to it, which means that is when the next meeting is. You should always put that on the books in the last five meetings minutes of your meeting. Even if there are other people you have to multithread with, put a placeholder on your champion's calendar and say, hey. My guess is it's not going to work. If it does, add the other people onto the call. If it doesn't, we can move it. But always have something that forces next steps on the book. Never leave a meeting without another meeting on the calendar because the one time you think it's okay, that's the next time you're gonna get ghosted. Well, the great thing about that is that calendar invite serves as a reminder for everybody to when you get to next Friday and it's like, oh, they haven't gotten back to me, everybody sees that invite, and it's a great excuse to re reach out to the other person. So, Armand, this has been a really fun episode. Now we're gonna move to the final question, and you got to ask me the final question one. So I'm gonna ask the final question to you today, and it's it's it's our usual one, but it's gonna be forcing you to be discovery centric. So my question for you is what is one bad habit related to discovery that every sales rep needs to discover its way to the trash can, ditch, burn, throw away because it hurts them more than it helps? If a discovery call is going poorly, you can call it out and have fun with it. A lot of people rake their prospects over calls, and they rake themselves over calls for thirty minutes getting one word answers. And there have been times where I've been on super uncomfortable discovery calls where clearly the person's not engaged even though they requested a demo. And I've said things like, hey. You're really ruining my Gong talk to listen ratio right now. Could you help me out, or am I totally putting down the wrong thing here? Do not be afraid to call it out. Do not be afraid to show your personality. In other words, think it, say it. The more you can focus on having discovery as a conversation and having fun with it and taking risks and stop thinking about discovery framework, the better you'll actually get at selling. So that's what you gotta stop doing. Stop being a boring square and start doing some disco the fun way. Alright? That's how we do it here. Oh, this episode was the fun way. Thanks everybody for listening. Stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alright. So your playbook takeaways are number one, the first area that we talked about was the three thirty MPC discovery philosophies. So number one was make it a conversation. Number two was figure out the technical problems quickly and then get off of them to business impact. And then number three is be disarmingly blunt. If you gotta give price, give some price. If you gotta describe your weaknesses, describe your weaknesses. Do not be afraid to call out the obvious things. We talk through the agenda next. Build rapport quickly based on their business or based on them, and then get off of it. Don't talk about the weather for ten hours, and then jump right into your upfront contract. Keep it simple. There's a time check, setting the expectation that you're gonna ask them questions, and then anchoring to next steps. And then the last question we always ask before we jump right into Cisco is why they took the call. If they don't get you right to the problem with why they took the call, that kicked off discovery. You should start by trying to understand the situation very quickly, but then, again, get off of the situation and get into why this matters from a problem standpoint. And then if you get stuck at surface level problem, get them to tell a story. Use a humbling disclaimer. You need to get them to tell stories that evict emotional pain, not just surface level pain. And don't make it an interrogation. When you actually find some problems, play it back. Play back what you heard. Label it. Say, it sounds like you really care about x, y, and z, and then give them a taste of what you can do. People should not leave a thirty minute disco call having no clue where you could help them. They should feel like someone listened to me, and I'm super excited to see the rest of what they got because I think they can help me. And then lastly, you're driving towards next steps in the last five minutes. One, get the affirmative and call out the fact that you propose next steps at the beginning. Two, get commitment on next steps for the buying process based on whatever it is. And then three, make sure you always have a meeting on the books. That's your disco playbook. Nick, how can people help us out here? Folks, I never complain, but it is 07:59 on a Tuesday evening. I started work this morning at 06:30AM. I mean, I did take a yoga class around 05:30, but that was the only break I took today. We are working really hard on this show, and it would really mean a lot to me if you shared this episode with somebody who might get some value out of it. We work hard on the show. We really love everyone who messages us on LinkedIn and and listens, and we appreciate you all. We do this for love. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes of presidents club.
