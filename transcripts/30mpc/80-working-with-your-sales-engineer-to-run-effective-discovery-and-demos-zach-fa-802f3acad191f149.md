## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arvon Frogg. I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have a friend of the previous guest, Florine at Lupio, and he is now a killer AE over at Salesforce. Nick, why should people listen to the man Zack Farber? This episode made me really happy because we talked to a lot of guests who do their own demos, but Zach doesn't. He has a team of solutions consultants, and he sells an entire suite of things. And so we can't know everything about everything. So this one was really helpful in terms of, like, how do you prep a solutions consultant? How do you quarterback a two or three hour demo? And how you do magic sometimes with your prospects? Three, two, one. I know nothing about everything. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Zach. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. Hey, guys. So my first takeaway is become friends with your prospects. Now I'm not saying become best friends with them, but the more genuine a relationship feels, the less transactional a deal feels, and the more open your prospects are gonna be with you. One way I try to do this is if I get a bunch of questions over email from a prospect, I will respond to every question with an individual video. Just full screen, my face answering their questions. A, it's gonna get my face in front of them more than my competition's face. And and I'm gonna give them just a like a real genuine response that'll resonate with them a little bit more than just a a typed out sentence. Beautiful. What's number two, Zach? Number two, take advantage of your Zoom background. One of the biggest advantages of of working from home the last year and a half is that you can show your personality without having to say very much. It allows you to get people to get more curious about you, but also shows that you aren't just a person behind the screen trying to sell them something. You're an interesting person that they probably wanna get to know a little bit better. I do this with interesting pictures that I put up on my wall, but it's not just pictures and art that are gonna make your Zoom background a little cool. If your prospect's a Beatles fan, wear a Beatles t shirt. You and your prospect both like dogs, get your dog sleeping on the couch behind you or even bring them on camera and introduce them. Take advantage of the fact that you can you're at home. You can show them a little bit about you and get them a little more curious about you. Very cool. Round us out of tech. What's number three? Number three is incorporate your hobbies into prospecting. Now people like seeing what other people are passionate about. I do this with magic. I'm a big geek. I've been doing magic for twenty years. I post magic tricks on LinkedIn that I think will resonate with others, and I try to tie a sales tactic into it. But it can be done on calls. It can be done in emails anywhere. And you don't need to know how to do magic to incorporate your hobbies into prospecting. Just talking about something that you're interested in can go a long way. Art, music, beer, passion really shines through. People respect it. People like it. It makes you seem real, makes you seem genuine, and it will really help you, build a relationship with someone. So, Zach, I'm curious because at Salesforce, my understanding is typically you're working with a named account base, so you're typically working with an existing book of customers as well as net new business. How do I break this tension of this rep is trying to sell me because, you know, the sales rep Salesforce rep comes knocking on your door. They're like, alright. I know they're gonna try to sell me something. What are some ways with my existing customers that I can make it feel like I'm not trying to sell them and out of every single interaction that I have with them? A, don't try to sell them something when you're talking to them. You're calling them just to introduce yourself. Say, hey. I I am I'm a real person. I am your main point of contact. I wanna make sure that you're getting the most value and that I'm here to support you as you grow. Not trying to sell especially on those first couple of calls, you're not trying to sell them anything. But also using some social touches just to put yourself out there to put you on their radar, whether it's, like, posting videos, which I do a lot of, liking their content. I'll sometimes just pop in and just view a couple people's profiles every couple of days just so they get that notification. They have that familiarity with me. But the main thing is don't try to sell them something on those first couple of calls. You're just reaching out to introduce yourself and just and, you know, build a relationship, potentially a friendship, like I mentioned. So I'm curious in those first five minutes of any call, whether it's a demo request or someone new that you're meeting, oftentimes, reps revert to basic things like how's the weather and all of this nonsense, and the prospects are like, okay. Let's get on with this thing. What are some things that I can do differently in those first five minutes of the call to separate myself from some of the noise? So first thing is do a little research before the call. Whether they're an existing customer or net new that you're reaching out to, I kinda go as deep as possible. So there's LinkedIn, which is amazing, but there's there's Twitter. There's Instagram. Not that many people have private profiles. You can actually see what they what they like. And I don't think it's weird to actually say that right off the bat. I'll sometimes say, I'm like, hey. I gotta ask. I was on your Twitter, and I noticed you did this. That's crazy. And just, like and then let them talk about it. People love to talk about not only themselves, but things that they're, like, what they're interested in. Right? So if you bring it up, people tend to respect that you did, like, a a deep lurk as long as you kinda bring it up in not a creepy way. I called it a work, which is a little counterintuitive there, but you know what I mean. I'm curious, Zach, a little bit about okay. So, like, yes. We've kicked off the meeting. We just talked about Arman's corgi for ten minutes. It was a great conversation. We're both dog lovers. And, like, eventually, we have to get into the meat of the meeting where I'm providing some value or doing something that makes this person be like, alright. I wanna meet with this guy again. Can you talk about how you run, like, those initial meetings where it's like, alright. We know we're gonna have more, but we gotta do something here. Yeah. Well, I mean, I'll always have some sort of agenda unless it's a cold call. Like, they'll know the agenda going in, which is, like, intros. If if we're talking Salesforce, like, how Salesforce can fit into the business. I try to cap like, those intros is where I'll I'll have that small talk. I try to cap it at no more than five minutes, and I will I will end it after going for a couple of minutes. Especially if things are going really well, end it right in the middle, be like, hey. This is awesome. I wanna make sure we have enough time to talk about, you know, what we came on this call for. Because two things happen there. One, they will respect the fact that you're sticking to your agenda and making the best of their time. But also, you just had this great conversation. You just ended. They're gonna wanna talk to you again. So you're kinda getting two thing. You're getting, like, their respect out of it because you're respecting them. But they will likely, you know, wanna know more. If you had a good conversation, you just cut it short. Think about anyone you've met who you're, like, talking to. Like, I gotta go, but let's continue this. You wanna talk to them again. Right? Yeah. I wish I could feel that way about Arman, but, sorry. That's cruel of me. So okay. I I wanna I wanna talk about that, like, pre meeting agenda that you're sharing. You're sending that, I'm assuming, like, a couple days in advance. What's in that agenda? Does it just say intros and here's what I wanna talk about? Or can you talk me through the pieces of that? Yeah. Well, usually, if I'm sending an agenda, that's after I've had some sort of touch point, whether it was, like, we were emailing, we were chatting on LinkedIn. I'm like, alright. Let's set up a fifteen minute call to actually, you know, talk about this in a little more detail. I'll usually send it with my calendar invite. So I'll send a calendar invite over and be like, hey, Nick. You know, as discussed, here's what we're gonna chat about today. Intros, you know, how Salesforce can fit into the business, your current challenges, next steps. And I'll always include next steps because, again, you wanna does five minutes at the beginning or just as important as those five minutes at the end? So you're setting this pre meeting agenda. You have your intro, where Salesforce can fit into the business, and next steps. Can you tell us now you've gotten on that call, how do we actually go about setting an agenda for that call? When we start the call, I I'll just say to you, hey. Thanks for hopping on. Just before we start, just wanna confirm that we're on the same page. We're gonna chat intros, hop into how Salesforce can fit the business, challenges, and next steps. Am I missing anything, or is there anything you wanna add to that? Always give them the opportunity because sometimes they'll jump in and be like, I don't wanna talk about my challenges. I just all I wanna know is x. I'm like, cool. Let's just hop right into that. I'd let them dictate the agenda. Keep it as loose as possible. Like, you can cover it in any order. Most people are cool with starting with intros, but let them sort of either confirm or deny kinda what what you're gonna chat about. Oh, you just made me so happy when you said, cool. Let's get right to that because I can't tell you the number of salespeople who, like, whether it's a call or a demo, the prospect says, hey. I really wanna make sure I get x out of this call. And then they, like, push that thing to the end of the meeting or they they show that feature in the demo is, like, the eighth thing that they've shown. And if the customer says they wanna see something, you get to it right away because then they're like, alright. This guy's tracking. Like, he's listening to what I'm saying. But most people, they wanna follow that prescribed order and go through things. And then also the idea, like, if they can like, let them disagree with your agenda because if you let them disagree, like, that means they're involved. You've said this, phrase, how Salesforce can fit into your business a couple times, and I'm assuming that's sort of, like, the launchpad for the entire discovery process for you because, I mean, you have a bag of a lot of different things that you can sell. Can you talk about how you tee that up and how that, like, drives the whole conversation? Yeah. So I want that to be very general because most people don't under they don't know how much Salesforce can do. Like, most people, if you say, hey. You know what Salesforce is? For people who do, they say, yeah. It's a CRM. But it's so much more than a CRM. So I'll ask that question if they get and then usually, they'll maybe ask me to clarify a little bit. And I'll be like, don't worry about the Salesforce aspect of it. Tell me about your business. And it's like, let's get into that a little bit so that I can understand. I'm like, there's there's no end to what's sort of possible. But the more I understand about you, the more I'll be able to prescribe something that'll be most beneficial. So that's actually an intentionally vague question, which depending on what you sell, could obviously tweak that a little bit to maybe the specific aspect of a business that you're helping, you know, bring value to. But I I want to be vague there so that they go on a tangent because there's hundreds of products that they could benefit from at Salesforce. I don't want them to only think like, okay. Well, my pipeline looks like this, and and this is what I want it to look like. That's great information for me, but I wanna know more than that because there's so much more that I can help with. I wanna dig in on this a lot because you have marketing cloud that's sold to marketers. You have CRM that's sold to salespeople. You got marketing cloud, CRM, commerce cloud, Einstein. Now you have Slack and all these different things. So they start telling you about their business. Where do you take discovery from there knowing you have 100 different products? Like, how do you, like, come away with three, four, five things that you know are gonna be a fit for this customer? So this all comes in the benefit of of team selling. So when I'm having this initial conversation, it's usually just me, maybe one or two other people from the other end. I'm not saying very much on these calls. Like, I'm just letting them talk, and I'll ask more questions just to dig in and dig in and dig in. If I sometimes will record these calls if the if the prospect's comfortable with it so that I can take it back and then kinda analyze it, but also loop in the other members of my team who will co sell with me. So we have solutions engineers, and we have solutions engineers for each aspect of of Salesforce. Like you mentioned marketing cloud, you mentioned commerce cloud, Einstein. There's experts on each one of those. So once I get I just wanna get the initial high level overview, then I'll have an internal meeting with some of the experts from my team to dig in. Like, hey. Based on this conversation, what do you think would be most beneficial for them? And then we'll tee up another call, and I'll bring in some other people from our end to dig in further into specific aspects of our first conversation. So it's really I I think of myself as I I'm quarterbacking all these conversations. I'm just I wanna make sure all of the right people are in the right room at the right time so that they all get the most value from each other. Can we pick, like, a deal as an example? And could you give us a sense of, like, hey. What did we get from the discovery call, and then what did you discuss in the team meeting so we can make this a little bit real? Well, it's kinda interesting. Like, I'm thinking if you sat down with Nick, the VP of sales for thirty minutes to presidents club, some of the stuff that you just talked about, like, we use Slack for our team to, like, collaborate and prepare to launch shows. And I do use a spreadsheet to keep track of all of my sponsor sales. And we're trying to launch our newsletter and, like, get that out to people. And so, like, if you sat down with me, like, we could use help in all of those areas. I'm sure you could get us to a better plan of Slack that would help me. So, like, if I just told you that, like, we're in a discovery call now, like, what the heck would you ask me? Because you could take it any of those three directions, and sure you're gonna go back with your team and figure out how you can help me the most. But, like, when I say I've got those three sort of things, how do you choose which direction you're gonna take the conversation? Because you could ask me more about any of those things. Yeah. So I I'd honestly, I'd probably take those three. I'm like, alright. Nick, you mentioned you're you're using spreadsheets to track your sponsors, using Slack to collaborate to get these episodes out. And of those two, like, what's most important? What when when you think of those two things, what's most important? What would you put as number one? What would you put as number two? So let I let the prospect sort of dictate because sometimes it can be, like, 10 things. Are we gonna be talking for an hour? They're giving me a, like, a ton of challenges that they're having. But let's take a step back. Like, right now, what's your of those 10, let's pick three and then go from there. I know, like, to focus on those to start. But then I have a lot of ammo to continue the conversations, like, you know, on our next call. That's a really good point. I guess I lost myself in the, like, the, okay. Here's all the things that I care about, but you're right. Your job as the seller is to help me prioritize and, like, help me get clarity around what's important because I was just brain dumping on you there. Like, here's all the things I wanna do. Right. But I never really thought about what's most important. So, Zach, let's say you've gone back to your team. You have three or four products you could potentially sell to Salesforce, and what you've done is, like, really solid discovery. Then what happens? Are you running three separate demos? Are you running three discovery calls on each of those products and then three more demos? Are you doing one shebang massive three hour demo with every product? What do I do next? Yeah. That's a great question. So the the goal here I mean, our calls tend to be long because it's the solution's pretty complex. So, like, a discovery call is an hour. I know sometimes people can do it in thirty minutes. Ours tend to be at least an hour. I try to have as many internal meetings as I need to have with the individuals, make sure that they're all aligned on time. So I could bring all of us to the disco and to the demo afterwards. I'd rather somebody be on, like, an hour and a half, two hour demo than be on three one hour demos. And, like, it sent kinda see the same thing and have the same sort of conversations over and over. We'll get on, like, a let's say, let's call it a two hour demo for looking at, like, three solutions that are really gonna impact the business. And back to the agenda, really break out. Hey. For the first thirty five minutes, we're gonna show you Sales Cloud. For the second thirty five minutes, we're gonna show you Marketing Cloud. And then for the last thirty five minutes, we're gonna show you how all of that ties together to, you know, improve your business. But, yeah, to answer your question, definitely, I do not wanna have four demos. That's, like, that sounds, like, awful to me. I would not wanna put anyone else through it. So, Zach, you you're doing a two hour demo. You have multiple products in there. When Nick and I were cofounders back in the day, we used to always really think about when should we go up to pitch. And what we tried to do is go after the first couple pitches before sort of the middle of the session. Because at the end of the session, everyone was fatigued and no one's paying attention anymore. But if you go right at the beginning, people's expectations aren't set. And so we sort of wanted a couple crappy pitches to go up first, and then we wanted to knock it out of the park. Mhmm. But, unfortunately, your entire team is pitching the entire way. And so how do you think about which products you should show first, middle, and last in that demo? Yeah. So it definitely depends on who I'm speaking to. But if I know somebody doesn't have, like, a CRM at all, for example, and that's their number one priority. And then marketing I mean, they're both very important, but marketing is they maybe they weren't on the initial call. They're joining for this demo. I wanna go in order of what's top of mind for them. And to make sure it goes smoothly, I've been talking about a lot of internal meetings. Like, in I think in sales, your internal relationships are just as important as your external relationship. So you wanna I wanna make sure I'm on the same page with everyone on my team who's gonna be on a call with me. So if I have a solutions engineer, another AE, we will kinda have like a like a practice run. Right? We'll kinda go through them. Alright. I'm gonna say this, then I'm gonna hand it off to you. You can jump right into your demo. I'll have a slide ready to be like, hey. Demo with Nick, and then Nick will jump in. So I wanted to be very clear with what they're watching so they know exactly what's happening. But we practiced a little bit. We got our transition set up, and we're good to go. And now I've worked with my team a while, so we could we don't necessarily have to have, like, a super long prep session before, but we'll I'll always do a bit of a run through to make sure we're on the same page so that it goes smoothly. So that let's say that we have all of our transitions set up. You have your nice slide that says, alright. Next up is Nick. My guess is you're not only being the transition man saying, alright. Here's the next presentation and the next presentation. So in those thirty, forty minute demos as an AE, what are you doing to remain active in the sales process? I always will sprinkle in some questions. So if someone's talking about how challenging working in a spreadsheet is, if we're going back, Nick, to what you were saying, I'll send that I'll interject. I always try to interject a little because, again, I want my face to be the face that they know. They're talking to a bunch of other companies. Right? So I want them to always know. Zach kept chiming in. He's making sure this is running smoothly. Zach is making sure that they're focusing on the right thing, so I'm getting the most value. So someone talks about a spreadsheet, I'll hop in and be like, hey. Just so I understand. Like, how long is that taking you? If you have to estimate minutes, hours, how does that take you? They'll answer, like, awesome. Cool. And then I'll hand it back off to the my SC to continue. But I always try to get I'll try to dig out some ROI as the the SC's put on this amazing show. I'll try to dig just into some ROI as they're presenting. Well, it's interesting, Zach. Like, I used to play a really similar role where I had multiple solutions consultants, and I was the guy sort of quarterbacking this this this orchestra. I'm the conductor. And one of the things you have to think about is when you have your SC showing a demo, they've got a lot on their mind. Like, they're sharing content. They're making sure their Slack doesn't, like, show notifications when they're trying to share their screen. They're, like, managing the audio and all the people in the room. Like, there's a lot of pressure on the person showing the demo. And when you interject or tie what somebody just showed back to what was in the notes, it might seem really simple, but you're actually easing a lot of the pressure off that person, like, letting them take a breath and get a sip of water. And that's really important because if you just, like, show up and say, here's Arman. He's the SC. He's gonna show the demo. Put yourself on mute and then do email for the next two hours. Like, the person's gonna bomb. But when you say, and, hey, guys. One thing to note is I know Arman just showed x feature. This actually might help with what Dave mentioned in the discovery call. You're tying back. Like, your job is to tie. Here's what we're showing you to here's what you told me, and here's how we help, while also selling as a team. Exactly. Exactly. And and tying back to what you spoke about earlier, we talked about the agenda. If they have something that's really important to them during the demo that's coming up, stop and be like, hey, Nick. You mentioned on our call last week that this was super, super important to you. You're gonna wanna hone in here because this is gonna cover exactly what you mentioned you were having a challenge with right now. If somebody comes on and they're bringing up things that have never been like, we've done a few hours of discovery and then we're getting ready for this demo. And then somebody comes on with, like, something completely out of left field. The way I would approach it is I I would speak to that, but I would also, again, like, set expectations, be like, alright. So we custom made this demo based on conversations we had with Nick and Armand. We're gonna cover x, y, and z today. Dave, so you mentioned super import is that is would you prefer to see that? Because we can set up a separate call and dive just into that. But I wanna make sure we cover what we've, you know, discussed with Nick and Armand for the last couple days. Is that okay? Very rarely will somebody be like, no. I want you to scrap all the work you were doing with my team and only show me this. Because really if if it's the, like, the CEO on the call, the CEO doesn't always know the challenges that his team is experiencing. A lot of the discovery, all of the information that's gonna go into the demo is coming from the team, not directly from the CEO, depending on the company size. So if you kinda level set and set the expectation there, you can help sorta set your solutions consultant on the right track so that you're not setting them up to show a bunch of stuff that doesn't matter. On that note, I'm curious, Zach, like, are what are you doing to prep your SC effectively so that they know all the context and the main high points to hit on in your discovery call? Yeah. It's a great question. So we I always have a shared document with my SE where after a disco, my disco before they run theirs, I got all my notes in there, and then we have a call where we can talk better a little deeper. I'll likely record the call when the prospect's okay with it as well. So they have the the the video contacts, and then they have my notes. They will then go into the discovery call, and they'll take some additional notes as they go. But we'll always have, like, a at least a fifteen minute meeting before we get on a call together so that they can clarify anything from my notes, make sure that they understand what they're walking into so that they are not, a, asking them the same questions that I asked to get them to repeat themselves. Just dig in a little bit deeper. And I will tee up the call that way. I accept I say, you know, I'm I'm a generalist when it comes to to the products, and I wanna make sure I understand your business and where your challenges are. I'm gonna bring in an expert to get a little more technical and take a much deeper dive on our follow-up call. So that way, we're both set up to kinda cover what we need to cover to show them the most value on that demo. So, Zach, let's say we've done all of our prep properly. We've gone through the demo. We haven't fatigued them with too much software, and it's gone really, really well. Going full circle to building relationships with your prospects, making sure you have a good champion relationship. So you're done. That call ends. What does follow-up look like after that call? Yeah. Great question. So I, like, send individual emails to stakeholders, and they're, a, a lot more likely to respond. The bystander effect is a very real thing. You send an email to group of 10. Maybe you'll get somebody being thanks. You send it an individual email to be like, hey, Zach. That was great. Or Zach, that was good. But there is one part that I was a little confused about. You'll just get a little more information when you send it to individual people. I also like to throw in a video. And you could use the same video for each person. It doesn't you're address the company like, hey. 30 of president's club team really enjoyed going through that demo with you. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out. The video actually doesn't have to be that informative. It's just an additional way to personalize it. And, again, your face is in front of them after that demo. So, Zach, I'm sending these one off emails. Sometimes I struggle with what to put in those emails. Sometimes it's like, hey. Here are the problems we're gonna solve. Sometimes it's, hey. Here's what we just demoed. Other times, it's a video. And And so when you're sending those one off follow ups, what's actually going into those emails? I like to start it with mentioning something that it's, like, casual, non demo related. That way so, like, I was talking about the top of the interview about having my dogs in the room or maybe someone asked me about this stamp collection on the wall. And then from there, I'll touch on a couple, like, maybe two or three things that really stood out to them. So if I got a good reaction or they wrote like, oh, wow. Yeah. That seems like it would be so helpful. I'll mention those. I'm like, during the demo, you know, this a stood out to you and b stood out to you as ways that can really affect your sales team. And c stood out to your marketing team as a way to really, you know, automate their processes compared to what they're doing now. And I I would have also gotten next steps on our call. So I'd be like looking forward to connecting on Thursday. If there's anything that comes up between then and out, give me a call or email. Looking forward to speaking then. Zach, this is awesome. I really appreciate you coming on the show. We are running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question, which is we've talked about a ton of great things that salespeople should be doing. Now let's talk about things they shouldn't be doing. So the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople doing that they gotta stop doing because it hurts hurts them more than it helps? This is gonna sound a little counterintuitive, but don't worry about being so professional. I think people really get caught up in being, like, being super studious and professional and but the more yourself you are, the more people will wanna talk to you. The more professional you are. Not to say be unprofessional, but the more professional you are, you can't it's harder to connect. And people just aren't gonna walk away from that conversation being like, like, I liked talking to that person. They'll get the information they need, but you also need them to like talking to you because people do buy from people. It's true. Do not confuse formality with professionalism. Zach, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? No. I mean, follow me on LinkedIn. I try to post, some cool magic tricks mixed with sales tactical sales, advice. It's fun, but I try to change up, you know, what's what's showing up in your feed and stand out a little bit. Awesome. Zach, thanks for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Zach Farber include, number one, after that big multi threaded demo where you do two hours of show in software, always lean on your champion and force the invite on their calendar to do a touch point after the meeting. Number two, throughout that demo, always make sure that you are not just sitting there on Facebook. Make sure you're jumping in with questions, trying to quantify ROI, bringing back the discovery into the demo, which brings us to number three. Prior to that call, you wanna do at least a fifteen minute with your SCs to make sure that they know what happened in discovery and the high points to hit on in the demo. And then lastly, number four, when it's all wrapped up, send individualized recap emails highlighting some of the points that hit home really, really well. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? If you haven't subscribed to our show, that would make me happy. I like getting subscribers. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes to Presidents Club.
