## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Cegalski. And today, we have a wonderful colleague of a previous guest, mister Miles Kane. It's actually mister Evan Cassidy, a senior director of mid market and growth expansion sales. Nick, why should people listen? I'm thinking about one of the biggest palms are sweaty, knees weak moments in sales, and it's when you've had a good discovery call, a good demo with your champion, maybe you've met some of their team, and now you're walking into that thirty minute meeting with the CXO, the big exec. And you've gotta nail this because if you don't, it breaks your deal. If you do, it makes your deal. So hold on to your spaghetti. This is a fun one. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Evan. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Awesome. So number one is the value hypothesis. And so what this is is before your next discovery call, when you do your research on the company, you know, executives, write down the top three focus areas for that company at this moment and where your product can help either, like, solve challenges or help companies in those three areas. What this is gonna help you do is understand where to guide that discovery conversation to where you can have the most impact. Example of this could look like you know, from the Drift side, will look like this. In preparation for the call, I noticed your company is using, used the recent funding ground to grow sales headcount, expand internationally, and improve your customer experience. That's great because we've helped customers like Okta, Workday, ServiceNow do exactly that. I'm curious which of those three is your team most focused on and why. Beautiful. What's number two, Evan? Number two is the three minute executive demo. We all know getting time to executives is super difficult, and they don't love talking to salespeople. And so what's an easy way for you to warm up an executive before a conversation if you haven't actually talked to them before? We love using video for that. And so if we have that conversation happening, what we'll do an example of that will look like this. Hey, mister CMO. Really excited to speak with you in our meeting on Wednesday. I know we had personally haven't spoken yet, so I wanted to send a quick video outlining what the plan is for the call, what value we've discussed with the team, and how that product actually works, and how our solution is going to, align to your key initiative of reducing inbound touches of pipeline by 50%. Very nice. What's number three, Evan? Round us out. Number three is, the executive team sell. And what this is, you know, most of us at start ups, we're trying to sell at mid market enterprise companies. A lot of times, your executives, CEO, head you know, VP of sales, CMO, they wanna help you close deals, but they don't necessarily always know the best way to how to get involved into a deal. And I think a lot of times, reps are don't exactly know, hey. When should I bring an executive? Or, they might be, frankly, afraid about the ability of having an executive, having eyes on their deal. So this is just a very easy tactic that you can use mid mid stage deal where you have a great champion, but you're trying to get higher in the deal. Just craft a quick email for your CEO or, again, CMO to send literally, like, here's the CEO's email address. Here's the CMO's email address. Here's a draft copy of what you can send. And a copy of email can look like this. Shannon, it's come to my attention our teams are talking. I wanted to send a quick note to you directly so you have access to me in case you need anything. We're excited about the opportunity to partner with you with your team, and I'm happy to chat through any best practices you have. That's it. Alright, Evan. So let's zoom in on this exec call. Maybe you've done a discovery call. You've done a sixty minute demo. Maybe you've even done a demo for the team, and now what you need to do is you need to boil this up in a thirty minute meeting to an executive. How do you structure that call? So I think there's a few ways you structure that call. One is that doing research on the persona and the person that you're talking to is really important. You should know exactly what they care about before you hop on that call. One tactic you can do to get that is do a champion pre call before that executive conversation. That's super important in order to kinda get on the same page with what you're gonna cover in that call and make sure that what you're gonna talk about is really gonna land with what matters to that, in our case, like, what matters to the CMO. And so one way you can structure it is having that executive summary ready and kinda leading with what you see about what's happening in the business and the executive summary of what what are the kind of the three things, very similar to value hypothesis. Value hypothesis just kinda focus more on, like, discovery, but executive summary of what you've discussed with the team so far, what impact you think you you can have, and have that, like, really a one slide of, like, what that executive summary is of those three areas. The other key tactic that I've seen work really well is once you describe that executive summary, go to the CMO, engage them early, and say, what were you hoping to get out of the call today, and what you what do you wanna personally focus on? And, typically, the CMO will tell you, like, well, here's the one thing I wanna talk about. And because you're talking to executive, you have to make sure you address that one thing and you spend time there. Because once you do that, what's tip what typically happens is they're gonna start to open up about all the other things that you're kinda curious to learn about. And so when I think about structure, a lot of it is preparation with your champion. What what do they think is gonna be important? They're gonna help you with that executive summary. Have that executive summary ready so that you can kinda kick off a call with that executive summary of here are the boom, boom, boom. Here are the things that we're gonna chat about, and then make sure you ask the CMO directly, where were you hoping to get out of the call today, and what's most important to you? And shut up. Evan, I guess one consideration that I have in one of these calls where it's like, okay. It's the first time that I'm meeting the CMO. I've done a ton of work with the team, but now I've got this person for thirty minutes. And if I botch these thirty minutes, deal's probably dead. If I nail these thirty minutes, okay, this we've got a good shot at this. So I've gotta be on my a game. I see an advantage to getting intimately familiar with what that CXO really cares about. Meaning, if I sit down with Armand and I have a thirty minute great discovery call where I, like, deeply know what he cares about, okay, I can probably use that to win the deal. But if I only do discovery in that thirty minute meeting and Arman's like, wow, I like, that was a great therapy session, but I have no idea what this company does, I've I've probably dropped the baby a little bit there. So I guess, like, how do I strike a balance there? What's your sense on that? I think we've all been on those calls where you hop in with the CXO, and they're like, just show me the product. Like, I don't wanna hear the whole thing. I don't wanna hear about what you guys do. I don't wanna hear why you're barely competitors. Like, CMOs love validation. Right? So you gotta talk about, hey. For example, here's what the Okta CMO, like, thought this was really powerful of how they use this functionality of Drift. Right? And start to kind of, like, talk about other people like them and how they've gotten value out of certain parts of the product. That typically gets them to open up a little bit. So I think validation from peers as you show the product of, like, hey. This product helped this person do this is gonna help them open up, and then you have to you have to be good enough to do that and then ask questions about discovery. So an example of that would would look like this. So if I was demoing Drift, I would say, hey. You know, for example, we have a Docu CMO. Their team is using Drift AI. They've been able to use this functionality, as you can see here, to kind of, like, you know, scale revenue without, needing to, like, overhire sales headcount. Just kinda curious. Most CMOs we talk to are really working really closely with the CRO. Like, how are you thinking about how to scale revenue in a way that's that's super efficient over the next year? So show the pack, make sure you have validation, and then use that as a way to kinda earn the right to ask a question of something that is important for you to understand or something that you think is gonna be important for them to key in on of, like, hey. This is gonna tie back to this initiative that that you all are focused on. So, Evan, I'm I'm curious. When we talk about this demo or, frankly, this entire call, one of the unique challenges that you might have at Drift is a lot of people think of Drift and they think, oh, it's an awesome chatbot. And you guys do way more than that. But the reality is a lot of CMOs might jump on that call thinking, oh, I know Drift. It's a chatbot. Here we go. What are you doing in this call to repaint the vision of what Drift is and expand the horizons early on in that call so you don't get pigeonholed in the the chatbot angle? I mean, frankly, it's something that we've probably had to as reps, you've had to kind of had discussions about for for years. One of the best ways you you have to combat that is you gotta expand people's horizons of, like, what they think about your product. Right? I think a lot of people think a product is a point solution, and your whole job a lot of times as a rep is, like, you're trying to paint how how do you expand and think bigger about what what your product can do? And so I think if you get that like, let's say I got that objection. Like, we're on a call. Someone was like, hey. Drift, I know what you guys do. I think one easy tactic is like, oh, great. Like, when's the last time you, like, you saw demo Drift? When's the last time you had a you had a conversation with a with a salesperson at Drift? So those are two things of just like, okay. What's the context here? Like, are they talking about, like, hey. I just talked to someone last week, and I know what Drift does? Or is this, hey. I talked to Drift three years ago, and I I see you I see you all in this limelight. Right? So, like, that can also give you permission. Let's say it's like, well, I like, two years ago. And it's like, okay. Well, I totally understand. We definitely need to chat, but a lot's changed in two years. Like and there's a bunch and this is where customer validation still report. There's a bunch of really best in class customers like Okta, ServiceNow, Workday that are they're using Drift to really transform how their sales teams go to market. And there's a lot of, like, interesting things that we can get into. So I think kind of being able to understand the context and then frame, like, hey. This is a transformational product for companies that deploy it in these ways to kind of give you a sense of, like, okay. There's much more we can be doing. Like, that is one aspect, but there's way more that goes into it. So let me show you the different areas that we can really impact your go to market teams. And then we can kinda check-in later to see, like, hey. Do you still think of this in that way, or do you see see us in a different light once we've once we've kinda had that conversation? Is that is that fair? You know, Arman, one way that I've heard the question that you ask where people think you're just x or you're just y addressed before, Sarah Brazier does this really well with the phraseology, my biggest concern. And what she'll do is she sells for Gong. And so she'll show up to a meeting and she'll say, hey. My biggest concern coming into a meeting like this is sometimes my marketing team does such a good job promoting, like, the call recording aspects of what we do. When in reality, there's, like, 82 different ways that we can affect, like, GTM teams. And so I guess I'm hoping that we can just talk about overall what your goals are as a CRO aside from the stuff that we do related to call recording. And more often than not, we can help with some of those other areas too. And what she's doing is she's calling out the fact that, like, hey. Yes. We help with this specific thing, but I don't wanna just get pigeonholed here. Evan, I wanna go to something that you talked about earlier, which was this pre meeting. You're sending this video, and you're doing this because when you've got thirty minutes with an executive, getting an extra five to communicate some information with that pre meeting video can be really, really powerful. And so a question that I have for you is in between meetings, before and after, what sort of information are you communicating with the customer, and are there other mediums through which you're communicating? It sounds like video is one of them. I imagine you're, like, messaging with people on apps. Like, I'm curious what sort of in between meetings looks like for you. There's so many different ways that you communicate. So I think in between meetings, I think about it a few different ways. So video is definitely one. We use Drift a lot ourselves to communicate with our customers, so there's a bunch of different things from video to meetings, chat. There there are ways that we can communicate, with our customers. LinkedIn's a big one. So if you wanna get multithreaded, like, who are the people that I haven't talked to yet that I go I need to talk to? And one simple tactic I'll do is, like, let's say there's people on the sales team I haven't talked to yet. I literally will just connect with them on LinkedIn and send them a Drift video about, like, maybe a conversate help them, and that's a really easy way to get multithreaded. It also I think one of the neat things about being a martech is, like, you can show people how they can use your product, And that's, like, one of the probably the most fun parts about working at Drift is, like, I can send them that, and then they're like, I could be doing that. You know? Like, I could be using that as a way to get wider on my deal. So it's like you're you're showing them how to do it while you're actually using it to help you sell your deal. So that LinkedIn video tactic is one we use all the time to get wider on our deals and get and get exposure to more people in the organization, and then Slack's a big one. Slack is something that we've adopted quite a lot as a way to to communicate, and it's like work texting. That's really all it is. But we use it all the time, and so, like, I have certain people on the team that have been using Slack, and it's helping close deals way faster than they would have before. And so you do have all these channels, and I think sometimes it can be a little overwhelming. Okay. Great. I have, like, four or five different things. Like, which one should I focus on? I think that's maybe not the best way to think about it. It's just, okay. Great. Like, where am I in the deal? What do I need? Right? Do I need to get higher, or do I need to get wider in the deal? And then what are the different ways I can do it, whether it's LinkedIn, whether it's Slack, or using, like, video and things like that to kinda get wide in the organization. So I think, like, I'm a big believer. Like, I come in every day. Like, what how am I moving this deal today? And so a lot of times, that's gonna be those different digital channels, and then the other part of it is research. Right? So you gotta be looking at that company every single day. What's happening? What movement is there? Are people posting about certain things on LinkedIn that I saw that's really interesting? Are there similar customers? Is there, like, a CMO that I sold to before that is super happy with Drift? And, like, how do I get that validation in front of them? Just little things. I think we all a lot of us learned this from Dave Gerhardt when he was head of marketing at Drift. They were just like, give, give, give. And so, like, give people value in those little ways of, like, how validation can help them, how someone else is really successful with the product, and just keep doing that. And those types of things can typically accelerate your deal, you know, pretty quickly. One rule of thumb that I always have is after that first discovery call and that first deep dive with my champion, at that point, my champion should usually be bought into the deal. And usually what I'll do is I'll be like, hey, so we can prep prior to that executive call, let me get your number so we can get on text. But I actually think that's the perfect time to be like, hey, are you on Slack? And then from there, I can actually keep the Slack thread open the entire time in the sales cycle and then start adding people as they get added to the sales cycle to that Slack thread. So I'm curious, is is that how you're using it? Is that the best time to do it? Or are there other times where you're popping open the Slack channel? So that's a big one. On on the expansion side, you have the discovery call. Great opportunity to get right into Slack. And then where we saw it worked really well from, like, the the net new side is we were running pilots or even just, like, running an enterprise sales cycle because it can take six to nine months. Getting your Gil team into Slack with their team to start communicating and talking about different things that you're trying to kinda work on is is a big part of that. And so we we've done that a lot too to help, like, especially as you get to, like, that mid stage, like, hey. We think we're gonna do this. Let's make sure that we've scoped everything out technically. And then the the last part of where it seems to be super helpful is on the paperwork side, which is like, hey. Like, legal security, all this stuff that needs to get done. Like like, they can add like you said, they they'll add people into Slack, like, a lawyer into Slack or a security person into Slack where you can then help them make sure that they get all the documents and and things that they need. And so those are all ways that you can really accelerate your deal from, like and and just using a a simple digital channel to kind of, like, work the deal in between the meetings is such a critical skill set in enterprise, and, like, Slack is a great way to do it. Evan, I actually wanna go back to something that you mentioned just before that, which is this concept of using Slack in your red line process or in your legal and security reviews. And one mistake that I've seen reps who are selling mid market and enterprise for the first time make is they get to the fifteenth of the month. They need to close the deal by the end of the month. It gets to legal. They send the MSA, and they're like, alright. We're good. It's illegal. Right? It's illegal. It's fine. And I told them it needs to get done by the end of the month. They said it should be fine, and the next thing you know, the first cuts come back on the twenty ninth, and it's an entire page of red. And so what are things that you're doing in the legal process the moment it starts or even before it starts to make sure that that thing moves on time and fast? Yeah. So it's funny because my wife's actually the in house attorney, so there was a lot of inter interesting conversations in the household about legal working with salespeople. So the the biggest thing is always, like, a work back plan. You have to have a work back plan in place with your with your champion and with your your economic buyer. So, like, what are the things that you wanna get done by when? Right? And it always should be tied back to value, not, like, when the deal closes. Right? It's like that's that's a you thing. Like, when do they see the value? Work back from, like, achieving the goals they wanna achieve and then use that as a way to work backwards so that there's motivation for them to do it. And so why the work back plan matters when it comes to legal is that's you project managing the deal and kinda having that agreement of, like, hey. We need to get legal done by this date in order to get the contract signed, which is gonna enable you to get into onboarding, which is gonna enable you to see the ROI from the product by x date. Right? So just having that plan in place, I think, is super important. That's one that, like, keeps you in line. Getting intro to legal, personally, is always a good one. Right? So make sure they're on the thread with your counsel that you can hammer on any questions. We do that all the time. You know, making sure that you understand if the bandwidth of legal team and where they're at and then also understanding, you know, has this person a contact on legal, or are they just, like, one of many people screaming to get to go buy some software that legal team might ignore? So those are all things that you kinda wanna vet out to understand. Like, what is the likelihood of this getting done, and what can I do to kind of make sure that I'm dotting my i's and crossing my t's with my leadership team of, like, how I'm forecasting this deal? Well, you're right. It moves way faster when you actually have the person redlining the contract involved in the thread. It slows it down when you have Arman sitting as the middleman where you're like, here's my red lines, and then he goes and takes it to your wife to go red line it and review and then she gives it to Arman. It's best when you can get everyone to communicate together. And sometimes that's not as obvious to, like, your champion because they might not buy stuff all the time. And so I believe it's your responsibility as a salesperson to one suggest, hey, this will be way less painful if we can get my legal team and your legal team on a thirty two minute call together. We'll get this whole thing done and save ourselves 800 emails. One thing that I did recently, I got a brutal red line sent to me. And on the Word document that I got, the name of the attorney was there as, like, comments. And so I could see her name. Even though I didn't know who it was before, I saw her name. And I was able to figure out her email format and add her to the thread. And the way that I consider that, it's like look. I know her name. She sent me some red lines through this person. I'm going to, like, get her email format and add her to the thread. And that's how I involved her in the conversation. So, Arman, is there anything you do to sort of speed things up at the fifteenth? Yeah. Evan, one of the things that you mentioned really resonates is this work back plan is you need to start with the goal they wanna achieve, work it back through implementation. But then again, the line item on your work back plan cannot just be legal. I will actually break down the parts of legal into that work back plan. And so usually what it looks like is I'll actually break down, okay, we're gonna send you the MSA on this date. You're gonna give us first cuts back by this date. We're gonna return first cuts back by this date. And then after that, if there are more cuts, we're gonna jump on a call. And I'll actually space out all of those things. And my favorite question to ask Evan, to your point around you need to figure out if they've done this thing before. My favorite question to ask someone going into legal is, hey, when you've bought stuff in the past, typically like how long does it take them to get the first cut back? And you can learn a lot by someone's answer. If you get a lot of, I don't know or I I think they're pretty, you know, they tend to not be super bad on the legal side. If you get fuzzy answers like that, now what I need to do is educate them on how legal usually goes and be like, hey, what I need you to tell your legal team to do is get first cuts back by this time Because if they don't, I know how this thing goes, and I promise you this is gonna kick out your implementation, which is gonna make you miss that business goal, and it happens all the time. It's it's so critical tying it back to to the value. Right? I think if if you have something aligned to value and to business initiatives, that's where legal is typically the most motivated. So that that's going back to the point we've talked a lot about how to sell to the executives on calls, why it's important to get them involved in deals, and and this is actually another perfect example of having executive involved in your legal conversations is is super key because that's another thing that can actually help you accelerate the deal, or they can send an email or you can make sure they lean on legal to actually get something done if it's a core again, if it's tied to a core initiative, and that's why everything we've talked about about building with value and, and making sure that that the executive is clear on that is super important because as it gets down to crunch time, that's where, they can really lean in and help you get the deal done. Evan, this has been a fun one. We are running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question. Final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Let's now talk about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? It's always talking about the product before you understand what business challenges they actually have. And so, like, show before you understand. I think that's always that's always a tough one because once you start doing that, it's a really slippery slope in terms of the conversation flows by. You go through a discovery call. You haven't actually learned anything about, like, what they're actually trying to solve and what's important to them, and then you get out of the conversation. I think a lot of people still tend to you find someone that's super excited about the product, and they wanna learn about something, and it's it's really easy to get caught up emotionally in those things. And it's hard to kinda take a step back and just be like, wait a second. Like, why are you asking that question? Why is this actually important to you? And so understanding why things are important before you talk about the product is really key. Beautiful. Evan, thank you so much for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Evan Cassidy include, number one, before any executive presentation, make sure you have a pre call prep with your champion. Number two, that's a great time to pop open a Slack channel with your champion and also get on a text basis. Number three, when you get onto that executive call, start with the priorities upfront and ask them, what do you think? Do you align with that? And then do demoscopy along the way. And then lastly, number four, whenever you're entering legal, make sure you have a work back plan and lead that work back plan with the goal that they want to accomplish and create micro milestones from there for every step of vendor review. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? So, Arman, when I was a boy, I did not buy lunch at school. I brought lunch from home. And my mom would pack me this nice lunch of leftover chef Boyardee from the night before in my lunch box. And we have a similar box, not filled with spaghetti, but filled with all of our tactic tear downs, our battle cards, and some other goodies from thirty minutes to president's club. So if you wanna steal Arman's email template, if you wanna steal my cold call scripts, if you wanna get our mutual action plans, go to 30mpc.com and click on the toolbox. No spaghetti, but I promise there's some other good stuff. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
