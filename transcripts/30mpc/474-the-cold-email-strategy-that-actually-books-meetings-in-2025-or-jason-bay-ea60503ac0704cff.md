## Transcript

So there's three types of offers that you can leverage. First one is pitching the blind date. Nick, what I'd like to do is put you in touch with Armand. He's our account executive. He has ten years of experience working with VPs of operations exactly like you at companies like x, y, and z. The second type of offer is these one to many offers. I was giving you a call. I actually submitted a support request, and when I compared the response time to your competitors x, y, and z, it was about twice as long. You got a minute for me to share a little bit more why I decided to call you specifically? The last is really the holy grail for any enterprise rep, and that is a one to one offer. Any solution that touches something that you can see, if you're selling to brands that sell b to c, you could experience the brand. So there's a rep at one of my clients that actually went into a Patagonia store. They did a quick analysis of the store experience. They took a selfie of themselves standing in front of the store, and that was dropped into the email. If you're selling something really large, very high end, very enterprise or strategic, like, this is a great differentiator to get yourself in the door. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my host, Nick Sigelski. And, folks, today, we have a very special guest, not because he hasn't been on our show before. He's been on our show, I think, at least four times. He hosts a webinar with us every single quarter. But the reason that Jason Bay, the founder of Outbound Squad, is a special guest today is because over the next several weeks, he's actually going to be taking my place as a cohost to Nick on the sales show. And the reason for that is he is going to be launching what you will probably see is the greatest cold email course of all time in partnership with thirty minutes to presidents club. So, Nick, why should people listen? So this episode made me rethink my CTA when I'm cold calling and when I'm cold emailing, which, dude, we've done over 300 episodes, and I've always been like, my CTA is already open to learning more when I'm not cold calling you out of the blue. And Jason talks about the four different sort of levers or pillars that you have available to you to get your prospects' attention and increase the propensity of them saying, yeah. I'm willing to meet with you. He talks about volume. Right? Okay. We can just do more activity. He talks about relevance. Okay. If I'm targeted better or my messaging is better, that increases the chance of me getting a meeting. We've got the delivery. If my tone is really good or that my email is really nicely written, it will increase the chance of the meeting. But the lever that I have never really considered is is what he calls the offer, which is what do they get by saying yes to a conversation with us that is not directly related to our product? And Jason gives us a number of different frameworks and layers and examples for, like, the offer of why someone might meet with you unrelated to the prospect. And I think this is going to be the future of, like, how we actually start conversations with our prospects, especially as AI becomes, like, bigger and bigger and bigger in the prospecting space. So this one will probably make you rethink your prospecting if you give it a listen. In a if you give it a listen. And a three, two, one. Let's roll. Alright. Jason, welcome back to the show. You might remember that we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get yours. So these actionable takeaways are all about the offer. So 58% of buyers, when polled, reported that they waste the majority of their time on meetings with salespeople. Surprise. Surprise. Right? So the offer essentially, what we wanna think about is your buyer's already been burned before. They already know what a a fifteen minute meeting usually turns into a thirty minute meeting. So how can I make a better promise in terms of value in return for time? So there's three types of offers that you can leverage. First one is pitching the blind date. This is the easiest one. If I was gonna set up my friend, Armand, on a blind date, I would date, I would make sure to talk about how good looking he is and how charming he is and all of this other stuff. I'd really hype him up. Right? It's a great offer. Great offer. I thought we're not supposed to lie to our prospects. Yeah. But the thing in sales is, like, we just don't do this in sales. I worked with a client that sold an automated welding solution, and the SDRs would set up meetings for their AEs who had, like, over a decade of experience working with, like, VPs of manufacturing and these manufacturing plants. So, like, that's what we taught them to pitch, and literally, they would book, like, twice as many meetings by weaving that into the cold call pitch, and it sounded something like this. Nick, what I'd like to do is put you in touch with Armand. He's our account executive. He has ten years of experience working with VPs of operations exactly like you at companies like x, y, and z. You're gonna learn a lot about what's going on in the welding industry right now. So worst case scenario, pitch the blind date. If you're an SDR, pitch the AE. If you have SEs join that first call, pitch that person's expertise. Let them know who they're gonna be meeting with and how much of a resource they're gonna be. That one's the easiest. Right. So, Arman, the takeaway for you is next time you go on a date, bring along someone who might be able to help you. Like, maybe I can come and be your SC on your next Sales engineer Nick on my next date. Got it. Alright, Jason. What's number two? Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. The the second type of offer is these one to many offers. A one to many offer is a really, really high quality resource. Think about the stuff that you get from 30 MPC. All of the guides on the website, stuff that's extremely tactical, but that could be repurposed across one to many. So an example of this, I had a client that sold to ecom businesses, and their marketing team put together, like, a state of ecom. Later, what they actually did that was pretty cool was they hired a third party to mystery shop all these businesses. So they knew, like, response time, hours of operation, channels they provided customer support. And that talk track sounded something like this. Hey, Armand. It's Jason with so and so company. I was giving you a call. I actually submitted a support request. And when I compared the response time to your competitors x, y, and z, it was about twice as long. You got a minute for me to share a little bit more why I decided to call you specifically? And, like, with that talk track, you're in the door every single time because their next question is usually, wait. Wait. What did you do? Oh, we actually mystery shopped you and x, y, and z competitors. Found some interesting things that I wanted to talk to you about. How are you guys thinking about response time and whether or not customers decide to to tab hop to some of your competitors? Just a super easy talk track. Very nice. Brown us out, Jason. What's number three? The last is really the holy grail for any enterprise rep, and that is a one to one offer. So these are custom tailored experiences or resources that you promise to create for the prospect or that you create in advance of reaching out to them. I'll give you several examples of this. A lot of our cybersecurity clients, they'll actually do, like, a free risk analysis, and they'll benchmark their cybersecurity and their their posture, how they handle things. They'll benchmark that against other competitors. So that's something that you can talk about. If you sell any solution that touches something that you can see, like a website, their social presence, whatever it might be, you can literally do a cart audit, their shopping experience. You can audit their website. If you sell something that helps with SEO, you can look at that stuff. I've have a client that has a podcast recording software. I mean, there's just so many things that you can do. So a personalized audit really helps. If you're selling to brands that sell b to c, you could experience the brand. So there's a rep at one of my clients that actually went into a Patagonia store. They did a quick analysis of the store experience. They took a selfie of themselves standing in front of the store, and that was dropped into the email. For some of the larger, more strategic reps, hosting workshops with their team and your internal experts, like, you're bringing stuff in. Like, the whole idea here is that if you're selling something really large, very high end, very enterprise or strategic, like, this is a great differentiator to get yourself in the door. In the prep, you were talking about the offer as one of four potential attention grabbing levers that you have. And I'm curious if you could walk us through what those four are. Yeah. And then we'll dive deep in each of them. So there's four levers. The first one's volume. This worked really well when volume was a lot lower, when email volume incoming email volume was lower, incoming call volume, social, LinkedIn especially. When volume was low and you had a lot of intense volume and you could do it in a really structured productive way, that's what all of these sales engagement platforms really popularized that works so well, like, five to ten years ago. Where volume still can work is taking a very uncrowded channel like direct mail and doing a lot of it. Right? In person stuff, visiting, folks on-site, that's a very uncrowded channel. The second lever is the offer. We've already talked about that one. R is for relevance. So this is where all of the AI stuff comes into play right now where you're basically saying, if I could be hyper relevant, if I could put something in a message, in a talk track, in a pitch that's, like, really relevant to your company and you as an individual, like, that might really pop. And I think that the relevance factor is gonna significantly diminish with AI because it's gonna become really, really easy for everyone to put a fairly relevant message in front of someone. And then last but not least, this is I know you guys are big on this. It's delivery. You cannot underestimate a rep's ability to when they get someone on the phone. Just being a good conversationalist or being a great copywriter, like, your delivery and soft skills, it can make up for a lot. So it's volume, offer, relevance, and delivery. Jason, I have a question. So you talked about the offer, and you talked about the three different layers of the offer. The first one is just, like, hyping up who the buyer will be meeting with. The next layer was pitching one to many offers, and then the next one was, like, a one to one super tailored personalized offer. What do I do if, like, my company doesn't have great content? Can I use third party content, or does that, like, sort of diminish the credibility? What recommendations would you have for that rep, Nick, a couple years ago? Totally. This is such a great question. And and what you didn't have then that we have now is ChatGPT, Gemini, whatever LLM that you wanna use. This is literally a prompt away from creating and gathering some of the best insights you could possibly imagine, especially with deep research and chat GPT. So to give you some examples, I cited a stat earlier, 58% of buyers, according to RAIN Group. RAIN Group is a sales training company. That's a competitor of mine. I don't I've never run across them in a deal, but, like, citing these stats and resources and things like that, even if it's a competitor, maybe not a direct competitor, like, I wouldn't do that for someone I typically go head to head with. But it's definitely good for credibility, especially if they have bigger name recognition than you. But one of the things I would do in chat g p t, like, if you sell a contact center solution like one of my clients does, have chat g p t do deep research on what are base level standards and guides around, like, first call response, response time, net promoter scores, CSAT scores. Like, what are the trends? And more importantly, what is the analysis? Like, you can have chat g p t build you a report to benchmark this stuff. We're talking one slide. You can have chat g p t do that for ecom. Cybersecurity is another really big one. I mean, any industry that you can think of, you can leverage AI to gather a lot of these really great insights for you to have a really good conversation with the prospect. Dude, one of the things that I did is I I took transcripts of all of my sales calls. 10 most recent ones that were with our target buyer. I put it into chat g p t, and I wanted you to figure out, like, hey. What are the questions that all of the prospects are asking us? What are their top priorities? How are they getting the job done right now? What have they tried? What are the problem? There's so much language there that I took from actual customer conversations that I could turn around and then say, can you help me find insights that support some of the problems that these folks are having? Just so much that you can do to create your own one slide version of this that you could find in a matter of minutes. It just doesn't take hours to do this stuff anymore. How are you actually delivering, like, this one to many thing? Are you, like, just taking the chat g p t output and putting that into, like, a Google Doc, or are you working with your marketing team? Like, what do you actually recommend reps listening to this do if they maybe don't have a marketing team who can support them in this stuff? Yeah. So if I wanted to operationalize some of this information, I'm gonna work it into my cold calls and cold emails. Yeah. And that's gonna sound a lot like what I did before. Hey. We ran industry benchmarks against x y z competitors. Or in our month's scenario, Pave has talked to 300 x y z's in the last twelve months. I'd love to share patterns that we're hearing around point number one, point number two, point number three. That's in an in an email. That's the reason that you're asking for the meeting over the cold call, etcetera. In terms of how that gets operationalized in the sales call, it's so easy to weave that right into your discovery. Like, you wanna find stuff that supports the problems that you help with. So if we're using the comp stuff, like, how am I comping people? It's like, hey. Here's a big question around how should I be comping people based on x y z. Here's how our customers think about this. And more importantly, like, how are you doing that right now? You should know why it's really hard to do things the way that they're doing it right now and why it's not right. That's the ultimate offer is one that gives you insights that actually helps you do the discovery. So let's say that I have some sort of offer. We know what it sounds like in the prospecting messaging. You get on to an initial discovery call or, like, an offer presentation call. How do you go from giving them the offer that you promised and then transitioning to discovery? Let's use the welder offer. At the very beginning, if we start back from that, it's the STR pitching. Basically, hey. You're gonna hop on a call with Nick. He's got a decade plus of experience. He's gonna run you through how other manufacturers are dealing with the welding shortage right now. And the other thing that he's gonna show you is how they're automating some of those really large, traditionally hard to automate parts. That's the pitch. I get on the meeting. Let's pretend I'm the account executive. I'll just, like, role play style this. So if I was setting the agenda, it'd be like, Nick, it's good to meet you. I heard you had a great conversation with Armand. One of the things he probably promises that we're gonna talk a little bit about how similar customers like x, y, and z are one dealing with the labor shortage around welding, and then also how they're thinking about automating some of those really complex parts. I figured for today, I'd start with that for a couple minutes. I think there'd be some really good conversational starters. And then if you're open to it, I would I would love as much as you're willing to share. I have some questions on how you're thinking about approaching this. And if there's a fit, I'll talk a little bit more about how we might be able to help and what next steps would look like. Does that sound cool for you today? Anything else you wanna make sure we talk about? No. That that sounds good. Yeah. I'm really curious to hear about some of those insights because that's been something we've been dealing with. First slide would be stat. It's basically a graph that shows the demand for labor of welders is going up, and the talent is going down. Hey. How does this compare to what you guys are seeing? I'm really curious, like, what we're hearing from folks like x, y, and z is that they put job ads up. No one's responding to it. They're working through recruiting forms. Nothing's working. What are you guys trying to do to recruit welders right now? And I'm just gonna go through that whole line. Like, there's a bunch of problems. It's like I'm building up that problem of, like, talent is not gonna fix your problem. So what it sounds like you're doing is the opening question or element of the meeting is you're leading with a piece of data that supports the problem that you believe they have, that you know that your product can solve. Solve. And then what you're doing is you're asking, how does this problem backed by data compare to your experience? Sorry to interrupt you. It's it's really I think an important piece of context is, like, it displaces the problem. Mhmm. Like, it makes it less personal. It's like, I'm telling you that this is a problem that is pervasive across people like you and people in your industry, and I have third party data to back it. But then what you're doing is you're if I think about, like, the some of the common, like, selling nomenclature, you're getting detail about their situation or their current state by asking, alright. Like, how are you dealing with this? Does this match up to your world? Yes or no? Do you have that problem? And then what are you doing right now to actually solve or try to make that go away? And what I think that opens the door for Jason is for you to figure out the gaps, the holes that they have, and how they're trying to solve that problem, which should open the door for you to sell your product, if I'm not mistaken. Exactly. Let me give you another example just so people because people who are listening to this are selling a lot of different stuff. Let's use the contact center. So this client sells something that helps reduce cost to serve. Cost to serve is important because contact centers, ironically, don't want people to call in. They want AI to handle stuff and chat bots and that sort of stuff. So one of the stats that we might lead with with that is only 16% of customers actually fill out customer surveys. And the reason, Nick, I thought it would be interesting to start here is that we find that the vocal minority, if we build a process around them, these are not the people that are most useful to get information from. Like, we need a way to extract that information from the other 84 of people. And I'm curious, how are you thinking about getting all the feedback from the people that never ever share feedback with you? How are you collecting data across the calls with them, the text messages with them, the DMs, their behavior on the website? How are you capturing that information? Yeah. I I mean, this is making me think tell me if I get this right, Jason. So I used to sell a billing solution to law firms, and a big trend that was happening in that industry was the clients of these law firms were requiring bills to be sent in, like, this very new format where, basically, the clients were using AI to, like, analyze the bill to like, if the law firm used a word they weren't supposed to, like, research or prepare, the client would say, oh, we don't pay for research. You should know your stuff. And so these law firms had to be very specific and careful about, like, what they did and didn't put on their bills. And the new format was called e billing. Really interesting. I know. What I probably would lead with there would be, like, a stat of the I know there was data out there of the percentage of law firms that we're seeing an increase in volume or maybe the volume increase of e billing in the space to show there's a trend of more of this. And I would talk about, okay. Yeah. Like, every law firm I talk to tells me this impacts their margin, their time to collect, etcetera. I guess I'm curious how are you thinking about navigating that back and forth billing process, making sure your attorneys are accurate in their descriptions of bills, etcetera? Because those are the problems that I know they're dealing with. And that, I think, would open the door for a discussion of problems that they have that we can solve. But But am I thinking about that the right way, Jason? Totally. Data is really good. Don't get me wrong. You can't find data for everything. But if we were using the, contact center analogy again, I instead of saying only 16% leave reviews, what I would do if I was leading that sales call and there was, like, three or four people on there, they're like, hey. Who here has filled out one of those customer reviews that they ask you to fill out at the end of the customer service phone call? No one raises their hand. Like, your feedback is important, yet you are not collecting feedback from those people. So you can use anecdotes like that too and, like, analogies to make your point. They have to be really, really good, though. Like, it has to be as convincing as the one that I just used. It's, like, so obvious that the way you're going about this is wrong. So So you could use data, anecdotes, all kinds of things to, like, make your point at the beginning, but it needs to be based on what their peers are doing. So, Jason, these are the one to many offers that are really insight or information based. And I remember in the prep, you were saying that the one to one offers are the most powerful ones if you can get them. Yeah. So a couple of the examples you gave, could I give you a personalized audit of your website? Or I know when you're selling a training client, oftentimes, you'll do, like, an outbound sequence audit to make sure that it's performing the right way. So if I'm an AE, I might not be the most technical person in the world who's best equipped to do one of these audits. Could you give me an example of a way that an AE has given a one to one offer, whether that's leveraging their team or something else that is still just as valuable as some of those other offers that you described? Yeah. It's gonna depend on what you sell, and what can be really hard is what what you sell is very technical and it requires an SCU. You kind of need the company to have, like, an offer that they can do. You can think of this in a couple ways. If that's your scenario, you can think about how could I take something that I would normally do later in the sales cycle as a proof of concept and, like, cut it apart and do, like, the risk analysis if it's cybersecurity. I could do that upfront. Right? I think the most basic form of this, though, is almost every enterprise seller has some sort of business case calculator. Mhmm. Take that business case calculator and take, like, three to five metrics that you could gather and use that as your audit. So for example, if I was doing sales training, one of the things that I'll ask for is I'll say, I want these five metrics. I want the total number of reps. I want the total call volume, outbound call volume in a monthly basis, total email volume. I wanna know connect rates on cold calls and connect, to conversion rate into a meeting. That's, like, literally all I need in order to, like, benchmark that and compare to everything else that we see. And then to also show them that if we had a 10 to twenty, thirty, 40% improvement, here are the massive, like, pipeline increases that we would get, like, literally by the millions and tens of millions. What I find in doing this is that people are sharing information upfront that they wouldn't normally ever share in a sales cycle. You know how hard it is for me to get, like, metrics from sales leaders? Dude, it's so hard. I got to meet, like, the rev ops person. I get us, like, dude, just give me some quick and dirty math. That's all I need. I don't need the exact, like, down to the tenth of a percent. So that's where I've seen it, you know, be successful is, like, if we can talk for selling a marketing solution, like, let's just take some of the metrics that you would take from a business case standpoint around lead conversion, total number of leads, cost of acquisition, whatever it is that you're selling. Like, let's just get some of those baseline metrics upfront and offer to benchmark that against their competitors. What's the thing that keeps the person up at night or that piques the interest? Turn that into an analysis or an audit and use that to also uncover a problem for them. Yeah. And lead with it up front. It's like, imagine, like, I go into these first calls, and I already know where the gap is based on the metrics that they've shared. And I also know how big the gap is. Like, it's already been quantified. And then they're doing that because they they perceive benefit for themselves in learning how they stack up. And, like, it allows me to be more prescriptive with the advice that I give. This is where we can think more like marketers. Think about it. Do you guys give your name and email address and phone number without getting something in return for it? I put Arman's in when I'm doing it. Like, the answer is no. Like, no one just goes up and, like, they sign up for a newsletter. They're gonna get something in return. They they they download a guide. Like so why are we asking people to hop on a a meeting with us when we do outbound without giving them anything in return for that? This is why the conversion rate is, like, one percent, two percent, three percent. Like, yeah, you're gonna capture people that have active pain that wanna fix it. But there's other people. I'm telling everyone that's listening. It's like, dude, there's another twenty, thirty percent of people that have the problem that, like, if you help them quantify it and you positioned yourself as an expert like, think about that sales cycle. Just imagine you're a rep. You're in a sales cycle that started with you giving, like, an audit and, like, really great strategic guidance and benchmarking for them versus the person that's just pitching their solution. That's just another vendor. Like, you move into this, like, expert category where pea where they're gonna ask you for your take on stuff versus asking you to ask your boss to reduce the contract value by 10%. Jason, there's one other kind of one to one offer that I wanna dig into. You talked about free data, which we got into, but free licenses or pilots. And this is AKA the test drive. Oftentimes, what will happen is you'll get these runaway trials where it's like, hey. Do you wanna give this thing a spin? And you'll get a bunch of people who are, like, sort of tire kicking, and they just wanna, like, play around the with the product. So if I'm using an early trial or an early POC as a mechanism to start a sales cycle, how do I convert that into a real sales cycle? You have to have real give to gets. So for example, like, with our offer, when I'm basically doing a thirty minute audit for free, I'm giving them free course access to our best, like, cold calling and objection handling courses. I'm giving them an outbound with AI prompt guide work. Like, I'm giving them a lot of shit, but I'm just taking meetings with everyone. It's like you have to be a sales leader. You have to have a certain amount of reps. Like, we're gonna research the logo. Like, I'm setting the expectation that, hey. If you like what you hear, we're gonna spend the last five, ten minutes talking about our programs, and they cost 49,500 is the starting point. Like, I'm setting that expectation. If you're doing a proof of concept or a pilot, it's like, hey. We're not gonna do this unless we create success criteria for this, and we have the right people involved with this. I know this sounds like common sense probably for people that listen. There's so many companies that engage in pilots with zero success criteria. There are companies that engage in pilots with people that have no decision making power, and the decision makers have no idea that a pilot is even happening. Like, that should be a really easy give to get. I was watching the call recording of we hired a rep here at thirty minutes to presidents club to help sell some of our sponsorships. And I was watching one of his calls yesterday, and I was so proud of him because he was talking to somebody who was, like, a director, and we knew we needed the VP to, like, actually, like, thumbs up the deal. And it was an early early call. It was, like, first or second meeting. And at the end, he was like you know, they were talking about the VP of marketing. And he was like, by the way, like, are they aware that this conversation is happening? And I was just like, I just I really love that because, like, he got to sense check, like, is this deal real or not, or was this person just, like, kicking around? And they were like, yeah. They are. But, like, it was just a couple Slack messages. And he was able to turn that into the reason to help coach that person for how to go sell to the VP. And I feel like sometimes when you ask that, like, it feels weird, but it opens the door. We just assume that, like, when somebody is talking to us, that means the whole org knows, and that just isn't the case. Jason, the clock is ticking. We're running out of time. We gotta move to the last question, which is we've talked about a lot of really good things salespeople should be doing. Now we gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Oh, man. This is something I've been saying so much. I think people sort of get from a sales context that you should not leave a call without a next step on the calendar. You should not do that in a cold call either. The hardest part of cold calling is getting the person to freaking pick up the phone. Do not get off that call without a calendar next step. So even if that's the person I'm in a meeting room, hey. Totally fair. The reason I was calling you is x y z. Should we catch up later today at 2PM, or do you got a couple minutes right now? Catch up later take. Awesome. I'm gonna send you a calendar invite, Nick, for five minutes later today so that we can catch up on it. If the person says send me an email, I'm gonna handle that objection, do that thing, try to ask for the meeting. If they don't wanna take the meeting, hey, Nick. All good. How about this? I'll send you a calendar invite for five minutes, same time tomorrow. Take a look at that email. If you don't like what you see, decline the calendar invite. And if you do, let's keep the time. Do not leave that cold call without a next step on the calendar. You can always move it. Like, the chances of you getting in contact with that person go up exponentially. So do not accept. Give me a call this afternoon. Jason, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alright, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Jason Bey. What do you have for your two? So my first one is the three different types of offers that you can give. The first one is just pitching the blind date, hyping up the person that your prospect will be meeting with, whether that is your SE or an AE who has a ton of industry experience. Find a way to sell the value or the reason of, like, the person they're meeting with is worth their time. You've also got the next layer of one to many offers. So what are things that you can share that are high quality, reusable assets that have competitive benchmarks or other data that they might get value from? And then the third layer is the one to one offers, like a a workshop with their team and your internal experts or an analysis of their website to help them understand heat mapping and where they might optimize for click through. So that's my first one, the three different layers of your offer. My second one is if you choose to use that one to many offer, which I feel like for the sales I've I've led in the past, Armand, is probably the most accessible. When you kick off your meeting, you obviously have to make good on that offer. And Jason shared a really simple way to actually make good on that, which is piece one, you're going to lead with a visual that shows the data supporting the problem that you solve. So we gave the example of the welder, automation tool that shows, hey. Demand is going up, but supply for talent is going down. And then you just ask the prospect, how does this match to your experience, and how are you solving this? How are you dealing with this? And that opens the door to ask about problems. Number three. My favorite one to one offer is the audit offer, where you basically audit the biggest problem that you solve. So a couple of examples that Jason gave in the show. Number one, we talked about his cold email analysis or his cold outbound sequence audit where he will literally just tell people what's wrong with their outbound process today. He talked about other metrics audits, whether it's something where you're tearing down all the things that are going wrong in their outbound funnel or maybe something that's going wrong in your, like, website click funnel. At Pave, we talked about making sure that your compensation is, like, up to par relative to the market. So those are, like, three or four offers. Figure out what your audit or analysis offer is relative to the problem you solve. And lastly, number four, if you decide to give the one to one offer of pilots or free product, you have to have a give get. And the easiest give get is, number one, make sure that someone at Power is involved, and then number two, make sure that they're at least aware of what this thing costs on the back end. Alright, Nick. How could people help us out? Well, Armand, we were talking about offers all episode. And, folks, if you liked this episode, we've got an offer for you, which if you didn't know, Jason Bay is going to be releasing a cold email prospecting course in collaboration with thirty minutes to presidents club. And our offer to you is if you'd like a free module of that course, you can go check it out. There's a link in the show notes. I don't know what our get and return is for this one is, Arman, but go check it out. Maybe it will inspire you to buy the thing. That could be our get. Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week on the show.
