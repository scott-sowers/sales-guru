## Transcript

Sales managers, no one ever teaches you how to do your job. If you've ever wondered, why are my pipeline reviews useless? Should I actually hire this person or am I gonna have to fire them in three months? Or maybe my forecast is like a finger in the air exercise where I'm totally guessing. Guess what? You're probably a little bit like me and you had to figure out this stuff from scratch. Fortunately, I partnered up with the best sales leader in the game today. His name is Mark Casaglow. He led outreach from zero to 250,000,000 plus in ARR, and he has graduated eight sales managers who just became VPs. And that is through his three step sales management operating system. There's a special discount code in the comments. I guarantee it will be the best sales management resource you've ever used in your life. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And, oh, man, round two with the CRO of Catalyst. It's Marc Casaglia. Again, Nick, why should people listen? This was a creative episode. Well, it was a traditional thirty MPC episode, but we talked about getting creative with your deal structure. And so if you're having deals where it's like you get to the end and buyers are asking for funky things and terms and procurements in there and the CFO is in there and you're trying to figure out how to get your deals done, well, then you need to get this episode done and listen to this whole thing. And a three, a two, a one. If you want to pilot every one of our sponsors, now is your time. Roll the ads. Alright, Mark. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. What up? Yeah. Number one, the meeting swap, y'all. You find someone that you can get to at that deal through a mutual connection that accelerates trust and partnership. So, like, if I was trying to sell Arman, Nick, I'll come to you and be like, yo, Nick. I need help with Arman. Help a brother out and, like, give me an introduction. That's dope. So that Arman will talk to me. And because of that interaction, we're hoping that Arman's trust factor, like, goes way up, way faster than it would normally. Alright? So the meeting swap would be this way. Instead of me just calling up Nick or sending Nick a LinkedIn invite or something to be like, Nick, I see that you know Armand. Can you help me out? Why don't we go one step further and figure out what Nick wants? Right now, Nick is running one of the hottest sales podcasts on the planet. He's looking for sponsorships. Maybe what I should do is go to my marketing department and be like, hey. We're looking for some podcast partnerships. Maybe I should go to a couple of friends I know who are marketing and be like, hey. You guys looking for marketing sponsorships? I could take, like, ten minutes and probably be like, yo, Nick. Can you help me get to Arman? And, oh, yeah. By the way, I got three leads for you on people that you might be able to do with partnerships. Now listen. Now it's mutually beneficial. I'm swapping a meeting for a meeting. And, like, that actually puts it a what's in it for me into Nick's locus so that he can be like, hey. Let me go do this really hot for him on versus just like, yeah. I know it's like karmic. I gotta go do it. Whatever. And that energy is transferable. So that's the first thing. It's a meeting swap, man. Like, swap a meeting for a meeting. Don't just ask somebody for a referral or help because they owe it to you or you're connected. Like, let's actually be equal on what we're doing for each other. Beautiful. I'm salivating for those leads. Let's move on to number two. Number two is he who makes the deal wins the deal, or she who makes the deal wins the deal. Right? You have to get creative with your buying terms right now and what your terms of your contract are. If you're not, then you're gonna leave stuff on the table. What I mean by that is so listen. You gotta make sure that you create a creative deal structure with you and your manager. Get with your manager. Find out, like, what the craziest stuff they've done with other reps are. Go to your VP. Ask them, like, what other crazy deals. Listen. We did a deal recently where we did, like, a eighteen month buyout. It was a five year deal. We got them to pay the three and a half years upfront. It was a huge cash thing for us. Would we ever thought of that? No. But, like, we all got in a room where, like, let's do something crazy. Right? So you have to make sure you get something with your manager, then you have to sell it internally. Everybody knows that acquisition is hard and doing deals is hard. That is absolutely like a bedrock of what it is. But the other thing is is, like, create a deal where it's a win long term for your company. CFOs and VPs of finance are okay as long as you win long term. But what you can't do is, like, lose short term and lose long term. Right? You can't be like, let me give you the first year for free, or let me give you, like, a six month POC without something in return. And let me just tell you, a case study isn't something that anybody gives a crap about. So don't be like, I'm gonna get you a case study if you do this. Right? So make sure that you start to get into creative deal structure and go call your friends. Like, ask people who are doing crazy deals right now, get some ideas, and make sure you sell it internally. And then I guess we'll talk in a little bit about how to present it to the buyer. Right, Nick? Very nice. That we will. Round us out. What's number three? Last one is that b to c mall hustle. Listen. One of my first jobs in college was I ran the Sunglass Hut in the local mall, and I was in a little kiosk thing. And Homeboy ended up getting one of the top 100 stores in the entire country, entire world out of 2,500 locations. How did I do that in Podunk, Pennsylvania, where nobody wants to buy anything but $50 Oakley's? Really simple. It's like I went and got people. I was a hustler. I know we've all been walked by the guy that cleans your shoes in the mall or the person that has the miracle face scrub. Like, it's time to get a little bit on top of that sales hustle. So let me tell you how you do that in b to b SaaS sales. Real simple. Take your product and then do something with it that shows somebody what it's like to have in there. Let's say that you have an ecom thing. Let's go and make sure that we show what that ecom solution looks like on their ecom site. Like, do a little Photoshop work, get with in Google Slides, get with Midjourney if you're like an AI person, and figure out what that stuff looks like. Maybe you want them to see, like, what a dashboard would look like inside their own product. Go in there and get the names right, get the stats right, and show them what that looks like. Get that little sizzle going. And then the way you present it is three steps. Step one, tell the prospect that you've done something that's either a video or an image and ask them if they wanna see it. Most people will say yes. Then you send them the thing with no ask. Just be like, here you go. And then four hours after you send it or the next day after you send it, follow-up be like, did you see it? Would you wanna talk more about it? Three simple steps, a lot of sizzle, but, like, I'll never forget sitting out with the guy at the mall that cleans my shoes, and they look perfect. I bought the stupid shoe cleaner. Did I wanna clean my shoes? No. Did I think I had a shoe cleaning problem? No. But the sizzle was there, so I bought the stuff. You know, Mark, it was hilarious. The other day, someone complimented my eyebrows. And next thing you know, Nick is sitting at the kiosk getting his eyebrows threaded every single day before this episode. So I promise you folks, it does in fact work. Before we get into eyebrow cleaners and shoe cleaners and all these things, I do wanna go back to creative deal structures. So let's talk about that first moment that a rep sees. They're in a tough call, and they're bringing in their CRO Mark today. And it's CRO Mark talking to the head of procurement. And the head of procurement is like, Mark, every deal we sign, we want a ninety day opt out. What do you do in that moment when the ask first comes to figure out what you should do with it? The first concept is give get. So they're asking you to give something. So what do I wanna get back? So the first thing, what do you think the thing I want most is? The deal. Sign now. Yeah. Yeah. If I give you a ninety day opt out, can we get this deal done? If they say no, then that's your chance to be like, well, tell me what we would need to do to get the deal done. And that's when you actually get to the heart of it. But the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna yes. Like, right now, buyers have leverage. You have to get creative. If you say no, you're putting yourself at risk. Other people are gonna be desperate and say yes. There's things that two years ago, I would tell reps never to do. At Outreach, we thought that pilots were death. And we'd be like, no pilots. Never do it. We got enough value. We have enough customers. People know who we are. Like, we don't need to run that motion anymore. Guess what? Right now, somebody said, hey. We need to do a pilot. I'm like, yes. Do you need to do a pilot? You're gonna sign? So that's the first thing is to say yes. Second thing is give get, what should you ask. Third thing is, like, alright. Will this get me the deal? If not, what will get me the deal? So you can get a little bit more at the heart of it. And then the last thing is is, like, if you're gonna agree to it, then you have to say, listen. If we're gonna do a pilot, then we're gonna create one or two things that we have to hit that are doable. If we hit them, will you sign? And if they say no, what do you say? Then why are we running a pilot? I don't understand what's the point of the pilot if it's not to help you make a decision. And so that's where most people right now, I think for pilots, POCs, opt outs, and all that, they're pushing the limits because they know they have the leverage. And what they're doing is they're starting to ask for things, but they don't know how to actually use it to make a better buying decision. And that's what they actually wanna do is make a better buying decision. So you have to guide them to that better buying decision, which means you wanna do a POC? No problem. At the end of ninety days, we'll be able to do this and this. If we do those two things, do you agree to buy? And if they don't, then you gotta find out what the hurdle is because they don't really want a POC then. Mark, I'm curious about that scenario where you talked about setting almost exit criteria for the POC for, hey. You're not opting out. You're buying this thing. And I have to imagine that there are sometimes, even at Catalyst, where you'll get a buyer who will say, yes. This is what we need to accomplish. That's, like, one step beyond your control of what you guys do. Right? Like, you guys help, as I understand it, customer success teams, customer success leaders who wanna make sure that they're renewing and upselling their customers. And my guess is there's times where people are like, yeah. You know, we wanna make sure that we renew x percentage of our customers in this next quarter. And it's like, Catalyst, you guys can help with that, but if their CS team is total and utter garbage or their product doesn't work, like, that's one step outside of your control. And so I'm wondering, like, how do you respond in a scenario where their exit criteria is one step past what you guys are actually able to help with? So let's say that they said, hey. We wanna increase our renewal rate by 10 points during this POC. So the first thing you have to do is help somebody understand that in ninety days, that's impossible to do. Like, it's just not a right ask. Like, nothing in the world can improve your renewal rate 10 points with a lot of certainty that fast. First of all, what is the the time period in which you wanna do the POC? And what can you realistically do? And then there's two types of metrics, leading metrics and lagging metrics. Leading metrics are measures of effort. Lagging metrics are measures of execution. There's a lot of variables between leading and lagging. But one thing that someone can always can control is their effort. And so what I would do is I'd be like, listen. You're asking me for a lagging metric in renewal rate improvement. There's a lot of things that could influence that, and my guess is by the end, you might point to two or three things that help cause that that are gonna dilute what I might have done. Instead, why don't we go to a leading metric that shows that the extra effort, the extra activity, the extra leading things that the people are gonna be able to do with ours that we can 100% control. For example, let's say that you wanted to say every at risk account over a sixty day period enters into a data driven playbook, and we wanna make sure that every action in that playbook has been completed for those at risk accounts. That's effort. I can 100% make sure that that effort is done, and we can measure it in the platform, and it can be directly attributable to what we're doing in the platform. So that sounds to me, Nick, like a better thing to look at than, like, a downstream lagging metric because we gotta both agree. If we get the leading stuff right, it should lead to the lagging stuff. Right? It should result in the lagging stuff. So we get that agreed on, then let's work on some leading stuff that we can actually show direct attribution to. That's the number one mistake I see with success metrics or exit criteria is this based on lagging metrics, which should lead to the execution of the leading metric. You gotta move POC metrics deleting, not lagging. Mark, one thing that is sometimes concerning to me is I've been in that chair that you were in at Outreach as well where I was the no pilot guy. I was, like, the pilot killer. I was the opt out killer. Anytime a rep would bring it to me, I'd be like, heck no. You didn't ask the hard questions. They're gonna buy anyway. This isn't gonna stop them from buying. And now today, these things are coming up more and more and more and more, and a lot of people are telling me I should soften my position. My question to you is the devil's advocate would say that by saying yes first to that opt out ask, you may receive another ask, which is a pilot, and another ask, and another ask because by saying yes first, a savvy procurement person is gonna keep pulling and pulling and pulling and pulling and digging until they can come up with the hairiest, ugliest deal that Mark is willing to agree to. When a procurement person or a buyer is just throwing more and more and more hairy terms at you, how do you figure out if you take all of them on, if there are certain ones that are important to them? Because I could see this going down a never ending path of negotiation. Yeah. It's always with the clarifying question or the trial close or whatever you wanna call it of, hey. Armand, if we do this, will you buy? And that's how you stop it. Like, if they say yes, then you if you say, alright. Great. If they say no, then you say, well, what would it take for you to buy? Don't forget. POCs and pilots are conditioned response. Manny Medina, the CEO of Outreach, talked the this a long time ago. A company is a political organization designed and bent not to spend money. In order for it to spend money, somebody has to take the political capital they've gained and change that overall default way of running modus operandi into a way that will buy. Right? So you have to take something that doesn't wanna move, somebody that's willing to risk their personal political capital in order to get it to move. Right? So if that's the case, then what we need to do is we need to say, listen. If you want this to work out, if you want this idea to make sense so that your political capital stays in place, we need to make sure that I completely understand, like, what it would take for you to buy. And then I can tell you deliver that or not. And then I think also, like, this is where, like, the step back helps a little bit. And be like, hey. You know what? I don't know if we can do that or not. But you know what I do know is we can do this. Right? And I think a lot of times when you get a little bit more transparent, when you get a little bit more honest about what you're doing, people get a little bit more into it. So you might say, well, you know, listen. Just make it no risk. Listen. We'll do the POC. And if we do what we should do in the POC, you should wanna buy. If you do what we need you to do, you should wanna buy. But if we don't get where we wanna get, that's okay. We'll just walk away friends, and we'll come back again next year if you're evaluating another solution. Sometimes you just have to, like, make it okay to fail versus, like, you're so freaking, like, hung on to, like, winning the deal that you have that commission breath or that stink of desperation where you're like, okay. Well, if we're gonna do a POC, you do this and this. Just be like, okay. Yeah. We can do a POC. If it works out, great. If it doesn't work out, then we're not gonna do business. But, like, I need to know that that's what you need to see in order to buy. Like, is this part of the buying criteria? Is this, if we do this, will you buy? And I think that's a key question that a lot of reps just don't ask. They just say yes. And when you say yes, then they'll ask again for something else afterwards a lot of times. So we've talked about the opt outs. We've talked about the pilots in this case. Mark, it sounds like you're doing a lot of creative deals. Are there certain structures or terms that you're seeing come up more and more frequently? And perhaps could you give an example of a funky or creative deal that you use different terms to get that deal over the line? Yeah. Yeah. Listen. I remember for a long time, like, I would never do anything but pay upfront, anything but thirty day net terms. Listen. If somebody says I wanna do quarterly payments right now and I want a hundred and twenty day net terms, I just say yes. Ultimately, like, I need the deal. Right? So, like, now listen. Am I gonna do a give get? Yeah. I'm gonna give something, so I need to get something back. I might ask for a second year for something like that. Right? And I tell all my all my reps, listen. Go get creative. If you need to do it in the moment, I empower you to do in the moment. If you screw up and do a horrible deal, we'll talk about it. Just don't do it twice. The other one is the buyout. You need to get in front of people and be like, listen. Okay. Your current provider doesn't end for six months. Let's talk about what we need to do so that you're not double paying. You have to get good at the buyout, and that should be something your company gives you as a tool right now. Hey. If it's three months, you can do this. If it's six months, you do this. If you need to buy the whole year, this is what you can do. And you should demand from your sales leader, like, listen. It's hard to get deals in the pipeline. There's people that with their current provider that want to switch but feel handcuffed because they've already put money down or they still owe money. We can get those people in right now if we're aggressive with what we do. And, you know, you can say it's a bad deal, but you know what? When they pay that full amount that second year, guess what? It's a good deal then. So, like, listen. You should demand from your sales leader some kind of buyout positioning so that you know what to do when you get in front of those people and that you can go get really proactive with them about it. One of the things that really frustrated me when I was a sales rep was I didn't know necessarily the extent to which I could flex into some of this creative stuff. I didn't really understand where the guardrails were, and it felt like anytime we did something creative, it was super ad hoc. And for me, when I'm negotiating or structuring a creative deal, like, I wanna understand where those guardrails are so I know how creative I can get or how uncreative I should get. And I hear you saying, hey. ICs, you gotta go demand from your sales leader that you know what that stuff is. And I imagine there's a particularly low EQ way to go demand to your sales leader. Yo. I'm not winning any deals. I haven't made a cold call in a in a quarter and a half, but you need to give me more pilots and opt outs. Like, what's the right way for an IC to go approach their VP of sales or their CRO and say, hey. Can we understand how to get creative here? I think every VP and CRO right now knows how hard acquisition is and is talking to friends that are reinforcing that belief. It's just like sales. Lean into what the issue is already. So, Nick, listen. I've gotten a couple late stage deals that I lost. I felt like if I could get creative with them and empowered in the moment to make the deal when this iron was hot, that maybe I could've won a couple of them. Maybe I wouldn't have. But, like, at least I would would've felt like I didn't leave anything on the table. What I'd like to do is create, like, two or three things that I wanna propose to you that if I get into a situation again where I feel like I need it, I want you to, like, just empower me to make it. And if I screw up, like, listen, I'll come pay the cost of it. Like, we'll figure out what we need to do on the commission side. But, like, can we just try giving me a little bit more empowerment, having two or three extra tools? In the moment when they're ready to say yes, I can just get that yes and move on and get the DocuSign signed. That's a way that you think that you could go to your leader, and they'd be like, yeah. Let's go for it. What does a bad deal look like? A bad deal looks like they're short term and long term. Most creative deal structures lose in the short term, and where they're bad deals is when they lose in the long term too. A good deal structure is one where they might lose in the short term, but long term is good. Let Let me give you a great example. Let's say that we have a competitor that's charging a $100,000 a year. They just did their renewal. They have twelve months left on the renewal. We come in, and our price is at 80 k. Alright? So we're at 20 k difference. What we decide to do is we go in on first year. We're gonna buy you out. So we're down 20 k. So 80 k plus the the 100 k buyout gives us down 20 k walking into year two. Right? So what do we do? We put 10 k of that back in year two. So now we did 90 k. So now we're still down. We're now we're up 10 k, but we're still down all that other stuff. And then what we did in year three is we went up to 120 k. And so now we got back a lot of that revenue. Now we didn't give back everything in year one, but we got back a big chunk of what we did in year one. And by the time we get to year two, we're now over list. And by the time we're in year three, we're not in a really great, highly profitable deal. And so sometimes you can't get it all back, but you should be able to make significant progress and make it a really good, like, all star deal in year two or year three in that kind of a scenario. So don't try to say, oh, well, you know what? We'll give you year one, and then we'll do, like, $80.80. Then it's just an okay deal for years two and three, but you lost everything in year one. So I think that's where you go to your boss and be like, listen. I think I can get us to win in year two and year three if I do this. But we're gonna take a bath in year one. But we at least get them in and can get them working and get the revenue flowing. The number one thing that was most helpful for me was actually at Carta. Even though Carta's metrics were extremely healthy, one of the highest net revenue retention. They never lost customers upfront because it was a relatively cheap solution. Their customer acquisition cost was relatively high when compared to what was sometimes a three k contract. That said, the cost to buy out another three k contract is not that large when you compare it to the lifetime value of that customer staying for the next five years. And that's where I find most reps screw up is they don't know how to speak the finance team's language. They're speaking the language of, I have to get my commission check. We should win this deal now. The finance team is thinking in, how much is my customer acquisition cost and how much is this lifetime value of this customer relative to that customer acquisition cost. And so if you can sell the lifetime value of the customer and explain how you might have had to buy a little bit more from this customer upfront, but you signed a three year deal because of it. That's how you get your finance teams to agree to this stuff as you show them that you understand that the long term health of this business is aligned with the long term health of the types of deals your company wants to be selling. Look at this like, Armand. Like, let's say that you have a three k deal and they'd be a customer for five years as 15 of revenue, and you have to give away year one for free. So now you got 12 k on five years. So 12 k on five years is what? 2.4 k per year? That's like what? A 20% discount? So if you do a 20% discount in year one and you know how hard those discounts are to get back, you're basically netting out over five years the same if you just buy them out for year one and do $3 for years two, three, four, and five. It's the same over five years. And so, like, why piddle around with where the discount comes from? Let's just give them the full 20% upfront and then charge them full price after that, and then they're a very high margin customer. Mark, I'm curious. One of the things that you probably run into a lot is not just the commercial terms that we're talking about, but Catalyst is not a post IPO dinosaur 40 year old company with the product that hasn't changed in seventeen years. You all are innovating a ton. The product is constantly changing, and I'm sure there are customers who are asking you for new features or product guarantees as well as part of a deal. So do you have a different perspective, or how do you deal with the customers that are hoping to essentially make their deal contingent on certain products or features being delivered? That one's a lot trickier. Right? Because most product teams that I know are already booked up, and maybe the best of the best have surplus capacity reserve for just this kind of stuff. Most I find do not. And so anything that you agree to in a deal like that becomes a trade off for something else. And so, you know, that really awesome road map item might get pushed a quarter if you have to get this thing in to get this deal in. So listen. If you're in a small company, I think it's way easier. You know, you just go to your head of product. You go to your VP of sales. You have a very legit conversation about, is this revenue worth this kind of trade off? And if it is, you do the deal. If it's not, then you need to be okay and and walk them off of that. Right? This is what I found. Most deals that require product work, it's fringe stuff, and very rarely do they actually end up using the stuff you build. And so I would really push people on is what they want built keeping them from getting the result that they want or not. And show them how it's not because a lot of times it doesn't. And if it's critical, like, hey. They have to have this for workflow. Guess what that is? That's called a bad fit customer. And let's not sign up bad fit customers that just churn because we can, like, get the deal over the line with product work, and then we don't really understand what they want. They didn't really understand what they wanted. Then we built something. It's not quite worked. They churn anyway. Everybody's pissed about the deal you did. So, like, listen. I think one is if it's key workflow stuff that is, like, integral to how they do things, you probably just need to walk away. If it's fringe stuff, take a second and show them how, like, fringe stuff doesn't matter to probably getting the result that they want. It's just a preference. I always tell people, like, listen. Preference, project, and pain are not why people are buying right now. And they'll, oh my god. People buy and pain. No. They're not. I have a lot of pains. If somebody can solve for me, I wouldn't buy on right now. I don't care about your preference. Like, you might like to work this way. I don't care. I just need you to get the result. Right? And a project is something that is interesting, but not valuable enough for me. I have business initiatives that I gotta hit. If you show me how what you do helps my business initiative win, we're in. Let's talk. Let's figure it out. But most reps are selling at the project preference and pain level. And when you sell at that level, that's when your deal dies right at the end because the CFO is, like, not important enough for us to spend money on. So good. Mark, this has been phenomenal, but we're running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question. And so the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what's one bad habit you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? So a bad habit that I see a lot of people do is agenda and introduction to start a meeting. Let's say that you have a thirty minute meeting. I did some call reviews a couple years ago, lots of calls. Guess what the average time on a thirty minute call is spent on agenda and introductions? Six, seven minutes. Six to eight minutes. So if we got thirty minute meeting, we're spending 20 to almost 30% of that meeting on agenda and introductions. Like, what we don't have enough time to do anything, especially if you have to reserve the last five minutes for next steps. That means you got, like, twelve minutes to actually do stuff in the call. That's not enough time. So my suggestion is is if you have a team of people, you as a rep, introduce everybody, and you do it in, like, less than thirty seconds. And then you have your champion prepped, do the same exact thing. Let them go through and introduce all their people. And then on the agenda, send the agenda ahead of time and something. Make sure that everybody agrees to it in an email or just really quickly be like, hey. This is what we're gonna do this, this, and this. Nobody needs, like, five minutes to walk through an agenda. Just hit the items and let's get into it. Right? I'm telling you, 90% of buyers turn off when you tell them an agenda anyway. So, like, just be like, hey. We're gonna do a little more discovery. We're gonna show you a demo, then I'm gonna ask you for next steps. Alright. Let's hit it. Let me ask my first question and just hit it. So one, do all your introductions. Two, let your champion do all their introductions. And three, like, just let's move through the agenda side really quickly. What's in it for you? What's in it for me?

And lastly, number four, when a customer asks for new product guarantees in a contract, ask, is what you want built really preventing you from achieving the result that you want? Chances are it's not. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Folks, Armond is kidding. I did not actually thread my eyebrows, and no eyebrow has been shaved.
