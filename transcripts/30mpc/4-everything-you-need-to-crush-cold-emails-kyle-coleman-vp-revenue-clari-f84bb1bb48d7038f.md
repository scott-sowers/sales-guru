## Transcript

Good morning everybody and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes of Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farouk and I'm here with my co host Nick Sigelski. Today, we have a heck of an episode, a teardown on how to write good emails with Kyle Coleman. Kyle was previously the head of sales development over at Looker, and today, he is the VP of revenue growth and enablement over at Clari. Nick, why the heck should people listen? Well, Kyle takes us deeper than any guest has ever gone around subject lines, voice mail strategy, email formatting. This guy goes deep. If you're looking to get better with your outbound messaging, especially around email, you gotta listen to this one. Let's do it. Three, two, one. Roll it. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Kyle. Welcome to the show. We are really excited to talk with you today. We start every single show with your top three actionable sales tips. So let's get your three. What's number one? Alright. Number one, you have to build your muscle for personalization. It's I know there's a lot out there about what personalization is, but a pretty easy rule to live by is what I call the five by five by five rule. And what this means is you do five minutes of research on a person or on an account. You find five pieces of information, five insights about that person or account. And then you spend five minutes writing that message. And what this allows you to do is it allows you to actually scale personalization because you're taking the time once to do all the research that you need to do in order to write a whole series of personalized outreach. So five by five by five. Five minutes of research, five insights, five minutes of writing. Do it all over again. Love it. What's number two, Kyle? Number two, a Chris Voss special. You have to get comfortable in any sales role, STR, inside sales, enterprise sales. Get comfortable mirroring. This is when you're handling an objection. Just repeat the last few words that the prospect just said to you. Repeat it back to them. So when they say, you know, I'm not interested, just say, not interested, and see what happens. It's incredible when you just mirror those last couple words and just shut up and allow them to talk, the amount of information that they will give you. So get comfortable mirroring. Love that one. Round us out. What's number three, Kyle? Number three. Time is your most precious asset. And if you want to get something done, you have to schedule it. Like, use your calendar to actually schedule your days out. Take it seriously and then abide by those blocks that you set for yourself. And if you need a little methodology for prioritization, there's something called the Eisenhower matrix that Dwight d Eisenhower, former president, Nick for your edification, that he used in order to prioritize how he went about doing things. And it's this simple two by two grid where you chart things by how important they are and how urgent they are. And that will help you determine, is this something you do yourself? Is this something you schedule for later? Is this something you delegate to somebody else? Or is this something that you just completely don't do because it's not important and it's not urgent? So don't be busy for the sake of being busy. Be busy and also be productive, and you have to do that with intent. Kyle, that was a phenomenal top three. That was one of the best ones we've had. I wanna dig into this five by five by five thing because it's really quite interesting. So I'm listening to this. I'm hearing it. I've written it down. How do I actually go out and put this into practice? I need to open up my Salesforce. I'm looking at my accounts. Like, can you walk me through the gritty details around that, like, what that looks looks like? Yeah. For sure. It depends a lot on what the person reveals about themself on various social channels. And I'm not just talking about LinkedIn either. I'm talking about Twitter. I'm talking about Facebook, whatever you can find on a person. Some people are are more forthcoming about their personal life than others. So if you can find literal personal things about them, like, you can't spell personalization without personal. If you can find personal things about that person, where did they grow up? What sports teams are they fans of? What charities do they care about? If you can find things about them and then gear your opening parts of your written communication via email or LinkedIn or whatever it is around those things, that's the key to the castle. That's what's differentiated. My definition of personalization is that you couldn't send that same message to another person, and it still makes sense. If you can abide by that rule, then you've actually created a personalized message. One of the tricks you can use, I believe both Outreach and SalesLoft have this functionality, is you can go and see as you're dialing somebody, you can pull up the last email that you sent them. And if you've done a good job of layering your tailoring in each email, you can be like, boom. In my last email, I called out the fact that you have a Corgi, Kyle. Right? And so you can constantly have the emails mirror the voice mails, which is another thing you talk about a lot. Right? Yeah. That's exactly right. Like, personalization is also meant to be done in every channel that you're using in your outreach. So a lot of people think, well, I'm just gonna I'll I'll write the personal email, but I'm just gonna leave the same templated voice mail. And that's a big mistake. Like, you want your messaging to be consistent across all the channels that you're using. So the voice mails that you leave talk about the same bits of research that you uncovered. Make it personal about them. Same is true with, like, the videos that you send. Use all that research in all the different channels that you're pursuing, and that maximizes the familiarity that they have with you and maximizes their chance of responding. So we haven't talked about voice mail strategy a ton because everyone wants to get into, like, the gritty cold call. Right? And so what is your voice mail strategy? How does your first, second, third voice mail change? And then what does it actually sound like? How do you layer in tailoring into your voice mails? Very similar to an outbound email. In fact, if you've written a good outbound email, you should be able to just read it, and it makes sense to be a voice mail. It should be short. It should be no fewer or no more than about a 125 words is sort of the rule of thumb That translates to somewhere between thirty and sixty seconds of talk time, and you should put your personalization upfront in that email. So before introducing yourself or what you do, you should let them know why you're calling and try and make sure that you get that personalization in first because they're probably gonna not listen through the whole thing if you lead with whatever it is about yourself first. Gotcha. And so how many voice mails do you typically leave? Do you leave on every single time, or is there a certain cadence you have there? The intent of leaving voice mails is not to get a callback all the time. It is a piece of the familiarity of the awareness pie. And so why I always encourage people to leave a voice mail the first time they call for sure, because so many people now are not gonna answer the phone when they don't know who's calling. And so if you call them and you leave a voice mail, very likely that they'll either listen to voice mail or they'll at least view the transcript that's on their iPhone and it gets transcripted. So that's nice. Don't leave a voice mail every time, though. You you you just don't have time for that. I would say maybe alternate is is kind of the guidance that I give where one time you leave a voice mail, the next time you don't, the next time you do and you you go that route. Yeah. We tested something really similar where I think what we've landed at is a max of three voice mails. Because if you've left, like, seven voice mails, eventually, it's like you're just wasting your time talking to yourself. But the first one, we would do exactly what you're talking about where we would lead with context and we would stop. And so if our prior trigger was we work with a number of similar portfolio companies in the health care space, We literally pick up the phone, basically say that, and say call me back without doing the whole pitch. Fifteen seconds. Just get the context because they're like, oh, that's interesting. And then they'll go look at your email. And then the next voice mail, you can do the full pitch. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. A tactic that worked really well for me was the my follow-up email after I left a voice mail, the subject line is voice mail. That's it. So subject line voice mail, a line or two about, hey. Just give you a call. Must have missed you. Insert your personalization again. Hoping to catch you sometime soon. That's it. Huge open rate, huge response rate. And, again, the goal of leaving a voice mail is not necessarily only to get a callback. It's to show them that, like, hey, man. I'm not gonna leave you alone until you respond to me one way or the other. So I'm coming at you from all these different channels. Like, please give me a response. Yeah. On that note, can you talk a little bit about subject lines? Because I've been trying to strike the right balance between getting opens and replies, but also not being spammy. I know I can be super spammy and put something weird in the subject line and get it open, but I wanna come across as, like, a relevant business professional. But I also need to get replies. What's your strategy around subject lines? I abide by the rule that subject lines and the first lines of your email should be working in tandem with one another. And the reason for that is because every single email client now will preview both the subject line as well as the first line or two. It's about 25 words of your email. And so you want your subject line to be as short as possible so that you can maximize the real estate for that first line of your email which is personalized. Right? The kind of guidance that I give is your subject lines. And this takes practice. This takes time, and it takes a little bit of, of chutzpah here to pull off. But subject lines between one and three words is, like, kind of the gold standard for what you're trying to do. And if you can have that subject line bleed into the first line of your email, you're in really good shape. What do you mean by that? Armand, you you mentioned that I have a Corgi. And so something I think probably one of the best personalized emails I've ever gotten was for a competitor of Outreach and of SalesLoft, and their subject line was small but mighty. And I was like, what is that all about? And I saw the the initial the first line in their email was, like a Corgi, we are small but mighty when we're going up against giants like x y z. And so it bled into the things that their value prop, their positioning, its competitors, as well as things that are personal to me. And so if you can find a way to do that, that's kind of the key to the castle to get people to open and engage. So that's helpful because my issue with the personalization thing has always been like, hey, Armond. You went to USC. Fight on. By the way, I wanna sell you business intelligence software. He's like, these don't connect, and it's like, to me, that seems alright. Like, you just did this to get my attention. So this person did something different. They blended the personalization with the message. Is that what you're having your teams do? Yeah. It's what we call the segue. And mastering the art of this segue, first of all, very hard, and second of all, very useful. So I see a lot of advice from other sorts of people on LinkedIn where they're really inelegant about the way they transition from that personalized bit of research to their value prop where, like, they'll make a suggestion that says personalized line goes here, and then here's how you segue. Here comes the annoying sales pitch, and that drives me crazy. Like, I just think that's such a waste of time because it's it's unprofessional. It's not smooth. It's just another sales pitch. So if you can take the time to really think about your value prop and you can be creative about the way you transition into that value prop, that is what will differentiate you. It's hard to do, and that's what makes you stand out from the crowd. That's what the Corgi thing did is look, the fact that you have a Corgi has absolutely nothing to do with sales automation. But I got a similar email that was, I was a college wrestler, and and Nick and I were actually on the same team. And the guy's title was wrestling with your reps. I'm like, what the was that? And so I opened it, and he was talking he, like, had a picture of me wrestling, and he was like, you ever try to wrestle your reps into hitting the phones and they're just, like, not making their cold calls? I know what that's like, man. And he did such a good segue. That ability to not just say, like, boom. You're a college wrestler. We sell cold calling tools and tie it together. Like, that's an art, and that's difficult. But when it's done well, man, it stands out. I remember every single email like that. Exactly. When it's seamlessly done, it makes a huge difference. And, again, it makes you stand out. And so we've to kind of build this muscle on our sales team and with our SDR team, we templated a few different ways that you can segue based on different tactics that we were running. So we ran a direct mail campaign back before everybody was working from home and could actually direct mail people without being creepy and asking their home address. We would send people mugs, coffee mugs, from their alma mater. So this is a very scalable and very personalized way to do this outreach. And then the way that we segued in our messaging was that sales leaders like yourself are starting their days with coffee and with Clari. And one thing that's an important to note is a lot of people there are two polls. And one poll is like, you should start every email with dear or hello comma, and you should never even say hey. And then there's the other end of the spectrum that's like, I'm gonna send you the you're stuck under a rock and an alligator is about to eat you you email, and that's also horrible. Both of those are awful. And so what you're doing is you're still showing some personality. You're getting somebody to smile, but you're doing it through great research. And that's the perfect balance that I think a lot of reps fail to properly address. Right. Exactly. And I think a lot of reps also when they're starting, especially younger reps right out of college, I've found, feel this strange inclination to be way too formal in the way that they write and speak with people that are five years older than them making decisions at these companies. It's so strange. And then what I try and tell them is be professional always, but never feel like you have to be formal. You should be speaking to somebody like you would actually talk. And so another tip that I would give that I do give people is read your emails out loud before you send them. Like, literally, read them out loud. You're gonna feel like a crazy person, but you're working from home. Nobody can hear you anyway. Read them out loud. You'll find that a couple of things. One, you're very likely saying I way too much. If you hear yourself saying I more than you or I or we, you're doing something wrong. So eliminate those I's. But also use language that you would use when you're speaking. Because, again, if you write this email well, it's not just an email. It's also it can become your voice mail script and it can become all these things, and it should be you and the way that you speak. So I think it's a really useful tip. Like, talk to them like you'd talk to them at happy hour, not like you're a formal in a bank and you're afraid and you're trying to get a loan. So the same thing applies. I mean, you see us texting back and forth all the time, and these are really organic messages. And one of the things we talk about too is, like, if you ever remember, like, that massive wall of text that you got from your crazy ex, that it shows desperation. And so your emails should look very similar. They should be short. They should be conversational. And so, Kyle, you put some great content out there. And one thing that is particular about your content is it's extremely intentionally formatted. And so do you have any tips around how you actually format or structure an email from the body standpoint? Yes. For sure. So I mentioned it before, but a 125 words is the limit. And way easier said than done. 125 words. And the reason for that is because so much consumption now is happening on your mobile phone. And if it's less than mobile phone, I sound a 100 years old. When somebody's looking at your email on their phone, you get one scroll, and that's it. And if your message is more than a 125 words, you're gonna make them scroll a bunch of times, and you're gonna lose them. So a 125 word limit. And use white space. People who write I know, Armand, this is near and dear to your heart, but people who write huge blocks of text, why? Like, if it reads like a tome, like Moby Dick, like, nobody's gonna read it. The way that I think about things is separate thoughts go on separate lines. Every time you're making a different point or you're asking for something different or you want them to to read something new in your email, it should be on a new line that's separated with white space. And the reason for that is because the way that our brains work is we scan, we scroll. And so if you want them to see the key points of every message, you need to make it very easy for them to scan and consume and digest quickly. We've talked about subject line email, but we haven't talked about email to email. And so what's the spacing typically between calls and emails? How hard are you hitting someone? How many touches over how many days? What I try and do is I never send or think that it's wise to send people more than two written messages per week. I think that's just landed on a little too thick. Typically, what we'll do is we'll do a email on day one. I always like to email first before calling. I don't think in this day and age it's ever wise to do any, like, literal cold calling. I think you can always manufacture warmth in some way. So what we do to manufacture this warmth is we send the first email. It's educational. It's It's content driven. Very light call to action. Just, hey. Putting Clari on your radar. Here's a piece of content that sales leaders like you find interesting. And then we'll go on LinkedIn and stalk them in a very friendly way, trying to see what they're posting, what they're all about, engaging with some of their content in a genuine way, genuinely engaging with content, and then making a call either on the same day as that first email or on the next day, then following up the email three to five days later as a chain, as a thread to that first note. And that I know it sounds super simple, but we have I think the email that we send that gets the best response rate is that second email that's threaded to the first, and all it is is one word, thoughts, question mark. Thoughts? That's good. Yeah. And we get a huge, huge response rate to that. And this is, again, the way you scale your personalized outreach. You've already written a personalized email. That's your first touch. It's content driven. It's a light ask, and you're following up with thoughts. Thoughts? And just see what they have to say. And then you kinda repeat that cadence as you go. No more than two written pieces of correspondence per week between email and LinkedIn is kind of my general rule of thumb. It could go up to three, but I definitely know more than three. Yeah. It's other than that, it's just spamming people. But it's such an interesting point because we have the exact same thing where the second email, for whatever reason, it just pops the reply rate. And it's something especially salespeople tend to appreciate it. You guys are selling into sales leaders. And so I've I've had people that I've been reaching out to for the podcast. When I follow-up two or three times, they're like, oh, that's what I like to see, and then they get on. There's something about that psychology of, like, okay. This person's actually trying to get in touch with me. One other thing that we didn't talk about is the the layering in of LinkedIn connections and touches, and you've obviously got this big brand now. And so are your reps using LinkedIn messaging or InMails at scale, or do you find that that takes too much time? Absolutely. Yes. They are using them, but not for every prospect. This is a whole new rabbit hole that I'm opening up here, so forgive me. But we segment our prospects into what we call above the line and below the line. Above the line prospects are ones that have decision making authority, typically. Normally, that tracks pretty tightly with seniority. Below the line, people we still wanna speak with and they're still important, but they probably don't have decision making authority. They're use case champions. They may be influential, but ultimately, they're not gonna be the one sign in the deal. And so we focus all of everything that we've talked about so far, all of the personalization, we focus entirely on folks who are above the line. For the folks that are below the line, we understand their day to day more. We know their pains. We know how Clari helps solve those pains. And so the automated stuff that's going out to them is very much applicable versus the higher level people that are more senior, who have less day to day type things that we understand, who have more of a strategic vision, who are tighter with the corporate strategy. So we need to understand what the company is trying to do so that we can message around what both what the company is doing and what that sales leader is doing at that company. So that was a bit of an aside, but all of the LinkedIn messaging that we're doing is for those people who are above the line. And, again, same sort of thing, like one LinkedIn message or connection request per week roughly as it relates to the rest of the kind of outbound cadence that we have going. A lot of people forget that. They'll ask how much do you tailor your emails or how much time do you spend researching. And there's there's not one answer because if it's a bottom tier prospect, then you don't have a lot of time. It's the golden prospect that's your $10,000,000 deal. You're gonna send them some really, really good stuff. And so I love how you guys are tiering that out too. Yeah. And the kind of the rule of thumb or the guidance that we give the team is that you should roughly, roughly, this is gonna change for every company, but I would suggest if any sales or SDR leaders are listening, you should have guidance for how many prospects you have actively cadenced or sequenced at any time. If you as a sales or SDR team or leader are using Outreach or SalesLoft, you have to give your team guidance on how many prospects they should have actively engaged. So we give guidance that you should have somewhere between 800 and a thousand people actively engaged at all times. And roughly 15 or 20%, let's call it 20, of those people should be above the line. So those are the kinda 150 to 200 people that you're paying really close attention to, that you're executing these high touch tactics against, and the rest of them are automated and are happening in the background. So if we back that out, you talked about blocking your calendar effectively. And to get that many, it's not like on day one, boom, 800. And now let me just hit it for the next three weeks. Right? And so how do you suggest reps block their calendar so that their prospecting time is aligned with those targets? We are very intentional about the ramp time that we give new SDRs and new salespeople. And the ramp that we build is very much a learn by doing ramp schedule. So throughout the course of their ramp, they're spending time shadowing top performers. They're spending time with their managers, and they're doing the work. They're building their prospect list without doing any outreach. They're just building that prospect list. Then every week from there on out, we have an expectation that you're adding new 50 to a 100 new leads at the top of your funnel so that as people weed themselves out, you're constantly keeping yourself refreshed to avoid the peaks and valleys that would otherwise come from you doing everything at once and then running out of people to to contact and then having to totally refill the pipe. So, Kyle, we could go on for hours and hours and hours about prospecting, but this is by far the most we've gone into cold emailing tactics out of any guest that we've had. And so we've talked about a lot of good habits out there, but we always like to talk about things that we need to stop doing right away. And so if there is one thing that every sales rep needed to stop doing right now, what would that be? Stop making calls for the sake of making calls or doing any sort of metric for the sake of the vanity metric. If you are doing anything, making calls, sending emails, any part of your job that's just for the sake of looking good on a dashboard, you are not thinking. And this role, SDR, inside sales, sales in general, is so much more strategic than it used to be that you owe it to yourself to carve out time for that strategy, for that quality oriented, research driven outreach. Anything you wanna leave with the audience before we sign off? No. No. This has been great. If anybody ever has any questions, like, please feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to talk shop. Alrighty, guys. And definitely go follow Kyle on LinkedIn. He posts some really, really entertaining stuff. And everyone hang on for a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Your top four takeaways for the episode with Kyle Coleman include number one, five by five by five rule. Five minutes of research to find five insights on the person or account, and then write your message in five minutes or less. Number two, use the white space in your emails and have one idea per line. Make the structure of the email and the tone conversational. Don't be a robot. Number three, keep your emails short. If you have to scroll more than once or if an email is over a 125 words, fix it. Don't write essays. And then number four, have your emails reference your voice mails, and have your voice mails reference your emails. Tailoring is not just for the emails. It's for every single part of the sales cycle. And so, Nick, how can people help us out?
