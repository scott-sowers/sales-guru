## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Cugelski. And today, we have an absolutely stellar principal account executive over at Dialpad. Her name's Marissa. Nick, why should people listen? I particularly liked this episode because the second half of the conversation, we talked a lot about team selling with a sales engineer, and most of my career was spent working with a sales engineer. That person will make or break your ability to hit quota. If you can get your sales engineer to be an asset for you as opposed to a liability, you're gonna kill it. Marissa will teach you how. Three, two, one. This episode will also be an asset for you. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox, And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook. Nook is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Marissa. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Okay. The first one is prioritizing your pipeline. I know so many reps that are just focused on all the wrong things. So your time is super valuable. A couple of factors that I take into consideration are, first, the deal size. Obviously, the larger the ACB, the more time you should focus on that deal. Second is timing. Are they looking to purchase within the next month or quarter? If so, that needs to be at the top of your priority list. Third is product fit. Right? Making sure that the features that they're asking for, the capabilities are in line with what your product offers. And lastly, a strong champion. Can the person that you're working with go in and sell your product internally? So take a look at all those four things. If all four of them are in play, make that deal at the top of your priority list. Beautiful. What's number two? Number two is ranking the buyer's priorities after every disco call or discovery slash demo, depending on how you run your sales process. This just makes sure that you are focused on all the right things. This also gives them a chance to edit those priorities if you missed one and get you can get some buy in. Right? So moving forward, when you do a second demo, when you put together pricing, when you loop in some other team members, everyone's on the same page and you're focused on all the things that matter to them. Wonderful. What's tip number three? Okay. So tip number three is just to understand the buying process early. This just puts you in a better position, so there's no gotchas later on. So understand their budgeting cycle, their budgeting process, who the decision maker is, who the signer is because those two might be different. And then also, if they've purchased another software in the past, what were the terms? Is it a longer agreement? Can they do annual payment quarterly? Understanding these things will just eliminate risk later on in the deal. Awesome. So Marissa, talking about the buying process, I've seen this go really poorly where some people first call, first five minutes, they're banting someone over the head. And that's probably not how you're doing it. But the other terrible thing to do is not cover this until the sixteenth call. And so I'm curious, when and how do you go about uncovering the buying process and figuring out if your champion knows how to buy software? So it really just depends on how quickly they're moving and who the buyer is. I've done this on the first call. If it makes sense and they're looking to move by the end of the month, I'm saying, hey. I wanna get you the best pricing possible, but I need to understand the terms and who you're taking a look at. Right? Because sometimes there's competitors in play. So it's more of like, how can I help you? And then there's other deals that, you know, they're not making a decision for another six months. So I won't bring this up until pricing comes into play, which might be on the third call after I've already done a discovery call, a demonstration, and then we do a scoping slash pricing call where we get everything out on the table. But listen to your gut. If you feel like it's too early to be talking about pricing and it gets kinda awkward, you're probably bringing it up at the wrong time. So a lot of times, we're talking to folks who don't have a very clear event, meaning, like, you need to buy this software by this date, what have you. A good example is we have a lot of friends over at Gong where typically it's not like you need Gong today versus tomorrow. It's just a general pain point. And so how do you go about finding things that you can use to hold people to some sort of timeline as opposed to like an arbitrary, we sort of want to get this thing done at some point? Doctor. Yeah. You have to really dig into their pain and help quantify. So if there is something, for example, like for our phone system, if they're like an on an on premise solution, they're paying a lot of money for equipment, and also they have to, like, go through the vendor to make changes to their call routing treatment or add users, that could take anywhere from a week to two weeks. So that's losing time. And within our system, you can make those changes automatically. So you're trying to, like, actually quantify the pain and put that in front of them so it's more compelling for them to make a change. Obviously, the more pain points you can find, the more compelling you get. One thing that I oftentimes find is helpful is some of the things you mentioned earlier on, Marissa, is every rep should have their stack rank of time line drivers. And number one on the list is oftentimes current vendor expiring. Right? And then the next one might be, I don't know, if there were some period in which telecom companies were all making their purchasing decisions. And then another period might be an audit. And then you start getting to the softer ones, which are maybe you have a batch of new hires or a new product release. And then the final ones are related to pricing and commercial terms. But I find that oftentimes sellers try to throw the discount at the buyers as the first thing when the problem isn't price. The problem is that their buying window isn't even for the next nine months. And so I guess my question for you is, Marissa, let's say we land on one of those timelines. Right? Let's say that we land on a six month timeline. One of the things that you talk a lot about is how you're really good with sales process. How do you chop up the sales cycle over six months to keep them engaged? Or in other words, what are the key steps that you know your buyers need to go through in order to complete a complex purchase? Yeah. And that's why I said to figure out their buying process early on because this might include security review or an RFP or an RFI or, you know, going through the BAA or MSA. So I build all of that into a mutual action plan, and I actually walk through it with the buyer. And I say, hey. How long does your legal process typically take? They're like, we say two weeks, but it actually ends up being a month. I'm gonna sit and I say, okay. Let's allocate four weeks for that. Who's in charge of that? Great. So I actually, like, walk them through step by step what the ideal buying process will be. Let's do a demonstration. Sometimes I need to do a POC. That can take anywhere from two weeks to a month. So I start to lay out all the different steps. And a lot of the times, it takes up four to six months, and it perfectly aligns with the timeline that we've agreed upon. And so I'm curious. You talk about digging into the buying process early on. And then from there, you're essentially mapping out all of these steps. How are you keeping track of all of these steps? Are you using a JEP? Are you using a map? And I guess, how are you keeping this long sales cycle on track so it doesn't wander for six months? Yeah. So a lot of the times, like, on most calls, I'll have a a deck of the agenda. I'll have some slides if we're going through specific features or, like, POC success criteria. And at the end, I'll include my mutual action plan. Here's where we are in our mutual action plan. Here are the steps that we still need to complete. After the call takes place, I'll even do a recap email. Here's what we covered on today's call. Here's what we still need to cover. Another thing is I sell primarily with partners. I keep the partner on the same page as well. Here's what we've accomplished. Here are the last three things that we need to do. For the last three things that we need to do, there's been times where we're doing an MSA red lines, and I'm like, currently in review, we'll have back to you by end of week. So just, like, over communicate just so everyone's on the same page. You don't want anyone to just say, oh, I just didn't know what was going on. So we didn't do anything for the last two weeks, and we just wasted all that time. Can you talk to me about the experience of selling alongside partners? Because I've worked in sales where, like, a consultant will be helping the company make the purchasing decision, or there's an implementer that they've worked with before that also implements our thing, and so they're sort of helping with the sale or there's a channel partner. Can you talk me through sort of two things? One, areas that people commonly screw up in working with partners, and then maybe the inverse of that, what I should be doing instead? Yeah. So I think the first thing is every partner is different. They have different preferences. So sync with the partner before you ever meet with the client. And I just say, hey. How do you wanna run this deal? And sometimes the partners say, do not communicate with the client. You need to go through me for everything, scheduling, relaying back information, relaying pricing. So just understand how they wanna work off the bat. So I think understanding preferences first, include them on every single email thread, Make sure they're included on all the invites as well. And then talk about pricing before you deliver it because there's been times where, like, partners' commission is tied to the pricing as well. So if you go in and discount her offer terms that they probably wouldn't have agreed upon, run that by them first. And there's been times where I I had to give, like, a free month or do a shorter contract length where it affects their commission, but they're just happy that I respected them and went to them first and asked for permission before I did that. So, again, over communicate with your partners. Marissa, you made two interesting points there that I found would work for me is, one, figure out what is important to the partner. You said figure out their preferences. We often sit down with our buyer and we say, what does great look like? Like, what does success look like for your project or initiative and replacing your telecom stuff? But if you actually think about it, if you have a partner that already has a relationship with the client, like, you also wanna figure out, okay. You're bringing me in. Partner, what does great look like for you here? Like, how do you want me talking about you or presenting my thing? And they will often tell you, hey, this is what great looks like for me bringing you into this relationship. And oftentimes when a partner brings you in, if you can make the partner happy, you're gonna be good because they can sell internally for you. So don't forget, you have to figure out what is important to them. The other thing you talked about was, like, the pricing thing, and I wanna talk to you in a second about, like, how you actually deliver pricing because I know you have some good stuff. But something I found is oftentimes partners think they know what your pricing looks like because they've been in the industry for a long time, and they miscommunicate that to the client. They're like, oh, they're super cheap or here's their model. And, like, that stuff changes. And so you're right. It's important that you have a candid conversation with them around, like, here's how we're structured. Yeah. So if I'm sending over a quote to the client, I'll set up time with the partner, like, fifteen minutes, and I'll say, here's the quote. And I'll go line item by line item because we have different license types. Right? And different we have toll free numbers, room lines, professional services. I have to explain why they're paying that amount for our implementation team to come in and help them. Also, there's, like, special terms because there's usage involved. So I I will go in and review it with the partner, and I'll send it to them, and I'll recap kinda, like, the main bullet points because I don't want them to deliver pricing wrong if they've asked if they wanna deliver pricing to the customer. That's more of like a consultant partner. One other partner I'll talk about is like a technology partner. I worked with Google at my last company, and I co sold with them. And it was more of like a marketing attribution, like Google Ads measurement. So we actually met every week. We had a call to measure the results of the POC that we were running side by side. And it was just us, myself, and Google. So that every time we met with a customer, we were on the same page with the metrics that we were tracking and the lift that we are providing them. So different partners require different ways that you interact with them. But I do if it is a large deal, which this was, meet with a partner on, like, a a weekly or biweekly basis. So, Marissa, I'm curious. Independent of a partner, you've mentioned a couple times that you're gonna try to almost, like, test your prospect by giving price early. Can you give me a sense of, like, how you go about doing that and why? Yeah. So the question everyone gets on, like, every disco or demo is, I need pricing. Okay. Don't send pricing blindly and say, sure. Great. I'll send you an email with the pricing details, and, let me know if you have any questions. That's the worst thing to do. Say, hey. Actually, pricing because for us, it's on our website. Pricing's on our website. Here's what it typically costs for a contact center seat or one of our back office users. Gauge their reaction. They might say, oh, wow. You're way more expensive than this competitor, or, oh, we're only spending this much. That's where I pivot and I say, hey. That's just our list pricing. Depending on how quickly you can move forward, payment terms, other concessions, like, I can definitely work with my finance team to get pricing in a better spot for you. But if you don't test them and gauge their reaction, you're gonna come in blind and probably get ruled out right away just because you were ignorant and didn't know what was going on. I will ask them too and just be super blunt. What are you currently paying for your current provider? If during the demo, they noted that they don't have x, y, and z with that current provider, that's an option for you to come in on a higher rate because they're getting more value. So I think it never hurts to ask. Ask what they're currently spending. Ask what they've budgeted. Ask what the other competitors have come in at. I've even asked for competitor quotes, and they've sent them to me. And then I send them to finance and say, hey. This is what this competitor came in at. Can we match, or can we come close? You know, one area I've struggled with this, and I wanna hear how you voice this over, is the same situation where I'm talking to a customer about their system that they bought in 1993, and there's 42 different things that, like, don't work with it that they articulated in our discovery call. And then they anchor me on the fact that they pay 20% of what my quote is. And what I don't wanna do is say to the customer, well, you're an idiot. Your thing sucks, and, like, that's why you're paying less. So, like, how do I artfully call out to the customer, hey. The reason that you're paying less is that your thing ain't that good. Yeah. I've dealt with that same kinda situation. And I will even just say, like, hey, a lot has changed since the nineteen nineties, and, like, our solution is a lot more modern. Here are all the additional features and functionality you're gonna get with our system. I understand that you don't wanna pay five x as much, but can we meet in the middle where you're still paying more, but you can get this approved by your finance team? You have to do it that way, but also understand which vendors they're looking at. Because for us, we're a cloud based phone system, but there's also on premise systems. So if he's looking at an on premise system and looking at us, it's not an apples to apples comparison, and our pricing models are just, like, completely different. So I will also try to understand, like, the competitive landscape so that they are making side by side comparisons from a cost perspective. It's funny because this happens in almost every single new software company. If you work for a startup or a growth stage company is there are almost always these legacy players in your space, these players who have been around since, like, MS DOS and Windows '95. And a good example is at Pave, one of the key things that differentiates us is we essentially integrate with all of your HR systems so you don't have to do the work of uploading data into Pave. Right? But a lot of the legacy players don't do that, and they're 20% of our price, Literally, like, a fraction. And one thing that I find is really, really helpful is instead of trying to convince someone off the bat, I'll actually try to push them to that model and be like, the folks who want to pay 20 k versus 80 to a 100 k are the folks who are okay doing that work, and they're not really concerned about manager experience. And that might be you, right, because you wanna take money out of that model, and you have a big enough team to do all that on your own. Are you comfortable doing that on your own? And then put it on them to get them to push back and say, no. There's a reason that we're talking. And then, Marissa, to your point, you then start to quantify, okay. Well, then how much is that worth to you above that 20 k? Marissa, one of the things that you put in the prep doc that I'm curious around your intention behind is when you give any sort of concession, you are attaching a valid through or valid expiration date on that thing. Can you explain to me the strategy behind that? And then two, how you are pointing that out to the customer or calling their attention to it? So let's just say you've negotiated a deal. You gave them a special term that you usually don't give. Maybe you'd made some adjustments to the SLA. You got them really awesome pricing. Hey. This is only approved for this quarter. This pricing is no longer valid after July 31. So when I send over the pricing proposal or the quote, I'll say the pricing's valid through 07/31/2022. That way, they know that they're gonna lose that pricing if they don't move forward by the date that we agreed upon. And there's been times where my prospects are like, shoot. Like, we need to rush to get this done or else I'm gonna lose this great pricing. I just blame blame it on finance. That's just the way that our company functions. Every quarter, we have to go back and seek approvals. And I just got a new CFO. I don't think this pricing is gonna get approved next quarter. And when I present the pricing, I, like, bold it and put it, like, right in front of them so that there's no confusion, and they're aware that the pricing will no longer be there by that time. I mean, what you're doing takes it takes, like, just this tiny amount of discipline where I always feel like the deals that I don't need this for are the ones where they end up biting me or I'm like, oh, I wish I had put that because you're right. If you say, hey. This is valid through July 4, and then something happens, the deal blows up, and you're passed then, you can always go back. If you feel like, okay, you do need to honor that earlier discount in order to, like, get the deal done. Otherwise, it's gonna not happen. You have that option. But if you don't set an expiration date, now you're backpedaling. So you actually have absolutely nothing to lose by just making it a standard practice. Anytime you make any sort of concession, put a expiration date on it because now you are the one who is in control. Especially for deals that don't have a critical event, like a renewal date or contract expiration date, there's just a compelling event. If they think they're gonna get that pricing indefinitely, they're just gonna keep pushing. And your forecast calls are gonna be really embarrassing because you're committing a deal that has no urgency. I had a deal recently where I had pricing valid through the end of the month, and then there are some changes in the org. Right? There were layoffs. So she went back to me, and she said, I'm so sorry. I promised you I'd sign by this day, but we just laid off 20% of our workforce. And our management team said if there's a freeze for the next week, and I said, hey. Thanks for letting me know. I'll get an extension to have this pricing approved for another two weeks. Does that give you enough time? She goes, yes. She signed it. Two weeks later, it pushed. But at least she knew where she stood, and she knew that I was gonna have to go back to my team to get approval. So what do you do when it pushes out and they miss their deadline, but then they want the same price? If there's a valid reason, I'll honor the pricing. But if it's just because they, like, wanna drag their feet, I think you need to be disciplined and say, hey. If this goes past this date, we need to go back to, like, $65 a seat versus the 60 that you have now. One of the things that I find is really, really helpful is if you can handle this conversation upfront as opposed to after the fact, it is key because you talked about understanding the buying process early. And I find that the best sellers will before giving the discount and asking for an end of month commitment, they unpack all the steps that need to happen. Is security gonna be done? Is legal gonna be done? Is this gonna be done? Is that gonna be done? On that basis, you have all control to get this done by end of this month, end of this quarter. Agreed? Agreed? Yes. Awesome. That's a mutual agreement. If we don't, I'm looking you eye to eye right now. You need to know that there's no way that I'm gonna be able to keep this, and my finance team is gonna hold me to it. But a lot of people, they just give the discount, and they're like, oh, please sign it by the end of the month, and they'll be like Yes. The buyer says something like Crossing my fingers. Think I'm gonna get it done. It should be okay. And then when they push, they're like, oh, no. You lose your discount. And that's how you lose the deal entirely and never get it back again because people are pissed off at you. Yeah. And another thing I do is, like, I'll move my manager or director onto some of these pricing and negotiation calls, good cop, bad cop, have them deliver that. Right? So that I remain the good cop and say, hey. It's totally out of my control. This is my director. It's coming from the top. It's probably one of my favorite things to do is my reps love blaming things on me for better or for worse. And so I'm, like, perpetually the bad guy. And the other thing is they tend to do a really good job of folks oftentimes are, like, matching power with power. I'm curious. Are there other things that you're doing from a team selling standpoint that are worth noting throughout your buying process, whether that means when you get access to power or whether you're going through technical validation or you're going through a negotiation? When are you pulling in key members of your team into your sales cycle? Yeah. So my sales engineer, right, is with me a lot of the time for demonstrations. I always say at the beginning of the call, like, he is your technical resource. Like, that's his lane. Especially when it comes to scoping, I'll loop in sometimes my, like, director of professional services because his team's ultimately gonna be the one implementing the team. For some legal calls, depending on how many red lines there are, I might loop in our legal counsel and just set up a call so that we're not going back and forth via email. Typically, a call can resolve most of the outstanding items within, like, an hour versus, like, wasting two weeks on it. And then my director and manager, I'll loop in for those negotiation calls. And sometimes earlier on, if they bring in, like, their CIO or, like, a CEO on some of the later demos. But definitely aligning power is good, so there's executive sponsorship. Can you talk to me a little bit about the prep for your sales engineer? Because in the jobs I've worked where I've had a sales engineer, I found that that person makes or breaks the sale, and it's usually within my control as to what side of the line they end up falling on. Yeah. So I'm a firm believer that my sales engineer and I are a team. But before every single call, I will set up, like, fifteen to twenty minutes with him and go through what we're gonna cover on that call, the agenda. He might make tweaks and say, let's not cover that on this call. We only have an hour. We can't get to it. We're gonna run out of time. I said, okay. Great. After this discovery call, sometimes I have questions. I'm like, hey. Like, how does this integration work or how does this use case work? Let's flush that out on a call between us so that when we go to the customer, we're not still confused. He might say, hey. Could we get these three questions answered? Be like, great. Let's do that. I go through an executive summary slide, which is recapping their current state, their challenges, and their goals. So I'll review that with the sales engineer. Also, go through, like, who's gonna be on the call and what's their personality like. I have some folks that are just, like, really serious evaluators, so I'll let the sales engineer know. They're not gonna laugh at your jokes. They're very serious. They're gonna ask, like, really pointed questions and cut you off. Just give them a heads up. Last but not least, tell the sales engineer what you want the outcome to be. I wanna get buy in, and I wanna move to a POC. At the end of the call, that's our goal. We're gonna schedule a POC kickoff call. Make sure all of that's flushed out beforehand so that the call goes as smoothly as possible and that you continue to work towards the end goal. Can you talk about that tag team motion in the meeting with your SE? And the reason that I, I ask is I see a lot of folks pass it to their SE and then crack open a beer, put their feet up on the desk, and then maybe they even go off camera on Zoom, and they start answering other Slacks and emails. But there's probably a better way to do this and be more actively involved in the conversation to support your SE. Yeah. So there is a handoff. Right? You go through your slide deck. You you know, the AE hands it over to the SE. They say, hey. Can you see my screen? Stay engaged. During the demonstration, I will catch things that he might not since he's, like, handling so many different things or showing integrations. So So they're like, hey, Alton. Actually, I think what they meant is this. And he's like, oh, thank you so much for clarifying. Yes. Let me show you what that looks like within our call reporting. There's other times where he just answers questions, and I I'll go clarify. Hey. Actually, when he asked this question, what's, like, the context behind it? Like, are you asking it because he can't do that within your current system? Or, like, where is this coming from? Just, like, start to help him out by, like, figuring out more details or getting some clarification. And sales engineers are really smart, but they have five people asking them questions sometimes, and they might miss something, so steer them. And there's been times where, like, he actually jumps to something that's not super important to them, and I'll cut them off and say, hey. Actually, I think what they wanna see is, like, the reporting suite, and we can schedule, like, another time to go through the back end because, like, the IT manager's on the call. But I think you should stay engaged. Don't go off camera. I think staying on camera, like, forces you to stay engaged. Definitely don't eat or crack open something to drink because then you can't talk even if you wanna go off mute. Yeah. You have a couple of jobs when your sales engineer is demoing. Your first job is, to your point, to keep the call on track. And the reason you are well equipped to do that is because you're not demoing software and you know what they actually care about. So if people try to derail, you have the ability to be like, hey. This isn't actually related to the goal that you're hoping to accomplish. The second thing you also need to do is you need to bring back what you learned in discovery into the call because your sales engineer doesn't have that context. So use the fact that someone else is running the demo for you to insert stories. And then the last piece is to your point is, Marissa, you should be eyeballing that room like crazy. I actually love to blow up my Zoom gallery room while my SE is demoing and look at the people that I need to be engaged. And the moment you see someone multitasking or on Slack, pinpoint them and prick them with questions exactly to get them reengaged in the conversation. Another thing is when you have multiple people on a demo, I'll say, hey. You're running the demo. I'm gonna monitor the chat because there's questions coming through the chat. They're asking for documentation, more information about integrations. Also, like, I have Slack up during demos. So I'll ping them and be like, hey. Let's actually maneuver to this because that's more important to them so that you're not actually having to, like, on the call, call him out in front of everyone. Or I have his personal cell phone number, so I'll text him. But those are just good methods to, like, behind the scenes, make sure that you're all on the same page and focus on the right things in the demo. Marissa, that was probably the best riff that we've had on team selling with a sales engineer probably ever on the show. So thank you. We are running out of time, however, and we've gotta move ourselves to the very last question. And the last question is this. We've talked about a lot of great things salespeople should be doing. Now let's talk about the inverse. So the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibit that you think they need to break because it is hurting them more than it helps? Yes. I think when salespeople take a long time responding to emails, when you're making a prospect wait, like, few hours a day, they might take their business elsewhere. Just respond to them. They'll appreciate that so much more. And there's been times where I respond and say, hey. I read your email. I don't know the answer. I'm finding the answer. I'll let you know as soon as I get it. And they're like, thank you so much for being professional. I think a lot of the times that sales folks are mistaken, and they think they have to have all the answers right away before they respond. Just make sure that you're staying on top of it and make them feel special. Because a lot of the the sales process and the buying process is, like, do they like the sales rep and do they like their sales experience with that company? Beautiful. Marissa, thank you so much for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Marissa from Dialpad include, number one, at the end of that first discovery call, stack rank their top priorities and share them back with the prospect so you can spend 90% of your time there. Number two, give pricing early in your sales cycle and watch their reactions when you do it. And if you ever decide to give a concession, make sure there's an expiration date on it. Number three, don't eat a sandwich while your SE is demoing. It's on you to prep them. And then once the call starts, it's on you to keep the call on track. And then lastly, number four, my personal favorite way to do that is blow up the Zoom gallery view and constantly be watching all of the people on the call. And if someone starts multitasking, engage them with a question. Those are the four, Nick. How could people help us out here? Well, in previous how can people help us out episodes, I've asked folks to follow Nick and Armand on LinkedIn. But did you know we've got another asset on LinkedIn? It's our thirty minutes to presidents club company page. And why you might consider following that page is what we do is we take the very best stuff from Armand and the very best stuff from Nick, and we actually put it out on that page. So if you wanna get the best of Armand, the best of Nick, and the occasional sales tip, you might consider following thirty minutes to Presidents Club on LinkedIn. Thanks for listening, and we'll see you all next week on the show.
