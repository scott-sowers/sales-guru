## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. Today, we have a legend, John Barros, the host of the Make It Happen Mondays podcast and the CEO of Jay Barros sales consulting. Nick, why should people listen? John takes us through deal mechanics for when you're booking initial meetings and moving deals through your pipeline, and then he also talks about some tools so that you can have more pointed and productive discovery calls and demos. Alrighty, folks. We know JB is famous for prospecting, but we took it in a slightly different direction. So let's hit it. Three, two, one. Roll it. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost two deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, John. Welcome to thirty minutes to president's club. We start every show with three tactical tips. Let's get yours. Hi, Nick. Thanks for having me on here. So, yeah, three tactical ones. My favorite one, you can Google this. It's, Jay Barrow's blog favorite nugget. It helps, maintain control of meetings and, urgency. And the way it works is called the summary email. What you do is when you and I have a conversation today, right, it say you're trying to sell to me. It's not that I'm lying to you. It's just that as soon as we get off this phone, my boss comes in, changes my priorities, your competition comes in and change it. Right? So needless to say, three weeks later, it's like this conversation never happened. But if I ever documented, I got someone to hold you accountable. So the way it works and by the way, you have to let them know it's coming. So you at the end of the conversation, you say this. Hey. Thanks so much for your time today, Nick. I really appreciate it. There's some next steps and action items here. Before I go ahead and do all that, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna briefly summarize what I was able to gain from our conversation today. I'm I'm a send it over to you in a quick email. Could you do me a favor and email me back to let me know if it's all accurate and if I missed anything? You have to let them know it's coming. If you don't let them know it's coming, the response rates are pretty much zero. I have a 90% close ratio when I get a response. I have a 40% close ratio when I don't. So there's my favorite nugget. So here's my second tactical thing. You take that summary email, say that's on a Monday, and then you and I have a follow-up on Friday. Friday comes and goes and lo and behold, you don't show up. Right? Instead of Monday the next week, saying, touching base and checking in, so you know how the weekend went. What I do is I take that summary email, just reply all to it and say, hey, Nick. Not sure what happened on Friday. When you wanna reconnect? Do your typical follow-up. Okay? And do that three or four times. Okay? Call, hey. What's going on? You don't wanna reschedule. That type of stuff. And if they've straight ghosted you, then after three or four times of doing your basic, hey, what's going on? Take that summary email, you gotta keep replying all to it because you wanna show them that you've been coming out. Right? Like the third or fourth one after about two weeks of ghosting, you reply all and you change the subject line and you write in the subject line, still interested? And then when they open it up, type this, hey, Nick, could you do me a favor and let me know if you're still interested either way so I don't continue with unnecessary follow-up? And that's important. Either way, let me know either way so I don't continue with unnecessary follow-up, letting you know I'm going to continue with unnecessary follow-up if you don't respond. And then if you don't respond to that one, two or three days later, reply all to that and say, did I lose you? Reply all to it, erase the subject line, and just write in the subject line, did I lose you? Okay? And then when they open up this email, the signature file and the other five emails that you've sent them, don't write anything after that. That's a I get about a 90% no ghost rate. I get a 90% response rate with that email. It's not always positive. It's like fifty fifty, 50% positive, 50% negative. Right? But at least I get a response. So there's two, summary email and no ghost by doing the did I lose you email. The third one is I've been working from home for ten years. The daily routine is absolutely critical. Get up in the morning, get in your right mindset. Thankfully I have this Make It Happen shirt that I wear every day, right? I got a bunch of copies so it's not like I'm wearing the same shirt. And that's my mentality and then I leave the house, I go grab my dunks, I come back, but then I do my daily routine. And what it is is instead of checking my fantasy leagues, which are nonexistent anymore, or instead of checking the news, which gets me all pissed off, I set up my data feeds and I take my top 25 accounts, tier one accounts. I follow them all and their executives on LinkedIn sales navigator, owler, Facebook, and Twitter. So I go like all their accounts on Facebook. I go follow them all on Twitter and I set up Chrome so you'd auto load all the bookmarks. And those five bookmarks show up and including Feedly. So f e e d l y. It's a free resource. It's an RSS aggregator, and that's where I follow trends and topics of people who are smarter than me, and I read those. So those five tabs show up every single morning, and all I do is I scan through data feeds, and I find two or three things to fire off a really tailored email to say, hey. I saw this just happened, whatever that trigger was. Love to have a conversation. I read a few articles. I share a few things out on social, build my bigger brand, and I do that in an hour a day. So those are my three tactical, go do them, they'll work. You do something that a lot of sales reps try to do, but they don't do super well, and that's perception management in your sales cycle. And what you're doing with your recap emails and with your shared agendas is you're constantly testing whether or not they're seriously willing to move forward and if they're still bought into those problems. So why don't we start all the way from the beginning of a sales cycle and understand what are you doing from a perception management standpoint. Where does that start? Is it the first meeting agenda? Is it the shared agenda? I think it's the first cold call, man. Let's put it this way. I think life is about expectation setting. Right? I mean, think about the last time you were pissed off about anything. I almost guarantee it's because your expectations were misset. You know what I mean? Like, you drive into the office in the morning. At 07:00, you hit traffic. You don't like traffic, but you expect it. Right? When I used to be flying all around all over the place, I'd get home off of a red eye at 05:00 in the morning, and I live 10 miles north of the city of Boston. If I come out at 5AM driving north out of the city of Boston, I hit traffic at 05:00 in the morning, I'm rip roaring pissed off. Right? Because I wasn't expecting traffic. So I used to be a anti upfront contract guy, Sandler upfront contract guy. I thought it was the cheesiest thing I'd ever heard back when I was 22 years old. Gong data came in, some of the data said that the top reps use the upfront contract. I was like, So I started thinking about it and we're starting to leverage it now. So here's upfront contract on a call, expectation setting. Right? Hey, thanks for taking my call. You got a couple of minutes. Well, not really. Who is this? What do you want? This is John with JD sales. And the reason for my call today is blah blah blah. And I was just wondering if I could get ten to fifteen minutes on your calendar to have a conversation about that. Now you can say tomorrow at 03:00, but most of the time you're gonna say, well, you caught me now. What do you want? Here comes the expectation. I'm a I know you weren't expecting my call, so I'll be brief here. I got about three or four questions for you about your sales team and that type of stuff. And after that, I'll share with you the components of my solution that I think might be able to address that. And then from there, you could tell me whether it makes sense to take a deeper dive if you want. Now you do the, hey. I'm gonna send you the information, that type of thing. Now when somebody says send me information after that initial call call that you didn't go too too deep on, Right? Yeah. This sounds interesting. Why don't you send me information? Follow me next week. The most critical thing that any rep can get at any stage of the sales process is a defined next step scheduled on the calendar. So here it goes tactically. I'm on look. I'm thrilled to send you first of all, I go through the what, when, why process. What information would you like to see, when would you like to see it, and why? And when I say when, I usually preface it with, hey. Is it okay if I get it to you by the end of the week, right, or the end of the day? Because most sales reps think that they have to get the information right then and there. Nobody needs the information right then and there, and that kills your momentum. So I go happy to send over. What information would you like to see? Because I got a lot of it here. When would you like to see? Hey. Is it okay if I get it to you by the end of the day? What are you gonna do with it? And then when they give you those answers, hopefully, if they don't, then you can kinda pull the, are you really serious? Do you really want this information? You're just trying to blow me off type of thing. But usually what I'll say is, great. When do you wanna schedule a call so we can follow-up on that information, see if it makes sense for us to take the next steps? They're probably gonna say, you know what? Next week's good. Then what you do is you do this. You go, when next week? And then you have to say and you do this with a really nice tone of voice. You you go, actually, you know what? You got your counter in front of you. And then shh. Wait for it. There'll be that real awkward pause where they realize that you got them. Because if they say no to that, they're blatantly lying to your face. Right? Hey, Arman. The day before our meeting, I'm gonna send you an email. Not are we still on for tomorrow, but, hey, I'm looking forward to our meeting tomorrow. In order to get the most out of our time together here, I put together a brief agenda. Could you do me a favor and email me back to let me know what else you'd like to add? And I put three bullet points on what I wanna talk about. Then the meeting starts. Hey, Aman. Thanks so much for your time today. Don't say dumb like, is this still a good time? That's a dumb thing to ask. Like, why would you give me that out? Actually, you know what? I gotta go to the bathroom right now. Why don't we push this till 03:30? Right? But what you should say is, do we still have thirty minutes? Do you have a hard stop at 02:00? Right? I do wanna know that. And then say, hey. I'm a you know what? I know you probably didn't see the agenda that I sent out yesterday. I just wanna make sure that we get the most out of our time together here. Here's a few things that I wanna make sure that we cover. What else do you wanna make sure that we add? And then whatever you say there, you build the agenda together, and then you start going through it. Can I dig into one point there? Because it's kind of related to expectation setting. So you're in the beginning of this meeting. You're saying, hey. Here are the things on the bullet points. What else would you like to add to the agenda? I wanna talk with you a little bit about artfully resetting or reshaping your prospect's expectations. So example of this. You get on that call. You say, what else would you like to talk about today? And I'm selling software, and they say, well, I really wanna make sure I understand your SOC two compliance and all the security credentials. I'm not equipped to talk about that, but they wanna talk about it today. So how do I artfully let them know that I'm not the guy to have that conversation? I think it has to do with the expectation you set in that original agenda email that you send over. Hey. This is what this meeting is for. It's really to identify what your needs are in these areas. You might even put in there, especially if that keeps happening to you. Right? If you keep getting yourself, then proactively address it. I just wanna make sure what this meeting is not going to be about. If these are the things you want to talk about, let me know so I can bring the appropriate resources into this conversation. Right? So I think it has to do with that because then you can lean on that even if they don't respond to it. You can then lean on that of, hey. Wait a minute here. I sent you agenda yesterday. This is what I told you what this meeting was about, and you didn't respond back to me. I'm sorry that I don't have that answer for you right now. But, basically, if you'd responded to me yesterday, you know what? I would have been able to bring these resources. So I think it has to do with how you set the stage. So, John, one of the things you're really well known for is this idea of the meeting efficiency survey. And Armand and I were going back and forth about that the other day because part of me feels like it can be buyer looks at that and like, oh, man. Another form that I gotta fill out. Didn't I fill one of those out with marketing? But then part of me is like, that can be a really good way to make sure the meeting is way more effective. One, can you kinda give a recap of what that looks like? And then two, what you're doing blocking and tackling wise to make it not an annoyance for your buyer? So now what I do is we take inbound leads. You fill out the basic form. What's your name? What what kind of training you're looking for, and what's your email address. Right? Then you get an automatic email from me that says, hey. Thank you so much for your interest in the Jay Barrow sales training. Here's a quick little agenda of usually how the calls go, and feel free to pick a time on my calendar, blah blah blah. And if you could spend the extra few minutes here filling out our meeting efficiency survey, I'd really appreciate it. You can either take five, and this is how I set the expectation. You can either take five minutes over lunch on your own time to fill this out, or we can spend probably the first ten to fifteen minutes of our call figuring this stuff out. Your choice. And all that stuff is for me now is what's your average sales cycle length? What's your ACV? How many SDRs? How many BDRs? What kind of training are you looking for? What technologies do you have in place? Like, all that stuff. And if they fill it out, I know I'm in for a good meeting. I know you've had Keenan on your show before, and we just had Keenan on too. Oftentimes, it's really hard for junior reps to hear, like, this over the top, stop going through the situational questions and immediately just go to the pain questions and the impact question right away. I usually prepare my questions based on the intel that they give me. You know what I mean? And also I have a checklist that I go through for every meeting that I go on. Right? And in that checklist is all the stuff did they fill out the meeting efficiency survey, but then it's, alright, I'm gonna go to their website. I'm gonna do look at their news and events. I'm gonna see what recent stuff happened within their business. I'm gonna go to that person's LinkedIn profile, see what's going on there. I'm then gonna try to find some based on my knowledge of them, I'm gonna find some similar examples of other customers that we've done work with that are in their space that might have a similar makeup there, and then I'm gonna frame my conversation around that. The best sales reps base their entire conversation around three to four problem oriented topics. Okay? And they ask 11 to 14 questions within those topics. And so what I do is I walk in, I'm just like, okay. Who's the persona I'm talking to? What industry are they in? Let me go do some homework now based on what I my perception is of their situation. What are the three to four problem oriented topics that I wanna build my conversation around? And then I actually come up with two or three questions, impact questions, associated with each one of those. And this is a nugget for everybody out there. At the end of every one of your call calls, if it turns into something that seems like there's some meat on that bone and that you've talked timeline and stuff like that, they're like, yeah. You know what, John? We need training and, we wanna roll it out in June, so we gotta make this decision by the end of the month. Okay. Great. Hey. Just out of curiosity, like, what happens if you don't do this in June? What happens if you don't do the training in June? That answer is gonna dictate your forecast. And the best reps that I've heard can take that impact question and say, not just leave it super open ended, but they can say, hey. If you don't do this by the thirtieth, right, how are you gonna close the series d that you talked about that's in seven weeks? And you can get super specific. I'll give you a perfect example. And and I think that you said reps are scared to dive right into it. They're also scared to ask the questions that are gonna potentially disqualify the account. And I'm telling them, no. No. No. No. Disqualify more than qualify. That's what you should do. Like, you need to look for all the reasons why they shouldn't do business with you. I had this layup that came in the other day. Client that I had done business with in the past, new VP of enablement, comes to me and says, oh, we need prospecting. I was like, great. You know, I've worked with you guys in the past. It was a couple years ago. I love you guys. You're fun. And I said, why? Why do you need prospecting? Oh, because pipeline, blah blah blah, new world, it's getting low and okay. Okay. And we're not hitting our numbers. And I said, okay. Well, how do you know it's a prospecting and a pipeline issue? She goes, what do you mean? I go, how do you know like, have you looked at the close ratios? Right? Like, the actual closed business. Like, what are those ratios? Right? Because you have a healthy close ratio and you got bad pipeline. Yeah. It's a pipeline problem. Right? But if you have a decent pipeline and bad close ratios, it might not be a pipeline issue. You might be and by the way, you might waste all this effort filling that pipeline with legit opportunities for people that can't close Right? So so do me a favor before we dive into this because I can talk prospecting all day long. Could you do me a favor and go back and find out what the conversion ratios are from a close rate standpoint? She came back and she was almost embarrassed to tell me. She goes, We have a problem. And I don't think it's a prospecting thing. And I'm like, Okay, talk to me. And she goes, Well, let's talk about reps who acquired Attainment, right? Like who hit their quota. She's like, We have 45 of our hit quota. I was like, alright. That's good. That's a pretty decent rate, give or take. 50% of your reps are hitting quota. Good job. And she's like, yeah. And I said, so what's the close ratio for them? And she said, it's about 28. And I was like, alright. Good close ratio. Those are healthy numbers. I go, what about the other 55%? I go, what's their close ratio? She said 5%. And I said, what? I said, 5%. I'm like, you have 55% of your employees who are only closing 5%. And you don't have a prospecting problem. You have a closing problem. You either have to fire 55% of your employees, like, today, or you gotta do something here short term to get that raised like, to give them some skills and tools to see if we can raise that 5% to 10% before we do anything on the front end of the funnel. I know we're coming up on time. So one thing I do wanna round out with, John, is you talked about selling to the 1020% of what people will actually use, and that's probably an even smaller percent of the problems you're going to solve for that specific prospect. So if we tie this to once we've understood their problems, we haven't gone through the slide deck and all that nonsense, and we have to decide what we're going to show them and how we're gonna do a demo. Any best practices around tying it all together after you've done a proper demo? Alright. So here's my tirade on demos. I can't stand demos because this is what happens. Most demos go like this. Right? They ask, so is this still a good time? Right? Again, don't ask that question. That's stupid. Say, do you still have thirty minutes? Do we have a hard stop? Right? But then they go, like, okay. We'll go through the thirty minute demo here that I'd like to go through with you. If you have any questions, let me know. Go through it. Just let me know. Okay? And then they press play and they go through every slide like they were badged for in boot camp and they pause intermittently and go, does that make sense? Does that make sense? Does that make sense? Nobody ever says no to that question, by the way. Nobody. So at the end of one of those canned pieces of your demos, they always give us that nice little parting gift. And if anybody's ever hears this word at the end of one of your demos, you know you've done a miserable job and it's the word digest. Right? I don't need a little time to digest what you just told me here. If you just if you hear that, stop and apologize to the person you just wasted their time. Right? It is our job to help them digest. Say it's an hour long demo, Benny. I don't give a how complex your solution is. Nobody wants to sit through an entire hour of you talking. So what you do is you take at least the first fifteen minutes at least and you set the stage like this. You go, I just wanted to solidify again what I know so far of your situation. Here's the highlights of what I know in your situation. Then what I just wanna go around real quick and get, like, what do you wanna get out of this, each one of you? So I'm a what do you wanna get out of this? Nick, what do you wanna get out of this? And then from there, I'll kinda dive into the presentation, and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna stop at certain points and just look for your feedback. Alright. So here's what I understand. Is this right? Great. Real quick. Out of all the stuff that we can talk about today, Ama, what do you wanna really make sure that you got out of this demo? Like, what's your main priority for this? Nick, what is your main priority for this? Fantastic. Right. Literally write those down as they say them. And then what you do is you start going through the presentation. And then you kinda skip through some of the stuff that's not really all that relevant and show them, like, you know what? That's we could go into days about that, but you said that wasn't really a priority. Now this part of our solution let me dive into this. Boom. Boom. Boom. Now, Nick, you had said earlier that one of your main priorities was this. This is the aspect of our solution that addresses that. Could you explain to me how that compares to what you're doing now? So instead of saying, does that make sense? You say, could you give me an example of how you see that fitting into your existing workflow? Because the way you explain to me how that fits into your existing workflow or how it compares to what you're doing now tells me everything I need to know on whether or not it made sense. This has been a tremendous time here, John, and we could keep riffing on the disco, the demo, and all that stuff. We have one last question. And if there was one thing that every rep on every sales floor needed to stop doing immediately to be more successful, what would one bad habit to break be? Still to this day, reps call to touch base to check-in with no reason, no purpose, have a reason every single time you reach out. You can use the cheat code of the reason for my call is, right, to fill in that blank because if you can't finish that sentence, you shouldn't be making the phone call. So So I think just stop and that leads to kind of a bigger one related which is just stop going through the motions. So many reps just go through the motions. They hit their 50 dials, they make they send their stupid emails, they blast out their dumb templates, they ask their stupid discovery questions, they give their stupid presentations and they don't give a. And so what I was trying to do is give reps the tools to be able to figure out how to elevate theirselves so they don't get replaced, right? COVID punches us all square in the mouth. Okay? Now all those reps and these aren't just sales reps, I mean every profession out there. If you were just going through the motions in your profession, not giving a not getting better, not treating it as a real profession, you know what I mean? And literally just going through the motions so that you can have a job. I almost guarantee you're out of a job right now. I almost guarantee. Because everybody knows when down economies hit and recessions hit, they don't start at the top, they don't start laying off from the top ladies and gentlemen, They start laying off at the bottom. And I know some of you are gonna be out there, oh, it was my fault. No. We were blah blah blah. I'm not saying it was. I'm just saying if you were that good, they wouldn't have fired you. I will say there are some extenuating circumstances. Don't get me wrong. Alright? But for the most part, I'm hearing a lot of people whining out there. Oh, they let me go. Oh, because of COVID. No. They didn't. I'm an executive. I'm a CEO of my own little company here. I can promise you that executives are using this time right now to fire those mediocre performers that they were dealing with in a growth economy and didn't want to fire because they didn't have any real good reason to other than mediocre performance. Now they're saying, oh, I'm sorry. Because of COVID, we can't afford to keep you on here. Use this as a wake up call. Use this as a wake up call to wake the up and realize that you can be better and you should be better and you should use this time to better yourself. Like listening to this podcast, like taking courses online, all those different things. If you are sitting back right now waiting for this thing so that you can go back and start looking for jobs again, you won't find a job when this thing is quote unquote over because a, it's not gonna be over. And b, there's gonna be a whole pool of candidates out there that you're gonna be fighting with. It's now a employer driven market. It used to be an employee driven market. Now it's an employer driven market. Alright, everybody. Stop going through the motions, and please check out John at jbaros.com. Absolutely. Yeah. And just to get a small heads up, we're launching a whole new brand new online platform on demand. It's on our website. It's gonna be like Netflix. So think of Netflix or Disney plus. Choose your trainer. Choose your topic. Super, super fun. Like, every piece of content I've ever put is gonna be in there and it's for $420 a year because I like the number. You get everything I got. So for $4.20, come and join us and be on the lookout for it because we're gonna be putting fire in there with me, Morgan, and James. Alright. Everybody join John for 04:20, and hang on for a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Your top four takeaways with John Barros include, number one, send a meeting efficiency survey prior to your calls to get qualification out of the way. Two, set up feeds for all of your top target accounts and prospects as the backbone for your discovery. That's how you learn about their business and ask good questions.
