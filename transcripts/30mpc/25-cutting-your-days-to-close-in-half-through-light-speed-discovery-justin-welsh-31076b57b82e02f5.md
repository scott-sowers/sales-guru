## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arlen Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski, and we're here today with the one and only Justin Welsh, the LinkedIn master, the head of his own consulting business, and previously the head of sales over at PatientPop. Nick, why should people listen? Well, today's episode is all about deal velocity. So if you wanna close your deals faster, you gotta listen to Justin. Three two one fester. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Justin. Welcome to the show. You know we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Sure. My first actionable takeaway is to use what I call, like, five level discovery to get deeper insights in during your sales process. And this really comes from being on the receiving end of a lot of discovery. Since I went out on my own fourteen months ago, I'm on a ton of sales calls, and discovery is a weak point for most salespeople, and they miss a lot of nuance that they can use inside of the sales call. So I'll give you a quick example. For for me, it's all about understanding technical pain. So when you hear someone say something that's a technical challenge, that is the cue to begin digging in. So that's l one, technical pain. L two is really the historical pain or gain where it's like, okay. Interesting. What have you done in the past to try and address that challenge? How did it work? Did it work? If it didn't, why not? You're starting to peel the onion back a little bit more. The next level is financial pain and gain. Right? So trying to understand if we could eliminate that challenge, what does that mean for your business in terms of revenue? Or if we could install something new because we recognize there's opportunity cost for not doing something, what might that mean revenue wise for you or your business? That's sort of the next l three. And then l four is really personal pain or gain. So it's really trying to understand how high of a priority it is for that very specific person that you're talking to. There might be multiple call points in an account. How urgent or how high of a priority is it to that specific person? And they'll generally give you one of three answers. Like, they wanna move right away. And if they wanna move right away, you wanna understand is there anything that might get in their way and change that priority. They might say it's a specific date in the future. And if so, you wanna dig in and understand why that date's important, or they might be completely nonspecific. And in that case, it gives you an opportunity to really understand, is it truly urgent, and is it truly a priority for them? So that's sort of one thing that I see people miss a lot. So that would be tip number one. Oh, man. We could have a whole show based on that. Let's get number two, Justin. Sure. Tip number two is really just using an upfront contract to shorten the sale. And this is probably the thing I spend the most time when I'm coaching reps is just their almost their unwillingness to use it. And for me, the speed or velocity of SMB SaaS, which I come from, is all about getting next steps. And you don't get next steps at the end of a sales call. You get next steps in the beginning of a sales call. That is the whole purpose. So, generally, I would say something like, hey. By the end of this call, I'd like you to be in a position where you're either interested and we plan a logical next step like a second meeting, or you're completely not interested. You tell me that candidly, and we avoid wasting each other's time. Is that fair? Most of the time, educated buyers, even uneducated buyers will say, yeah, I don't wanna waste your time, and I don't want you to waste mine. You've got an agreement for some sort of next step at the end of the call, and then you revisit the upfront contract at the end of the call. You hold them accountable to it. If it's a no, you let them go. If it's a yes, great. We agreed to a next step. Let's get that. Awesome. What's the last one, Justin? Round us out. Yeah. The last one is is one that I've recently, you know, really started getting more used to, especially through some of the guys on LinkedIn like Josh Braun, who talk about it a lot, which is using mirroring to really unpack true objections. And mirroring, I believe, is from that Chris Voss book, never split the difference. And it's really just sort of spitting back to them the last thing that you heard, raising the tone of your voice a little bit to formulate it as a question. So, you know, if someone would say, like, hey, Justin. I don't think that that pricing is gonna work for us. You just say, that pricing isn't gonna work for you? And then you just be quiet. Because most of the time, it's human nature to try and add additional context to what you meant. And what you're hoping to do is really uncover some additional information that you can use to overcome the objection or make sure that you actually have true clarity around what their real objection is. So it's five level, discovery to get deeper insights. It's upfront contract to shorten the sales cycle and it's mirroring to unpack true objections. Those would be my three tips. I'm a big fan of the upfront contract. I'm also a big fan of structured discovery. You need those things when you have a super fast deal cycle. So other than those two things, are there other things that you're doing in your deal cycles to maximize velocity? One of them is really generating what I call existential pain. What I mean by that is in SMB, it's an emotional buy. It's fast. Right? You're buying a lot of times on emotion, and people buy quickly when they feel this dreadful pain. And so I use this model to sort of suss that pain out in a really good way called the pastor model. And it's originally a copywriting model by a guy named Ray Edwards, and he used it to write long form copy. And I took a look at this model and thought, long form copy has a purpose. You're supposed to start reading it, and by the time you're done, you're supposed to have gone through a bunch of different emotions that make you wanna purchase something. That that's the whole point of long form copy. So I translated it into a sales methodology called called PASTR, and here's what it stands for. P is pain. So you uncover pain or you plant pain. Right? If they don't know they have pain, you you ask enough questions to where you you believe you can plant pain. That might sound like trickery, and it can be an SMB SAS. The next thing is a, which is amplification. This is the speed part. Right? You gotta amplify it. You gotta make it existential. You gotta really you gotta really make them feeling dreadful. Right? If they don't make a change, there should be a significant negative future, where they should be thinking about this negative future. Once you've done that, that's the huge tactic for really moving the deal quickly. And then it's on to s, which is telling a story. How do you actually solve that dreadful pain? T is transformation. Let me show you somebody else who was just like you that went through my story and came off the other end as transformed. O is offer. Here's the packages that we have. Make a recommendation. R is response. You ask for them to move forward. It's very simple, but it's a really good rigid structure for moving deals quickly. Justin, I'm curious about this plant and amplify thing that you're talking about because that's somewhere that I've really struggled as a sales rep before where I don't wanna be all doom and gloom. And sometimes I have trouble being like, oh, you just told me this challenge. Like, that's probably gonna mean your world's gonna be horrible in a week or a month. So how do you artfully plant and then amplify the pain that you know exists for your prospect? Let me give you an example of an actual client that I'm an adviser to. I'm an adviser to, a company called Bite Size, and they, do one second response to so when someone comes to your website, they fill out an inquiry, a form, you know, get a demo. And in one second, you get a text message to your phone. Instead of being like, hey. I gotta wait for the MDR, LDR, SDR to, like, get the email and then respond back. It's, like, very customizable. It's very quick. Right? And so, like, you can pitch that. You can say, like, hey, mister and missus VP of sales. What would it mean to respond to your leads faster? Right? Like, that's a fine pitch, and I think most talented VP's of sales recognize that it's important to get back to your leads. But, like, hey, how many leads do you guys get every month? Oh, 300? Cool. How many of those never end up on your calendar? About 50%. So a 150 leads that that come through your your lead form end up not on your calendar. Is that correct? Got it. You guys pay for those leads. Right? There there's cost per click for those? Cool. So those a 150 are generally what we would consider. Is it fair to say that those are wasted? Understood. Got it. And when you get leads and you get them on the calendar, how often do they close? Oh, they close at 25%. Great. So if we can get a 150 more leads at 25 percent, we're looking at roughly 30 new wins for your business. Is that right? Cool. We probably won't get all a 150 of those, but it sounds like there's a massive, opportunity for improvement here. But before we get into that, have you learned about how GDPR is affecting inbox rates? Have you learned about how email, carriers like Hey and Superhuman are making it even harder to get in your inbox? Before I tell you about Bite Size and how that works, can you tell me a little bit about how you're aiming your team or arming your team to deal with hay, to deal with superhuman, to deal with GDPR, to deal with the the the toughness of getting into people's inbox? Can you tell me a little bit about that? Like, mostly, they probably don't know about those things, and I'm slamming them with sort of this repetitive, like, fear based stuff. And people might think that's really shitty, and I can appreciate that. But it's true. Like, things are changing, and it's my job to let my prospect know how things are changing and to really tell them what could happen to their business if they don't make a change. And so that's that's to me is is is amplification. And so knowing that we're optimizing for speed when you're talking about SMB sales, at what point are you presenting price and trying to get them to acknowledge that there's value here and get them to make a decision? Is that on the first call, the second call, the tenth call? What are you doing there? For my teams, it's always been the first call. I come from a place where, you know, when I joined PatientPop as the VP of sales in 2015, they had one salesperson and their average sales cycle was twenty one days. By the time I left, it was eight and a half. So we had, you know, nearly cut that by 66% if my math is is correct. To me, I wanna ask on the first call. If I think that I've uncovered enough challenges, if I get agreement from the customer that they think that we can solve this challenge, which is where the upfront contract comes in, you say, hey. You know, at the beginning of the conversation, we agreed that there would either be you know, you would get this. You would think this product was valuable. You would think it solves your challenges or or it or it doesn't. How How are you feeling right now? Like, are we leaning towards solving your challenges here? Is this just not the right the right fit for you? If they say, hey. I definitely think there's a good fit here. You know, I'm leaning towards the fact there's a good fit here. I always get into pricing right away. I like to beat my customer to the pricing. I don't like to feel like I'm hiding pricing or they have to ask. And this this is applicable in SMB, and I don't know how applicable it is in enterprise. But I'll say, like, hey. Listen. I think it would probably make sense for us to go into two things. Why don't we walk through how much this costs? Because you're probably wondering. And then why don't we talk about what a really good implementation looks like. And pricing to me is an important conversation because I too often see reps say, we have these three packages. What do you think? It's like, what do you mean what do you what do I think? You're the expert. What should I be buying here? Right? As salespeople, it's our job to guide people to the right package even when it's not the most expensive one. So that's where the honesty, the integrity, the solution selling, the consultancy comes in. So I would always say, hey. We've got this package, this package, and this package. Would you mind if I made a recommendation? Customers always say, no. Go ahead. Now it's like, I would recommend this middle package. Right? And the reason that I would recommend it is because of x, y, and z. You do not need this most expensive one. You wanna buy it, I'll sell it to you, but trust me, you do not need it. And if you can't afford this middle package or it's not in budget, I think we can both agree that this bottom package will still suffice and meet your needs. Would you guys like to move forward? Here's what implementation looks like. So Justin, I'm a huge fan of this whole honesty, transparency, consultancy that you're talking about, and I wanna stick on pricing for a little bit, but I'm wondering if you go back to the discovery call, like the middle of that discovery call, when else are you discovery call, like, the middle of that discovery call, when else are you using, like, the disarmingly blunt transparency being very real and very honest? Is that a a tool you use frequently? I do, but I ask permission to be candid. And I found that if you're talking to me about your business, Nick, and and I just said something really blunt, right, it can be it can be alarming. It can be sharp, like a sharp tool. Right? But if I ask you permission to be blunt, your general response is you like, if I said, hey, Nick, you know, I'm taking a look at your business, and I see an issue. Could could I just be really candid with you about what it is? You're like, yeah. Totally. It's more it's more it's better than me saying, like, you've got this really big issue and it's x. And you're like, woah. Hold on. Hold on, sales guy. I just met, you know, fifteen minutes ago. So oftentimes, I just simply ask for permission to be candid, and I'll say, like, hey, you know, doctor Smith, you know, I've been taking a look at your website, and would you mind if I just shared something really candidly and openly? I wanna make sure that we're we're comfortable with that. They'll generally say, sure. And I'll say, listen. It looks like what you bought, they they kinda fleeced you here. Like, if you open up the hood here on this website, I can put it through this tool, and it's clearly not built well. And I just wanted to point that out to you, but I wanted to do it in a way where where you felt comfortable. Do you feel like, you you know, after me showing you this, do you do you agree with that? Most of the time, they'd be like, yeah. Yeah. I really got taken advantage of. It's like, let me show you an easy way to move forward with our company so that you don't get taken advantage of. Right? Let me let me walk you through how we're gonna do that for you. And so for me, it's just permission to be candid. So, Justin, I think this discovery thing is gonna weave in again and again in everything that we talk about here. But one of the things that I'm really curious about I mean, you literally cut the deal cycle, the deal length into a third of what it was when you started at PatientPop. And I think discovery was a big part of that, but I bet there were other things in addition to that that you were coaching the team and putting into play. And so I'm wondering if anything else comes to mind. We had sort of a mantra at PatientPop where, you know, we each each AE had a lot of opportunities. And so I didn't always want them to be holding on to opportunities that spans an incredible amount of time. And other sales leaders will be like, hey. You gotta work this deal until it gets done. And I can appreciate that. Right? But when we ran the data, we saw correlation between sales cycle length and churn. Right? Those customers that are so hard to win, that are so against spending the same amount of money that all of our other customers are spending very quickly are generally those that churn. So oftentimes, what I would do is ask folks, you know, if the deal went longer than ten days or twelve days to push it on out of their pipeline and to focus on the ones that are clear and crisp and wanna make a decision because that kept my reps really focused on the customers that were best for our business versus spending a lot of their time actually chasing these longer cycle deals that ultimately either churn prelaunch or churn within this first six months, and they got their commission clawed back. And I had unhappy salespeople, and I had an unhappy boss because churn went up. So that was, like, something that that comes to mind. I think maybe one other thing that comes to mind is just being really, really well educated on our competitive space. And I know that sounds, like, very cliche, like, we should all be educated on our competitors. But truly knowing as much about your competitors as you know about your own product allows you to be an expert. In an SMB SaaS, especially with an uneducated buyer making an emotional decision, expertise is often the thing that pushes the deal over the edge. If you get on a call and you're making an emotional buy and it's not that expensive and the guy or gal that you're talking to is clearly an expert, knows everything about the industry, everything about your business, everything about their product, everything about every other product that you've ever looked at, like, you make that decision often and quickly when you have trust and confidence. And my guess is when you're at PatientPop, you're not always up against competitor. And so sometimes you you don't wanna bring it up. Right? You don't want to to warrant somebody to start looking. And so do you have a perspective or a philosophy on how you suss out competition, and then if you proactively mention it at all? So I would often just ask, like, hey. Sounds like marketing your practice is top of mind for you right now. I can't imagine that we're the only people that you're talking to. Who else are you guys looking at? I'd love to to learn more. Like, again, like, most of the time, if you've established expertise, they will share that with you. You have to earn that. Right? I think if you're a really bad salesperson and you're going through a really poor demo and you're like, tell me who else you guys are looking at. They're like, no. That's alright. But if I just gave a 45 minute and this will sound arrogant. It's not intended to at all, but I'll use a word. Like, if you just give a forty five minute master class in, like, online marketing to a physician, you're like, hey, by the way, like, that's everything I know about this space. Like, you're probably looking at some other folks. Who are you looking at? Love to love to help you make a decision even if it's not us. Like, you have to earn that. And so I would like to ask those things. And if they gave me the competition, I would give a candid, honest breakdown. Here's where that platform is really strong. Here's where I think they're really weak. Here's how I think it compares to our platform. If your goal is x, I would recommend us. If your goal is y, I would recommend them. I think they do a better job at that. Like, being honest to me always always gave me a leg up in in the deal. Justin, I'm I'm curious because this is something that my very first boss and my first sales job really hammered. Like, we literally did competitive intel sessions every single week, and I had no idea how to actually understand my competitors. Like, I thought I could go poke around their website, but I'm curious for the new reps listening to this show that wanna get a good grasp on their competitors, but not spend fifteen hours reading their 10 k's and browsing every single page on the site map. What are the things that they should be looking for so that they can have more educated conversations with buyers about the competition? Yeah. I think it's such a funny question, just to be honest. Right? Like, here's why I think it's funny. I've heard reps be like, my company doesn't have x and I wanna learn it. How do I do it? It's like, don't you go to YouTube every day and YouTube stuff? Like, when things are personal or interesting to you, you wanna learn how to build a shelf, you wanna learn how to change the oil on your car, you wanna learn how to cook a a recipe. Everyone is so good at going to YouTube and Google and all these, you know, resources we have at our our fingertips. But the minute something's not immediately in front of their face on a company LMS, they're like, hey. I can't find the answer. It's like, the the answer is easy. Treat your job like you would treat something interesting that you're going to do in your spare time. And that's the true answer. Like, proactive learners, proactive educators will always be ahead of those who don't. The other thing that we tend to run into with small deal cycles is you might be talking to the DM, and you know this person's the DM, but they're not ready to make a decision on that call or at least that's what they're motioning to you. And what it sounds like is, like, I gotta review this with my team internally. I have to noodle over this. Could you send me a PDF of all the things that you shared with me? And oftentimes, those people are gonna buy, but they're gonna buy in two or three weeks, or they're just lying to you and they're gonna give you a no. And so how do you figure out the truth quicker and then make people to make a decision now versus in three weeks? Yeah. There's there's a couple of different tactics. Right? Like, I I would usually throw it back and say, like, cool. I can appreciate that. I have a wife. We make decisions as a family, and sounds like you have a team and you make decisions as a team. Can I ask you something? Do you mind if I just ask you a quick question? Yeah. Sure. Hey. If you didn't have a team and you were buying this, would you buy it? And, like, I just wanna know what they're gonna say. If they say, yeah, I'd buy it. I would just say, oh, cool. I mean, you're the decision maker. Right? We we established that in the beginning of the call. If you love it and you wanna buy it, why don't we get started today? Right? We can start solving x problem that you talked about. We can start solving y challenge that you were talking about. We can start getting the z revenue that we discussed. Like, that that would be one way, or I use a rule of two or ask that question, and then they give me the answer and I just say, yeah. You know, the reason that I asked is usually when someone tells me they wanna talk it over with their team, it means one of two things. Either they're not truly interested or blah blah blah, whatever else. And they either have to agree with one of those things. Yes. It's because I'm actually not that interested. Great. Out of my pipeline. Or they say, no. It's actually because of that other thing that you mentioned. Cool. At least you understand that. Right? Or they say something different. Well, actually, no. It's because a. And now you have the real objection. Right? And so you can start working on that objection, peeling the onion back, trying to get through it. Justin, one thing you just mentioned was this thing called a a rule of two, and I'm assuming it's somewhat related to a play that you're using. What is a rule of two? Yeah. Rule of two is when you get an objection, you say, typically, when I hear something like that, it means one of two things, a or b. And it kind of forces them into a box. It's either a or b. The most common thing is it's neither of those things. And they say, well, it's not a and it's not b. It's actually c. And what you've done is flushed out the true objection. Instead of saying, oh, what do you mean by that? That's almost a lazier question because you're just like, oh, take me right to the answer. You're, like, at least making it look like you're making an effort, and those could plausibly be their response. But in reality, again, what you were talking about when you you shut up, with the mirroring piece, you're actually giving them an opportunity, human nature, to provide more clarification and context around what they just said. Sure. Rule of two is that is it can be used as a replacement for mirroring. There's so many different objection techniques that you can use. I I've always liked rule of two. I'll kinda give you an example. Someone says, like, oh, this is too expensive. And you say, hey. I get it. Usually, when I hear it's too expensive, it's that they're they're actually not ready to make a commitment, or they've been burned in the past, and so they're sort of hesitant to pull the trigger. They might be like, actually, it's neither of those things. We're doing a Salesforce installation, and right now, that's top priority for us. It's like, oh, okay. Cool. Cool. It's really good that I just figured that out because now I can push this deal, you know, its close date a month down and not irritate my manager by saying it's gonna come in on Monday. And so that's just sort of like an example of rule two, but it's another tool in your toolkit. So, Justin, I I think you've talked about a number of different plays. And, you know, Nick and I have sold a lot of a lot of different companies, and so we can figure out how to nestle each of these things in. But oftentimes, we have new reps on the calls where they don't know how to run a discovery call beginning ten, and so they try to jam in an upfront contract. Maybe they try to use the rule of two somewhere, and it it all just ends up becoming a really inorganic conversation. And so how do you think about documenting your plays as a new rep and figuring out, like, what questions I should be asking where? Are you using scripts? Are you using general buckets? Like, how do we actually learn how to do proper discovery? Yeah. We start with scripts. Right? I'm I'm actually a fan of scripts, and people are like, oh, it takes away the creativity. It's like, cool. Get as creative as hell once you're awesome at this. Right? Like, more power to you. But in the beginning, like, everyone needs to understand the process. And so for me, like, I always built a deck that you could literally read and hopefully make a sale. Right? It even had, like it's green means this is a customer question. Blue means, you know, this is something that you should dive deeper into. Red means you're showing your screen. You're pointing at this thing. Like, we we we got really granular. And when people started to understand those things, we turned it into an if this, then that chart. Right? So it's like, here's how the call starts. We go down this path. Well, if this happens, we're gonna go down here. If this happens, we're gonna go down here. And we basically built out the framework for navigating a challenging demonstration. And so it starts with scripting, and then we would move it into a framework. Alright, Justin. We've hit it all. We hit everything in discovery, the agenda, the disco, driving next steps, competitors, but we haven't talked about some of the bad habits that we gotta break. And so if there was one bad habit that every rep needed to break today to be better, what would that be? Stop showing every feature of your product during the demonstration. Only show things that you learned about in discovery. Anything you wanna plug with the audience before we jump off? I would say, you know, people can visit me at the official justin.com. And I also have a a small course about how to grow your audience on LinkedIn, and that is at the linkedinplaybook.com. Alrighty, guys. And Justin's being a little bit too humble here. Please go follow him on LinkedIn. He has a huge following. A lot of what Nick and I do is really based on some of the things that he talks about. And hang on for a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Your top four takeaways from the episode with Justin Wolff include, number one, plant pain early on. If your customer does not understand what you do, make sure you plant some early examples using extreme industry expertise. Number two, use an upfront contract to propose next steps at the beginning of the call, not at the end. Number three, use the rule of two when you hit a tough objection, which sounds something like, hey. Typically, when people tell me x, it usually means one of two things. And then number four, ask for permission before the hard questions. If somebody is saying, Yeah, I gotta go talk to my team, ask them, Hey, do you mind if I ask you a really hard question? And then ask, Honestly, if you didn't have a team, would you buy? Nick, those are our takeaways. How can people help us out?
