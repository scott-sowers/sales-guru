## Transcript

These are the eight and hardest sales leadership lessons we've learned, whether it was making a bad hire, making a horrible coaching mistake that made someone leave, or having a leader that we had that made us realize that we never wanna lead teams that way. Let's get into number one. So number one is if it's not a fuck yes, it's a a fuck no when you're hiring salespeople. A lot of times when you're hiring people there are four performance ratings. A one is the worst and a four is the best. And the most dangerous hires in the world are when everyone's rating them as like a three, which is like a soft yes. They're not good enough where I'm gonna, like, pound the table and be like, we should have this person on the team, but there's no, like, glaring weakness where it's like this person's totally awkward or they bomb the cold call. They're just okay. And the problem is when you're under the pressure to hire. I see it all the time when orgs are like, you gotta double your team. You gotta hit triple the number. They're like, I think this person will get the job done. Three things end up happening when you say yes to threes. Number one, everyone just sort of starts to become average on your team. You'll notice you hire one person who's a three, another person who's a three, another person's a three. And what ends up happening is, like, the overall standard that made your team special in the early days when you had to hire killers for every single role, you'll slowly see it creep downward versus when you're hiring four after four after four after four, every time that new person jumps onto the Sales Floor, you'll see everyone on the Sales Floor sit up a little bit because they're like, oh, shit. That new kid on the block is really, really good. I've gotta keep my game sharp. Versus when you continue to hire average people, everyone's like, I think I can beat that guy. Like, I don't have to go as hard as I used to go in my first six months. That's number one. Number two is they become the tell you what to do hires, where if you tell them what to do, they will go and do it. But the best hires in the world are the ones that come to you and they're like, hey. This is what I think I should do or here's something I've learned about the job that you didn't think about before. Here's a new way I'm running the sales process that's actually gonna show you that the whole way that you're running at the last six months was wrong. The best hires tell you what to do. You don't have to tell them what to do. And then lastly, number three, when they get to the twelve or eighteen month mark, the problem is they get stuck in the org and they start to cause cultural problems because they're not good enough that you can promote them, but they're usually good enough to get to like 70 to 80% of the job. So what ends up happening is you have this like lingering cling to the middle strategy where you have this like revolving door of people at the bottom who are leaving your org. You have this revolving door of people who are getting promoted above them and then you have this big chunk of people who are just stuck in the middle who aren't good enough to go get another job, but they're pissed off that they're not being promoted and then you end up having cultural rot within your org. So to be clear, this does not mean that you need to hire for perfect fours across the board. I have never hired for threes across the board and had that person be outstanding. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. But I have hired for fours and twos in the performance ratings and had that person blow it out of the water. I learned this when I was at Carta. You should never hire for lack of weakness. You should hire for strengths. So if you have two or three people on your team who are like, this person is a four out of four, they are pounding the table because I think this person has a superpower in their ability to cold call or a superpower in their ability to run a discovery call. And then you have a couple people who are twos because they're like, yeah, but I don't think their process is that good or I don't think they're a good forecaster. That's okay because usually the people who make it to president's club, they're making it to president's club because they're outstanding at a couple of things in their skill set and then they get good enough at their blind spots versus being okay at everything else. Number two is proof of performance over everything. No hypothetical questions allowed when you're interviewing a rep. I'm doing a ton of hiring right now, and I used to ask reps questions like, alright, talk to me about how you think about prospecting, or hey, when you get on a discovery call, how do you think about running that call? And the problem is, every rep knows what to do. And I would hear things like, oh yeah, I do deep research, I read their 10 ks, when I get on the call I set a really clear agenda, and I ask questions that get to pain, and I act like a consultant. Those are the right answers. The problem is in sales, everybody knows what to do. The hard part is the how, the actual execution of that stuff. And so I had probably 20 interviews where I kept getting off of them and I'm like, everybody has the right answers but something about this doesn't smell right. And then we did a couple podcast interviews with Kevin Dorsey and Jake Dunlap and they were like dude, no questions, you have to get proof of performance. And so instead, now instead of asking what's your approach to discovery, I get on and I'm like cool, let's roleplay a discovery call. Pretend we already made the small talk, you're gonna set the agenda, and we'll just roleplay from there. And you would be amazed how many people have the right answers but can't set a clear agenda, they can't ask actual questions, they start totally flubbing and fumbling over their words, and I don't expect perfection in an interview where I'm asking you to mock roleplay a discovery call, but if you can't have conversation, I know that you are not my hire. So number three is if I'm turning around a sales team, I follow the two two two rule. So you gotta flip two, hire two, and fire two people. You cannot be walking on eggshells when you are doing a turnaround of a sales team. This happens a lot when you're hiring SDRs too where they can conceptually say a cold email should have personalization, a problem, a solution, and an interest based ETA. Yep. And then you actually have them write the email, and you're like, oh my god. It's like a 17 page email. There are misspellings. The way they articulated the problem is like awkward in seller pitchy voice. And that's because theoretically, people can usually know the steps, but executing the steps well in practice is a completely different step. And you need to get that proof and get hands on keys or get real talk tracks in practice. So when I first took over the sale development team at Carta, there were, like, 15 or so reps. And all of the top reps had literally gotten promoted and then they were, like, great. Go fix the shit that's left over. And I was, like, great. Thanks. So I looked at the dashboard and the average rep was making between fifty and seventy five cold cold calls per week, which for a sales development team and SDR team is absolutely ridiculous. Even without a parallel dialer, you should be at 200 dials a week. And no one on the team believed that cold calling was a good use of time. And so I see a lot of leaders getting this position where they see an org and they're like nudging. They're like, hey, guys. Maybe we should pick up the phone. Hey, guys. I see that other people are doing a 150 dials. Oh, shoot. This person did 75. Great. Good job. You did 80 this week. And they're, like, trying to nudge their way through a turnaround. And what ends up happening is they, like, nudge for one week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, and then no results happen. And what ends up happening is a hard culture change needs to come in. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. And one of two things happens. Either that manager is forced to go and fire a bunch of people on the team or that manager is just taken out on day one. So when I came in, the first thing I had to do is I had to find two or three people on the team who I felt were willing to change. And so those are my first two or three. And I got them in a room and I was like, hey. We've got a problem on this team. I think you two or three reps can, like, help me turn this thing around. Can I count on you guys to step up? And, like, I want it to be a foregone conclusion that every single week, you're gonna hit 200 dials, and I need you to set the standard for the team. And so every single week, I would give those folks a little bit more attention. I would let them know that I'm watching, and they would put 200 or 300 dials up. And then the next week, it was three or four people. And the next week, it was four or five. And the next week, it was five or six because I'd flipped the original two or three. And then eventually when six people on the team are doing that thing, the remaining three, it was sort of weird for them to not be doing it. And I knew very quickly that those were the people who were not gonna get on board and those are the people that I was gonna let go and that's when you can start to flush new blood into the team. So I always tell people when they're turning around a team who are the two people you're gonna flip, who are the two culture setters that you're gonna hire, and then who are the two people that you're gonna let go to make sure that you flush out the old cultural problems. Number four is if you have a rep that is not performing, you should let them fire themselves. What the lesson behind this one is you need to set extremely explicit standards for your team and hold them to those standards from day one. If somebody doesn't hit the dial goal that they have, if they're not following up with customers in the way that the expectation is set for your team, you need to call that out the very first time. Because if you tolerate it for one week, two weeks, three weeks, and then call it out at the end of the month, they're like, woah what changed? If someone isn't performing, if someone is not hitting your standards, it should never be a surprise to them. One thing that I think surprises a lot of sales leaders is reps want to know how how to win. They want to know how to get things right. And they actually appreciate when you say, hey, you're not meeting the mark over here. Here is what I expect out of you. And when you're really really clear with that, good performers are like, great, now I know the answers to the test. I know how to win. And bad reps will actually opt out and they'll say, hey, you know what? Like, I'm not gonna do that or I can't do that or I'm not willing to do that. And they'll leave the job of their own volition and you don't have to go through the whole HR thing. And so I'm not recommending you be callous or cruel or disrespectful to your team. I am recommending that you set a standard and you hold people to that standard from the very first day. So number five, more reps does not equal more revenue. There have been two times in my career where I've had to let go of reps, and when I let go of those reps, revenue actually went up. And I know this isn't something that people wanna talk about, but it usually happens when sales leaders are forced over hire. So a lot of times what'll happen is if I need to generate $10,000,000 of revenue and I'm currently generating five, they're gonna be like, great. I should go hire five more reps with a $1,000,000 quota, and you just add 5,000,000 more, and now I'm at the $10,000,000 number. And that sounds right in theory if you believe that every rep can come in and reasonably close a million dollars more. But the problem is a lot of times the issue isn't how many reps you have to close deals. A lot of times the issue is the number of leads there are to go around to the team. So what ends up happening is when you bring a team from 10 reps to 20 reps or from 20 to 40 or from 50 to a 100, you can double the size of your team a lot faster than you can double the size of your lead pool. So what ends up happening is you have like this big pizza that's like leads that all of your top reps are eating out of. Right? Your top rep gets a slice of pizza and they close a deal at a 33% win rate. And that's great. And what ends up happening is you basically take the same pizza pie of leads and when you double your team size, you just end up slicing the same pizza into smaller slices. And what ends up happening is everyone just gets a smaller piece of the pie. And so it's not like you're actually increasing revenue because you haven't actually increased the number of leads that you're that are coming into your sales team. And then what happens is revenue can actually go down because if you only have a 100 leads to give out and you're sending 10 of those leads away from a top performer into the hands of a middle performer or a new rep, your win rate is what matters on those leads and your win rate will actually go down because a new rep is managing those. So on two different occasions, in two different economic downturns, our revenue numbers were taking a hit like every other tech company was. And I had to let go of a bunch of reps because we started to have performance issues. And I was really worried about that because I was like, we have to add up these quotas and every rep contributes a 100 k per month or whatever it is. I was like, I don't know how I'm gonna hit my number without this. And eventually, I was forced to make the decision. I made the decision, and what ended up happening is the next month, we actually had a record month because we had the same number of leads and we were just passing the ball to Jordan each time instead of passing the ball to a bench player who could win one in five deals. We took the same pool of leads that we had and we made sure that every single time we got a hot lead, it was being sent to a top player who could close it every single time. So if you're trying to hit a revenue number a lot of times you should be asking yourself not how can I hire more reps but rather how can I get more leads? And if your team is having performance issues a lot of times you need to ask yourself would I be better off downsizing my team and making sure that every single lead is being closed every time and making sure that I'm keeping my top performers fed instead of trying to hold on to the mediocre middle performers so number six is tell your team to stop responding to your Slack messages so quickly. I see so many salespeople struggle to hit their goals because they'll make six cold calls and then they check their Slack messages and then they send 10 sales emails and then they check their inbox and refresh it to see, oh, did anybody respond yet? And that is a horrible way to live as a salesperson because you are constantly pulling your attention and ping ponging all over the place. The right way to do it is put your head down, make 40 cold calls an hour, and then pick your head up and respond to messages that came in. And as a sales leader, you want your team having that level of deep focus blinders on mode. And the first way to do that is you have to get out of their way. And so anytime I onboard a new rep, I tell them, hey. I'm gonna Slack you at all times throughout the day because I'm gonna need deal updates, or I'm gonna say, hey. We're doing something different with our forecast, or, hey. We're running a promo later this week. Wanted to give you a heads up. I do not expect and I do not want you to respond to that message unless it is in one of your three Slack or email response blocks on your calendar. I want you to respond to the email in Slack three times a day. No more. In the morning, at noon before you take lunch, and at the end of the day. All your other time should be in focus time or in front of customers. And the reason that I do this is when you bring a new rep onto your team, they don't know what your communication expectations are. And they don't want to look bad in front of their new boss by not responding to messages in a timely manner if their last boss expected that. And so I'm really clear. I'm like, I don't want fast responses because I want you to be able to focus. So set that expectation with your team and you will see everybody's activity and pipeline built go up. When I was the VP of sales at Pave, I used to do this funny test on the Sales floor. I would at 09:45AM, I would send a Slack to my rep, and it would just say, are you prospecting? In all lowercase. And I would look at them, and I would see if they would look back at me. And if they did, I knew they weren't because their Slack was open. And so I trained my team from nine to twelve. Your Slack needs to be closed. Those are your golden hours when you should be cold calling, cold emailing, and getting after it and building pipeline. And eventually, tongue in cheek, they got a good laugh out of it, and they got used to closing their slack. That's so number seven is the twenty eighty rule. If you ever wanna train your team on something, you should spend 20% of your time training and teaching your team and 80% of your time reinforcing the concept. If you run a big training and then you never talk about it again, nine times out of 10, you should've just let your team keep selling because they're not gonna remember a thing. I was at Carta and we spent over a $100,000 bringing in Sandler, which is a big training organization, full two day sales kickoff training where they teach us everything from, like, how to run a discovery call, how to prospect, how to run a sales process Sandler way. And what ended up happening is in between sales kickoff hangovers for eight hours a day for two days in a row, We're literally just sitting there and being drilled with discovery question frameworks, agenda frameworks, all this stuff. And at the beginning, it kinda worked. The first week after the training, our CRO was really stoked. He was hearing people use the upfront contract. He's like, there it is. He had a channel called Sandler wins. People are like, great. I used the negative reverse in this channel. And then the second week, it went from, like, 75% of the reps doing the thing to, like, 50%. And then the third week, it was 25%. And at the end of the first month, he came to the sales leadership team and he was all pissed. He's like, what happened, guys? I don't hear anyone using the Sandler stuff anymore. And I was like, dude, other than the initial upfront training, we're doing our pipeline reviews the same way. We're doing our deal reviews the same way. We don't run a single discovery tape review to reinforce anything we've talked about from Sandler. If I went on that sales floor right now and I asked 10 people what is the definition of a negative reverse, which is a Sandler sales technique, I guarantee I would get 10 different definitions because you ran a sixteen hour training when people were hungover and you never talked about it again. And so what should be done is whenever you wanna drive a change in your sales team, you need to think, what's the one thing that I wanna teach my team this month? In week one, you're gonna run a one hour training teaching them how to run a discovery call or how to ask discovery questions a certain way. And then for the next weeks two, three, and four, you're gonna run discovery tape reviews reinforcing those discovery questions and calling back and jamming it into their heads over and over and over again until your reps can literally complete your sentences. If you're trying to teach a cold call framework, spend one hour teaching the cold call framework and then do three weeks of cold call reviews where you are jamming into their heads over and over and over again. If your reps cannot literally complete your sentences by the end of the four weeks, you have not reinforced your training enough and you cannot move on to the next topic. Number eight is every rep fucks up, but if it's the first time that it happens do not rub salt in the wound. This was a huge lesson that I learned from my VP of sales when I totally bombed a deal that we should have won. So I used to sell legal technology to big big law firms, and we had an on-site demo with this huge law firm in Austin Texas. And I flew in from California, my VP of sales was like hey this is a really big deal, she flew in from Kansas City. And I had told the law firm, hey the demo is gonna start at 1PM. And I put on my calendar and my VP's calendar, we're gonna arrive at 1PM. We show up, we had landed in Austin at like ten so we just posted up at a cafe and worked, and we show up at the law firm's office at one. And There is a room full of attorneys in the conference room being like, I thought the demo was gonna start at one. And the problem was, I didn't account. We needed like a good half hour for all of the tech set up to get our solutions consultant to dial into the Zoom. And we ended up starting the demo like forty minutes late because I didn't account for setup time for the demo. I told my VP our arrival time was one, and I told the law firm the start time was one. You have to show up early. And because we started so late, it totally threw the demo off. We ended up, like, losing the deal because of it. And I'll never forget walking out of the building and, like, my face is super red. I felt so ashamed. Like, it was a really conscientious rep, and I'm like am I gonna get fired, what's gonna happen, and I'll never forget. She looks at me and she's like it's all good, like you've never been late to a meeting before, like I know this is one of your first on sites, this stuff happens, what I do in the future is just like also block transit time and setup time on your calendar so you know you have that buffer. And I was like woah I thought you were gonna like start yelling at me or you were gonna be a jerk, and what it did for me as a rep was I knew that this person trusted me and she was gonna show me grace when I made mistakes, and for the trusted me and she was gonna show me grace when I made mistakes. And for the rest of my time working for her, I would do anything for her. If she needed me to stay late, if she needed me to put in extra prep, if she needed me to cover for a rep that was on PTO, I would do anything for her because she showed me that she trusted me and that it just it it really really like touched me as a salesperson that yeah I'm gonna screw up but this is somebody that showed me grace. And so that's something that I picked up as a leader is like hey if someone screws up the first time, you don't rub salt in the wound. If it happens again, you need to set that standard and hold them to it, and that's a different story. But even your best reps are gonna make mistakes. This is an extremely pivotal moment the way that you handle it as a leader. So folks, those are your eight lessons. And if you like these, I've got two resources for you. A lot of what we talked about in this episode is how to hire and then train and coach your reps. And so if you like this one, there's a link right here to our four step account executive interview process to hire top 1% sales reps. And then number two, there's a link over here to my ultimate four week sales onboarding program that I use to take those elite reps and bring them to presidents club caliber on my sales team. So go check those out either up here or down in the show notes and we'll see you on the next one.
