## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Armond Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have a very unconventional guest. His name is Alec Bruski. He's the number one account executive over at Tower Point. And get this, his job is not to sell, but to buy people's properties that have cell towers on them. Crazy sales tactics in this episode. Why should people listen? Armand, we've spent a lot of time on this show talking about objection handling techniques, and Alex is the first person who is intentionally asking for objections. You gotta listen to him. Three, two, one, pick up the phone. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals.

Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to dock.

And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, Alex. Welcome to the show. You know we start every episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. Number one, buy with one click. What this means is when you're talking to a prospect who's ready to do the deal, there's no need in extending the process any longer. Help that person get back to their day, get their time back, close the deal. And for someone working an enterprise deal, large complex sale may not mean the same thing. What you may be looking at is asking that question right away that you would normally say for a discovery call. Don't elongate the process for your prospects. Number two, encourage disqualification. And I use encourage here purposely because of two particular reasons. It's gonna psychologically draw you to that person based on their vulnerability or you're gonna actually finally get the real objection that's holding them back. And last, number three, answer the question in as little words as possible. Self explanatory. So, Alex, my question there, because something I've been taught as a salesperson, is to never skip steps. If someone wants to get right to the demo, I gotta do a little bit of discovery first. Right? So how do you balance moving a prospect efficiently through the sales cycle while also doing your job to make sure you actually close the deal? What's key here is gonna be your question asking because there are gonna be people that are gonna fall into two buckets. There are people that are gonna want you to play your hand as quickly as possible. Right? And they're trying to get you to do that purposely. And there are the people that genuinely have maybe done research on your company, are aware of what you offer, are already interested in your offering. And so what that may look like is, hey. Yeah. I don't wanna show you anything that you don't wanna see or or waste your time. I mean, what what was it that you were hoping to move forward with? So when else are you doing that in the process? Like, you're negotiating. You're you're showing a demo. When else are you cutting out the fluff and the stuff the customer doesn't need or the prospect doesn't need to accelerate the deal? The shorter the process you can start from the initial outreach, the more quickly you're going to build trust. If you're holding things back from your prospects purposely to keep them engaged, keep them interested, they're they're gonna feel that. We live in a very transparent society. Everything's out there on Google. Everything's out there on g two, on on Yelp. What this Maven look like, let's just say for someone who's even working more of an enterprise deal, if you've got your big question at the end of your discovery process that really lets you kinda know right away, hey. If this person is not receptive to this idea, they're gonna reject this question. And don't be afraid to ask that right away. There's no need in being worried to spoil the deal when in reality, the person on the other side of the phone is milking every single second out of their day that they can to be efficient. So okay. Let's go back to this building trust thing because you do this really effectively. And I think it has something to do with your somewhat unconventional stance around disqualification and pushing the customer respectfully away. Can you talk about what that looks like and why that ends up building trust and a better relationship? People are gonna do what they're incentivized to do. No matter what industry, no matter what person. So we need to be cognizant of that when we're on the phone with people and know how is this person incentivized. Because no matter what, that's likely the way that person's going to lean regardless. And so when you're making the perspective of your conversations, this is what you can do for your company. This is how much money you want for your cell tower. If you wanna do this $10.31 exchange, where would you be looking to put the funds? Not this is what we do. These are the specialties that we provide. These are the sorts of customers that we work very well with. You're you're losing the person on the other end of the phone. All they're thinking is what's in it for me. And one of the things that I I've heard in your value prop, I wanna dig into it, is, you're so, like, cut and dry. This is what the hell we do and, like, why we solve it. At Carta, I hear it all the time where people will be like, we, automate and centralize as one source of truth, everything related to your equity. And it's like, guys, stop. You need valuation after you raise round. It is free. That's it. Super simple. So can you walk us through, like, your cut and dry simple value prop when you're on the phones? One thing every single salesperson needs to know how to do is describe what they and their company do in one sentence and encompass everything that you do. Because this goes back to the transparency age that we're in. Any information is already accessible out there. No matter what industry you're in, you're basically always gonna have competitors. And so are you gonna hide behind that and pretend that it doesn't exist, or are you gonna confront that elephant in the black room right away? And, Arman, I've even heard you say this. These people are gonna have a negative thought in their head either way. Why don't we narrate that for them as opposed to letting them come to their own conclusion? So the best litmus test if you're a new salesperson, you're at a new company is, like, try to explain to your grandmother what your company does. And if she doesn't get it, you probably need to dumb things down a little bit because your customers are getting bombarded with vendors calling, emailing, texting, LinkedIn message saying that they're optimizing and centralizing and maximizing and forward thinking cutting edge tech. And they're like, I don't know what this actually means. It kills me. We've got a little bit of, hype fatigue. Right? Everyone's got the newest and the latest and the best. And what you actually find is when you're willing to talk about where you're vulnerable and you find that you can tell people upfront, hey. These are maybe some of our shortcomings, then those people are gonna be so much more drawn to you because it's out there. The information is gonna get found out regardless. And this also goes on the tangent I was gonna start earlier is that when I was first starting in sales, I would try to get through my sales process tiptoeing, right, on the marble floor to not rise any skepticism. Right? Or, like, do my best to, like, not draw out an objection. And what I found is that at the end of the sales process, that was a lot of ghostings. Right? And that was a lot of people crashing last minute, a lot of lost opportunities. So these people are thinking about what their deepest objection is no matter what we have to say. So why are we gonna let them come up with their own fears of our products when we're the master of it? We should be able to know everything we do inside and out whether that be good or bad. So Alex sells he actually technically doesn't sell. He buys land from people who own houses, and he wants to, like, use their cell tower. Right? So you're calling people who own land that has this have cell towers on them. Towers on them. And you're basically calling them up and saying, like, hey. I wanna buy your land. This is how much I'm gonna pay you. Do you want it? Etcetera. Right? And so you call me up. Right? You're like, hey. You own this property in Texas. You have a cell tower on your land. I wanna pay you $200. Right? I give you some sort of objections. What types of questions are you actually asking me from there to figure out if I'm just a tire kicker or if you legitimately have a a selling opportunity here? So first off is you want to take small steps, like, almost, wide to narrow questioning. So you wanna make sure that when you are answering important questions that you've captured their full attention first. That it's not a part of the conversation where they're drifting off here, they're drifting off there. And so for me, what it may look like is, hey. When you purchased this property, was the tower sitting there already? Or is is this, an original lease that you negotiated yourself? And now what I'm gonna get there is people are either gonna say, hey. This tower has been in my family for fifty years. Right? We don't wanna do anything with it. Perfect. Have a great day. If anything changes, here's my number. Right? Or if someone says, hey. I bought this property five years ago. This tower thing is cool. I like the income, but it's it's just kinda there. Right? Now I can start to ask a few more questions around what's your knowledge of it. Right? Have you ever had anybody review your lease? And so I think if you you wanna put a a bow on that, it's clarifying questions. So clarify that they're actually asking what they're telling you because they may be asking you x because they wanna know y. So what's the real question? What's the real thing they're trying to find out from you? And most importantly for a seller, what's the thing that makes people wanna do business with you? Okay. So, Alex, I wanna talk a little bit about prospecting because the way that we first met and the reason you're on this show is kinda because you prospected me. We had a really good call, and then you ended up we had a good discovery call, whatever you wanna call it. And I realized you were really good, and you came on the show. And one of the things we first talked about in the first call you and I ever had is you are setting yourself apart at your org simply because of your prospecting. And I wanna hear a little bit about some of the things that you're doing from a a prospecting, cold calling, cold emailing perspective that you think have made you particularly effective. So the overall theme here is gonna be simplification. Simplify your cold calls, simplify your emails, simplify your voice mails. So let's start off with a call. Nearly every single cold call, my approaches, hi, my name, my company, and then I say what we do in one sentence or less. So you cold called me. I pick up. Hey. This is Nick. Yeah. Nick, hey. What's up? It's, Alex at a Tower Pointe. I was calling, about your property in, in Houston. Got a cell tower lease out there. It, looks like here. It's, right over at the intersection of, of Brown and and 1st. I'm in the right place for that. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I own that place. Me and my buddy, Arman, bought it last year. Okay. Perfect. So we at TowerPoint are actually nationwide sell site lease investors. So we purchase interest into these sorts of lease contracts. Have you ever had someone actually take the time, give you a formal valuation, even walk you through this opportunity to begin with? Beautiful. So, yeah, I see what you're doing. You're simplifying it really quick. You haven't used the word optimized once, and so I'm actually leaning in and saying, okay. I at least get what this guy does. So okay. That messaging is simplified. What are you seeing in an email? My emails could not be any more simple. I cannot remember the last cold email, and this is key here, cold. Right? Your first outreach. I can't remember the last cold email I sent longer than three or four sentences. My structure is very simple. It is subject line, address, hash, the person's name, which is a very underutilized skill in the subject line, put a hash mark in the person's name, try it today. In the body, Nick, I was passed in your direction about a tower at this address. Am I in the right place? Please confirm yes or no either way. Done. And now the goal here, right, what we have to remember as sales people is that our number one goal in Outreach before anything else is to get a response. If you don't get a response, you cannot do anything with that. So for someone out there thinking to themselves, hey. You showed all your cards. Why would you do that? You're gonna get a no. Well, that no someone sent me, I'm gonna get their cell phone number in the signature line of the email. I can call them up, and they they may be interested. Who knows? Secondly, I can quickly disqualify that person. If they send me back a paragraph and tell me to go screw off, cool. I'll I'll take you off the list. Or number three, right, you can always catch that person that has that intrigue, and then you're you're in the position of power. Well, one thing to say is, so I was looking at my inbox the other day, and I saw the name of my property. Nick and I invested in real estate together and dash Armand in my inbox, and I was like, what the is this? And I opened it, and it was freaking Alex sending me a test email. And that's how he got onto the freaking podcast as he freaking sent me that email. And I was like, what the is this? And I started reading it. I was like, wait, at the bottom of this, like, cell tower email, he's asking me to be on the podcast. And then it all started to make sense. And so it works, guys. It really caught my eye. So, anyways, Alex, you can keep going, man. Yeah. How, how how do you not open that email? I I guess is, I guess is the better question. And here's a cool one too because I've recently changed my stance on this a bit is voice mails. Cold outreach, I leave a voice mail every single time. If it's a later stage deal and you don't need to leave a voice mail, that's different. But cold outreach, I'm leaving an email every time. Rarely is it longer than ten seconds. Hey. It's Alex. Tower Point. Calling about the tower at this address. Give me a callback. And I'll keep going with this sprinkle in some emails here and there. Right? But every single time, I'm not changing that voice mail script, and here's why. The approach is is I expect you to call me back. I expect you to call me back. I don't care if I have to leave 10 voice mails, 15 voice mails, five voice mails. Hey. It's Alex calling about the tower. Hit me back when you get this. Almost every time when I do eventually get that person on the phone who I've left ten, fifteen voice mails to, they know me. Hey, Alex. I've been so busy. This and that. Right? 2020, COVID, whatever. Totally understand. Hey. I was calling about the tower. Right? And now you're back right into a conversation. So this kinda goes align with the the philosophy you've talked about, which is weaponizing your prospecting or weaponizing your outreach. And I think it's really interesting your philosophy on this. Can you tell us what that means? This is the mindset that as a salesperson, we do not wanna waste our time reaching out to people that aren't interested. So weaponizing your outreach is another way of encouraging disqualification. You call somebody up. Hey. Oh, man. It's, it's not a bad time, Alex. Give me a callback in two weeks. Well, hey, man. Look. Is it actually a bad time? Like or or you're just really not interested? You're you're not gonna hurt my feelings at all, and I don't wanna be making these calls anyway. Shut up. Another situation. Let's say, Nick, you've got a cell tower on your property in Houston. You sold the property a couple years ago. I call you up. Hey. It's Alex at a Tower Point calling about your, cell tower in Houston. Now keep in mind, Nick doesn't own this property. He hasn't for a couple years. His immediate thought is let me get this guy off the phone as quickly as possible. So what I'll do is I'll say something like, hey. Wait. Before you hang up on me, if you hang up and I don't get a new number to put in here, someone from my company is gonna be calling you in the future, and I know that you don't want that. You have someone's information here that I could put in instead. Works every time. It's actually really customer centric, and it sounds like it isn't. Right? It's weaponizing your outreach. And the first time I heard, I'm like, oh my gosh. This is gonna be like we talked about the double dial with Ken Amarr, and I was a little bit worried because I'm like, that's not super customer centric. I was like, weaponizing outreach, that sounds like a quadruple dial or something. But, actually, what you're doing is you're like, look, man. Like, I don't want somebody from my company to blow you up with a bunch of cold calls anymore. Can you tell me who I should actually be calling? Who'd you sell it to? Like, I do that a lot now when I'm trying to get competitive intel, when a customer says, oh, yeah. We're not interested. We're using a competitor. And I'm like, oh, okay. Well, I appreciate letting me know that. Would you mind letting me know who you're using? And the reason I ask is so I can put that in our CRM so we know not to bug you anymore. And oftentimes, they'll tell me somebody that I know, like, my company replaces a lot when we're selling our ERP system. So I'm leveraging that, hey. Don't wanna bug you to turning it into something that I can actually use in the future to help them. Right. And this all goes back to removing the friction. Right? We always have to remember that the person on the other end of the phone is trying to milk every second out of their day to do their job. They don't care about us. They don't care about our phone calls. And so if you need to get uncomfortable and let them know right away, get that quick no. Right? Because let's say you have that person that's on the fence. Right? I I call a tower guy. He's been on the fence for years. He gets bombarded. It's a little bit overwhelming. Right? And I call him up and I'll say something like, hey. Maybe doing the deal isn't right for you. It's right for some people. Maybe it's just not right for everyone. You know, Alex, you know what it's been this whole time, and then they'll give you the realness. So weaponizing your outreach, here's the approach. You don't wanna waste your time making phone calls to someone who's not interested. Your prospect doesn't want their time wasted. You have a mutual incentive to either move towards a deal as efficiently as possible or get off the phone as quickly as possible. You're hitting on a piece of negotiation almost, and you were telling us a funny negotiation story before this too where you started talking about your commissions and all that. And so you're you're being so blunt and direct. Now that we've gotten off of prospecting, when you're negotiating a deal, how are you using those same types of tactics? So here's an example. I was working with a gentleman. He was dead set on cashing in $200,000 for his tower. Market rate says a 175,000. We don't pull numbers out of hats for our valuations. They're very strictly based on purchase multiples. And so I've actually been working with this guy back since March. So I actually did walk away for multiple months, recently got back on track with him, And what he told me was, Alex, I'm gonna hold on until you you get to my 200,000 figure, which was entirely off the table. So then what I said is, look, we're talking about a really, really small gap here that we're trying to bridge. Right? The rent is $900. So a full year's of rent is adding about $10,000 to your purchase price. Right? So tier one towers are trading at 15 times. In this circumstance, we're able to push it all the way up to 17 times for specific circumstances that fortunately for you are met in this case, but there's no more room than that. I'm at the point where I'm barely even making 1% on the deal. It's so razor tight. And a response to that was, oh, okay. So I am really getting the most money possible. Yes. You are getting the most money possible. I'm about to be doing this for for charity if you, if you negotiate me up any higher. Right? So Nick and I used to run a vending machine company, and I don't know if you remember this one, Nick, but we would negotiate the heck out of our vending machine manufacturers. And it got to the point where this guy was so fed up with me. He's like, dude, I can't even take you, my wife, to Chili's with the amount of commission that I'm gonna make on this freaking deal. Alright? So you're either gonna take it or you're gonna go to China and have them make a machine for you. And I was like, alright. Shit, man. I'll take the deal from you. Yeah. He loved us over there. That guy really loved us, Armand. Isn't that what we all want, though? Don't don't we all just want a fair deal? I just wanna bloom an onion, man. I just wanna bloom an onion at Chili's. I I I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to afford one if we if we keep these these negotiations up. Alrighty, guys. We have gotten every episode in the world about handling objections, but Alex has done the opposite. He's inviting the objections. And so we talked about a lot of good habits, man, but let's talk about some bad ones. One bad one that every rep's gotta break. What is it? Stop answering the tough question for your prospects. When you ask the tough question, shut up, make them answer it. Alrighty, guys. Everybody shut up. Do you need to plug anything before we jump off? Follow me on LinkedIn. Connect with me on LinkedIn. Looking forward to hearing from everybody. Alrighty, folks. Everybody, hang on. Sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from the episode with Alex Bruske include, number one, use as few words as possible when answering a question. Number two, don't be afraid to walk away from a deal. It's okay to tell a customer that, hey. Like, dude, this might not make sense for you. Number three, stop tiptoeing around your discovery. Ask your biggest disqualifying questions first, and don't be afraid to do it. Shut up. And then lastly, my personal favorite, number four. When somebody says call me in six months, you can say, hey. It's okay to say no, Nick. And, honestly, I don't wanna be making these calls anyway. Nick, why should people help us out, or how should they help us out rather? Woah. How should they help us out? Well, look, this week, I wanna review. I'm going straight to it. Short words. No. I'm rambling. Please give me a review and write a really nice thing about the show. Thanks, guys.
