## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Froeck, and I'm here with my co host, Mark Koskalo. And today, we have someone who's on for their third round on thirty minutes to presidents club. He is first time on the leadership show. It is Florian Tetullia. He is the head of sales development over at Common Room, and this man is a machine when it comes to setting up prospecting systems that scale. Mark, why should people listen? There's only a dozen people on LinkedIn that I read almost every single one of their posts, and Florent is one of them. In this episode, we go deep into how does he use signal or intent based selling to drive outbound results for his team. He's an expert on it. Let's do it. In a three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, Florent. Welcome back to the show, but this time, the leadership show. We start every show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Number one, build your signal stack rank, for your team. Prioritization is super important when you think about who you're actually gonna be reaching out to in an account list. But you need to build a system where account prioritization happens, based on different levels of signals. So the number one signals that you should be focusing on are gonna be high intent signals that are time based. For us, web visits who's getting very specific high intent pages on your website, whether that's the demo page and they didn't book a demo, pricing page, t's and c's, the privacy page are all naturally gonna be very high intent. If you have a PLG motion, I think free trials or whatever you define as an activation is another one where you should be hitting up those specific people with messaging and and making sure that you're either getting them on a call or providing value up front quickly. Another one to to to give an example of high intent is socially engaged place. So when people are asking questions or discussing topics related to what you're selling, whether that's on like LinkedIn, on any other social channels in your, communities as well. And then you can start to, prioritize other types of signals such as the more common ones. So job changes, funding rounds, job listings. Those are not necessarily time based, and you need a creative approach to tie that trigger to the context for why you're reaching out to make sure that you're hitting people up according to the signal. What's number two? Number two is managers and executives should be multithreading key contacts with the reps. This is something that not enough managers and executives do in my opinion. And we've actually seen about a 25% increase in reply rates when we're sending very similar message from the peer out of an organization. If I'm a head of sales development, if I send a message to another head of sales development, the chance that that person is gonna respond to me is significantly higher than the same message coming from an SDR. The other thing you can do here is set up specific days where, you do prospecting, whether it's a three hour block or a full day blocks at various companies where the executives, managers, and the whole company is trying to break into accounts through their different networks. And I think, another important thing here is especially for executives, the reps should be writing those, emails or at least the framework so that executive can very quickly make the minor changes that they need to, but they don't have to build things from scratch. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Boom. Big fan of the exec to exec outreach. What do you got for number three? So number three is don't let your reps, dial alone. This is a big mistake in a more, remote world. I highly recommend that leaders invest in some form of a virtual sales floor so, you can listen it in on what prospects are saying. You can do this on something like Zoom. It becomes more difficult because, you're all talking over each other. People have to mute virtual sales floors where when a rep gets a pickup, it shoots them into another private room and then the team can go ahead and actually listen in on those calls. And then when everybody's done or as the team is collectively still dialing, you can coach in real time. That energy transfer of meet meetings being booked and actually coaching with everyone there and having real situations where you hear both sides of the conversation are are soo a super powerful, way to go about cold calling training. Alright, Florin. Let's get into some signal stuff because I know you're at a a company recognized for providing tons of great signals. I think that you're putting out a a bunch of content right now about signals. And I think that it's a very hot topic in sales. Help me get started. I'm somebody that is about to purchase or just purchased a tool like this. What are the first three to five signals that I should probably put into immediate use inside my SDR or prospecting org? I think there's, higher intense signals that every company should run-in. I would almost say that it's hell as irresponsible if you don't have some of these set up company, like website visitors and identification at the person level. There's, like, literally hundreds of solutions. I think when we checked on g two, it's like a 177. So being able to actually identify, like, the specific person that's on these high intent pages, like your pricing page, like the demo page, You should have some form of a workflow or at the very least an alert that signals to you when somebody is on that page in real time and set up a system where there's a rep actually reaching out to them at that point in time when it's still top of mind. If you have a free trial where, you're tracking some form of activation and you've hooked up multiple integration and opened up a certain amount of workspaces or invited different people, that's another, trigger that is super important to have set up. One that a lot of people have been doing somewhat manually, but is working really well for us is socially engaged signals. So we sell to sales teams. There's a lot of thought leaders, online, a lot of, different people on things like Substack on, different social platforms that are talking about topics where we believe we can come in and help these teams as a company common room. So we're tracking all these different posts, scraping the engagement, making sure that we're filtering for our ICP and reaching out to those people very quickly with some form of an insight as to how we're tying the context of that signal based outbound for us to our solution. So I have been on a website and within a couple of minutes, I've gotten an email that said, Hey, Mar, saw you were just on our website. I know you're not doing. So. Tell me what is the magic email you write to these de anonymized people that are on your website? I'm really glad you called that out, Mark, because one of the biggest mistakes that people do is they treat a signal as the reason for reaching out to someone. It doesn't actually work. A lot of people think it's creepy, especially if you've sold to non salespeople. They're like, how do you know I'm on your website? Right? Not everyone knows that this type of technology exists, and it's not a good practice. This is why I always teach people you don't wanna use a signal in isolation and make the fact that they're on your website the reason you are reaching out to them. So, typically, what I would, recommend is that you don't mention the fact that they're on your website at all. Look across other potential forms of intent or signals. Have they liked a post related to the topic? Has their CEO talked about a funding round or expanding into a new location. If you're an enterprise or look through their 10 k report, there's, like, ton of different softwares now that can help you, like, summarize that very quickly. You can build a compelling reason to reach out to somebody on your website fifteen minutes. That has nothing to do with the fact that they were on your website. It looks more as a coincidence. And because it's top of mind, it actually converts better. So customer comes on my site in some tool. I get a ping that this person's on my site. We route it to the right rep, and we provide them a a notification to go write an email. Do we write the email on their behalf and have them personalize it and send it? Take me through the workflow from Yeah. You've just identified somebody's on the site. So for, the workflow, I think there's automated ways you can do it with solutions, like common rooms. For example, when somebody is hitting your website, we will send a Slack alert right away. Then we're cross referencing against the book of business and pushing that into a specific sequence. For us at Common Room, we have a web visitor specific sequence. We try to break out messaging and sequences per, different signals, giving the rep the autonomy to do extra research. Essentially the way it works in a fully automated way is that person gets a notification and is already in a sequence ready to go. And then you're just customizing as needed. You don't have to do that in a fully automated, way. I think it's good to have at least a ping even if you don't have a solution like Common Room into your CRM, into Slack, wherever that is. And then just make sure that there's some form of an SLA for the rep that can be tracked so that they're getting to that person quickly, ideally within fifteen minutes. So there are different levels of automation for every sales leader. The most advanced level is a tool like that can do all of this for you. I would say the mid level automation is similar to what I did at Pave. We had a series of trigger templates and sequences set up in Outreach for if someone signed up for a webinar, downloaded a case study, or downloaded a compensation data report. We had our RevOps guy set up an automation where Outreach would automatically queue up a sequence based on whatever marketing intent signal had come through. So you can actually automate a lot of this stuff on your own. It's probably a lot more work, but you can build the stuff on your own. If you don't have those RevOps resources, you can take that trigger stack rank that Florin was giving you earlier and say for these top five intent signals, inside of your Outreach or your SalesLoft instance or your Gong engage instance, there is a trigger template that you can use for these five intent signals. And that is probably the biggest mistake that I see teams making, the five reasons. Then you have your entire team sending different messages and starting from complete scratch instead of getting them 80% of the way there so that they can bring it a 100% of the way there. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. So, Flora, my question to you is you've got this messaging framework and these trigger stacks. Where do you drop the SDR off, and how do you coach the SDR to work with one of these pre drafted templates? In other words, like, how much work should the SDR be doing after you've gotten it to this point? That's a it's a great question. The way I think about coaching SDRs from a messaging standpoint is provide them with some form of a framework and at least the basic template in in an email, let's say, or a cold call script. Right? And then it's up to them to adjust based off of what's happening in real time. Right? So let's use an example of a socially engaged signal where somebody commented on a sales thought leader's post that's related to something like a mutual success plan. Right? So I'm a digital sales rep. My framework typically is gonna be the first sentence is the observation based off of that signal. That can pretty much be somewhat templatized. Like, hey. Notice that you liked Brian Lemann as his post on mutual success plans. The second sentence is where the rep needs to adjust in real time, and that's the company wide signal or observation. It's like, what is specifically happening at that account in real time where you can tie the context of your solution to a problem that's happening at the account, not just the fact that somebody posted about mutual success plans. Like, that's not gonna close any revenue. And I think that's another key step that people are missing. Right? And then going into the ideal state, so what does your solution do like that pitch sentence? I also think that can somewhat be automated, but you can let the SDR change things up based off of whatever happened in that observation. So we give them the four sentence framework, and then they adjust, I'd probably say, about 50% of that given message. So the four steps, just to recap, is you have an observation based on a signal. For example, someone made a LinkedIn post. And then you turn that into a company wide observation. I noticed that your team is hiring. And then from there, you have the ideal state or the solution with some social proof and then a light call to action. It's sort of like what you were talking about earlier, which is if someone has opened up your email five times, it's really creepy if you just call out, hey. You opened up my email five times. And that also is not like, yeah. That makes me wanna buy your thing. It's like if someone is hungry and you run a taco stand, what do you do? You don't go look at them and say, hey. You're hungry. You show them the tacos, and you show them why their mouth should be watering. If someone's hungry, you don't go and just tell them that they're hungry. You show them how you're going to solve the problem for them, and that's what you're doing with your cold email framework. Oh, we're even worse, Armand. We're like, you're walking by by a taco stand. Come by. You're hungry. Yeah. Surprise. I always I have a Cine model. Any workflow that requires a human to do something is probably not gonna work over a long time and at scale. The human is always the problem. So you're sending off these things, you got this framework, they're in a sequence and a rep's not doing what they should be doing. They're waiting two days instead of fifteen minutes. Like they're not getting to it. How are you monitoring that? And then what do you do about it? I usually set up a specific SLA. So, obviously, when we're onboarding and we're coaching, there's gonna be specific SLAs, and we can actually track when the person hit a signal and got the alert to when the first message went out. And you could even set up reports, like, in your CRM to do that. For time based signals, it's so important that we can't get that wrong. So that's something that we're looking at on, me, on a daily basis, but we're definitely coaching on it at least in on a weekly basis in in the one on ones and making sure that that is, like, a key metric as important as number of touches that you're doing per week, number of calls I've, you've had, like, your talk time. I just think it's it's so important. And when I talk to different reps that have been my top performers, time between something a trigger happening and them reaching out is one of the main reasons the top performers are where they are compared to people that are are not. So, Florin, I believe that you're probably effective in one on ones and coaching people, but I also know there's reps that don't respond to that, still don't do the job. Would you be willing to stop them from getting a certain number of leads? You put them on a PIP. What is the escalation path to, you know, hey. You're not doing your job. Yeah. So I think, for us, it ultimately does come down to, like, that is your your job. So we are gonna put you, like, on a poor performance, improvement plan, and it's a key part of that time based thing is a key part to you hitting your actual, quota for us. So taking you off high single leads is not really, an option that I typically do. So it's very much like, hey. This is what your job requires you to do. If you're not gonna do that for x weeks in a row, then we're gonna put you on a PIP or, like, you just don't get it, and, we have to move on. What does a typical SLA look like for some of these higher intent leads? How quick are you expecting them to get to the leads? It depends on what the signal is. For something like web visits, for us, we have an ideal time within fifteen minutes, but the SLA itself is within an hour, which is what we're actually basing performance on. For something like a social like a socially engaged post, so you like something, that's more time based in twenty four hours, same with free trials. One mistake I see a lot with free trials is like, I'll sign up for something and then a rep reaches out to me right away. I haven't even used your product, so I'm not ready to be sold to. For those, we also leave twenty four hours usually. So if we assume that some leads are less hot, and it might be twenty four hours, but other leads are, like, fifteen minutes time to first touch. My cranky old man stopped looking at your email, stopped being inside of Slack. Person inside of me says, this is horrible for time blocking. I want my SDRs doing deep work. I want them dialing 60 people in a row for an hour straight without opening their Slack notifications or looking at what other leads have come in. I want them going deep and making sure that they're doing one step to prospecting workflow for an hour straight without constantly getting pulled aside for a lead. How would you respond to someone where they feel like their SDRs are getting distracted by chasing random high intent leads? Yeah. So there's a few ways to solve for this, and I think it depends on the the resources that you have. One option is to segment your team where you have more of, like, an inbound based SDR that's gonna focus on higher intent time based leads. Right? The second option is more of a a hybrid approach where the minimum time frame that we it was at least an hour. Typically, you can do a call block for thirty minutes, especially in days where you have the power dialer. You can get out a 100 calls in thirty minutes. So you still have time within that one hour block to reach out to all the people you have to. Those are the two options that teams typically struggle with. And even for us, like, we're a small team. We're four or five SDRs, so it doesn't make sense for us to fully segment right now. It's more of a hybrid approach with the understanding that if you're gonna do a call block for thirty minutes, you still have time to get to those leads. So my only last question on this is, what do you define as time to first touch? Naturally, they're gonna send out this email, but do you track speed to first cold call as well, or is it just they gotta get an email out as quickly as possible? The way that I've designed my sequences, it's a three burst, like, first touch, essentially. So it's always the email that's first. It's the easiest one to to really track. So we send an email. The next, step is gonna be the call, and then there's some form of a LinkedIn touch as well. So that that's how we track, and it's always the email first. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. So, Lauren, I think something that I was super interested in, and honestly, I don't think I mastered when I was at Catalyst was this digital or virtual sales floor. And you mentioned that in your three things is like, don't let people dial alone. Help me understand how you organize call blocks and calling with reps in this virtual sales room environment. Take me through the tooling and how how you organize it. Yeah. So there's a number of different solutions that work well. One of my favorites is Nook's. We all go in this virtual sales floor. We usually have, at least where me as a manager comes into the call blocks once or twice a week, usually like Tuesdays and and Thursdays, we'll do call blitzes. There's even a Spotify integration so we can get our music going. We get everybody amped up and then, we just start dialing. The good thing is the dials are happening in the background as we're having conversations. And you're just trying to mimic what you used to be able to do in the office. It's crazy that a lot of people haven't even had an office in Enviro to really see what that feels like, but the energy is so different. Like when someone books a call that is infectious to other people. And even if you get somebody that passes you offer something, you all just laugh about it. And I think there's something about that energy that we have never been able to replace, but I think virtual sales floors are really the closest thing that we have been able to get to. And then when someone's done with the call and people have listened to actually having a bit of a mini retro in real time. It's like, hey, how do you think that went? And then usually the rep as they're more stuff where with the virtual sales for the, like, I screwed up this objection or this is what I should have done differently. You have a bit of a conversation and everyone's still dialing and it just that momentum builds and builds over time. And it really is infectious. So when you say call blitz, I think that there's a million definitions of call blitz. Tell me about your call blitz. How does it work? You do it twice a week. That feels like a lot. Help me take through your thinking on call blitzes. I as a manager that only has four or five people right now, I think I can afford two thirty minute blocks. So Tuesdays and Thursdays, for me, that's a super important part of enabling and and showing the team that I'm also there, with them, and we're doing that coaching live. I don't think it's too much to do that twice a week. For more critical coaching, I would do a separate one on one where it's like, hey, clearly, when I'm looking at the metrics, like, you're struggling with, like, you know, pitch to conversation, which is a specific part of the a call that we're tracking through our reporting and and outreach and alti sales actually. Right? So that's when we would do more of, like, the reps where I think about it almost like the analogy where you're never gonna actually run a whole basketball game in practice. You're gonna do, like, a 103 points in a row. So if you're struggling with your specific pitch or your opener or one specific objection, I'm gonna sit with that rep separately so that we can have a critical conversation and run that and repeat it, like, 50 times in a row until you've nailed it. Yeah. We had KD on the show a while back, a number of times, and he talks about how it's a huge mistake, how most teams are practicing in the game. And if you think about the average in the game, and if you think about the average connect rate, which is 5%, if you get stuck on a certain competitor once, that literally one every 20 dials, you're going to get some objection. The chances that the one person that picks up is going to give you that same competitor again even this week is extremely low. So take it, practice it 25 times with your manager with another rep, and then move on. Yeah. Lauren, the other thing I wanted to ask about when it comes to the management of these is it sounds like these are pretty dived. In other words, someone picks up the phone and the team is listening. They're stopping what they're doing and listening in on the dials. My guess is the purpose of this sounds like it's more of a team building and a training exercise versus the goal of this is not to get everyone to hit their dial commitment in these hours together. Right? So do you have, like, separate dial blocks that are so low versus these team ones? So the reps all do their call blocks every single day without anybody else in the room. Got it. The good thing about platforms like Nook's is that you have a virtual sales floor and it's also a parallel dialer. Within thirty minutes, usually, everyone gets, like, a 100 plus calls, which was just not possible to get to before. So I think it's a really healthy way to balance both of those things. Great. And for folks who are listening, NUCs is one. Orem is another. We happen to work with them, but there are tons of really good tools. And, these parallel dialers, especially if if you have a big territory, it is mind blowing how many more cold calls you can make in a week just by dialing multiple people at once. Florent, this was an awesome show. We have to move to the final question, and it is this. We talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit. But what is one bad habit that all sales leaders should break so that all teams get a little bit better out there? We get so many sales leaders that come to us, and they're just like, we have this mandate at our company to look into different AI tools, and we wanna implement something. And then you ask them, what are you actually trying to do with AI? What's the problem that you're trying to solve? And a lot of leaders, like, actually struggle to answer that. So don't get caught up, like, in the hype, just because it's AI. There should be some glaring problem that you have at your organization that you're trying to solve. If AI can help you get then that's fine, but don't just blindly purchase solutions or start evaluating different things and wasting your time for things that might not be broken or you just don't even know what you're looking for. AI only helps you suck at scale as a team if you don't know the fundamentals. Think about that. Don't suck at scale. Amazing show, Florent, thank you for the words of wisdom on the way out. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Mark. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Florent Tautilya. What do you have for your two? Number one is I love how he buckets signals into categories and then has different SLAs for each one. For example, those timing based signals that must be replied to immediately versus things that are just more interesting and don't have to be prioritized as quickly. I thought that was really interesting. Secondly, you know, I love call blitzes, but I've only ever done one a week at the most. Doing multiple call blitzes, getting on that virtual sales room floor, getting the music pumping, having people laugh at people that are responding crazily in cold calls. I think that that is just an amazing cold call culture. And you and I both know, Armand, like, the phone is the ATM machine. You push the buttons and money comes out. Number three. If you're running a taco stand and someone walks by your taco stand, you don't say, hey. You're hungry. You show them the sizzle on your carne asada, and that is what gets someone who is hungry to walk through the doors. And so if someone is opening your email five times, you don't say, hey. You're opening my email five times. You go take that as a high intent prospect, and then you go find another trigger to use in your personalized outreach, and you send that. And then lastly, number four, Florin had some really smart ways that he automated the first touch. He had a four sentence email framework, which is an observation based on a signal into a company signal, into an ideal state solution with social proof, and with a light call to action, get your reps 80% of the way there, and then have them use that framework to bring it a 100% of the way there. Alrighty, folks. If you like this one, a while back, I wrote a newsletter on how to personalize cold emails at scale, and a lot of the principles from this episode will apply in terms of how you write an 80% email for your team and then how you can give your team those last 20% templates. So go check it out, and we will catch you on the next one. Peace.
