## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have, again, for a second time, the one and only, the touted Hillel Batraui. He is the king of death to fluff, and he is the king of delighting us today. Nick, why should people delight themselves? Well, so if you're the type of salesperson who's like, hey. I can't tell you pricing until I talk to your boss or no. No. No. We're not doing the demo until I do some discovery. You probably wanna listen to Bilal because he will teach you why that actually causes you not to delight your buyer, and he's got some great strategies to delight your buyer, which actually is correlated with winning deals. Three, two, one. Delightful. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, Bilal. Welcome back to the show. You remember we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. So let's get some Veth the fluff, real actionable advice here. So number one, there are three fundamental rules for great messaging. Alright? And and these are three things you have to think about before you click send. Number one, it has to be about them, not you. Change the language. No I, we, us, you, you phrasing. Number two, it's gotta be emotional because decisions start in the limbic brain. So limbic brain messaging is an emotional plea, whether that's, comedy, curiosity, anxiety, FOMO, whatever it is, make it emotional. It has to make some connection. And the third thing is it cannot be about saving time or money. This is where most sellers fall into the quicksand. Because time and money is what sellers say to buyers. You fall into a paradigm of buyer seller, and people tune you out. So don't make it about saving time or money. Alright? So those are the three fundamentals for great messaging. Number two, ROI sucks. Like, get off ROI. The problem with ROI is that it speaks to the neocortex, which is where decisions get concluded, not start. The limbic brain is where where decisions start. And the limbic brain is the emotional brain. It's the part of the brain that's responsible for fight, flight, or freeze. So ROI is not something to lead with. What you want to lead with is opportunity cost, the cost of inaction, what it costs you if you don't make a change, if you remain on the status quo, if you stay on thin ice. What could happen to you? Start there. If they buy into that and they see the concept and you can get commitment, then you can move to ROI and say, now here's the impact of the change. But there's really no reason to talk about ROI if they're not willing to make a change in the first place. So start with opportunity cost. And the third one is mic drop questions when you're on a cold call. So I've noticed this pattern over the years of selling that when I get people talking early and upfront in a cold call, the likelihood of success of a positive outcome, whether that's a follow-up or a meeting set, increases dramatically. Then when I'm doing all the talking in some sort of monologue and they're just listening. So how do you get people talking early upfront? Ask a mic drop question. Get the mic out of your hands, leave center stage, and put them in center stage. And it sounds something like this. It's gonna be what or how questions. Like, how do you handle your second largest cost of benefits rising nine to 15% year over year? Or what method do you use today to track user frustration on your website? Those are what or how mic drop questions that get the spotlight off you and onto the prospect. So can we talk about everything leading up to the mic drop questions? I don't I think we talked mostly about popcorn in the last episode with Bilal. And if you didn't see that one, definitely go back and listen to popcorn. That's all I'm gonna say. But, like, what's happening leading up to the mic drop question? I know you have a a special framework around cold calling. I do. This is like there's some psychology behind why it flows like this, but the idea is pretty simple. K? It's four steps. So number one, permission. Permission based opener. Let people know you're cold calling them. Never leave them thinking, wait. Is this a sales call? Is this somebody I know? It's better to be the one to address that early and upfront. The one that I was taught years ago by MJ Hoffman and I still use still today is, I know you're not expecting my call. Do you have a moment? I promise to be brief. Alright? That's exactly how I say Very confidently, I say my name. I usually make a little joke about my name. I'm like, hey. This is Bled. They're like, who is this again? I'm like, wait. Am I the first Bled to call you today? And then they crack up, and everybody around me groans because they've, like, heard that joke for, like, the tenth time that day. But then I say, I know you're not expecting my call. Do you have a moment? I promise to be brief. I wanna get permission. Alright? They say yes. Proceed. They say no. I say, oh, no problem. When would you like me to call you back? Would later this afternoon or tomorrow morning be better for you? Letting them know, like, hey. You're not getting off scot free if you say no. I'm gonna call you back. And I and I I stick to my word. If if they tell me call back tomorrow morning, I call them back tomorrow morning. Alright? So there's the permission. Then I'm gonna frame a problem. Nothing about my company. Nothing about what we do, who we are, who we serve, our customers, none of that. I wanna frame a problem. I wanna get their attention. So this is, like, the first twenty seconds of the cold call once they say, okay. What's this about? Be dead. Then I'm gonna say something like this. So in the case of, like, TriNet, the first startup I worked at, we sold HR tech. We sold it to CFOs of fast growing tech companies. This was the pitch. For most businesses like yours, the second largest cost after payroll is health benefits, which have been increasing nine to 15% year over year in the state of California. So there, I just frame the problem. Alright? At FullStory, we used to sell software that helps people track user behavior on websites and apps, so So we are selling to product managers. In that case, I'd say something like this. Have you ever been on a website that really sucked where you found yourself slamming your mouse in frustration? We call that a rage click, And that might be happening right now on your website. So now I'm framing a problem. Okay? Now there's a reason I'm giving you the TriNet example, the full story example. I'll get to that in a second. So we've got permission, problem. Now we're gonna do mic drop. Alright? I'm gonna ask a what or how calibrated question that gets me off the hot seat and gets them talking because we don't wanna talk anymore. Right? I need them to talk. I want them to embrace the problem I just stated or reject it because I'm fine with either. Right? If somebody tells, hey. That's not my problem. Oh, wow. Great. That's unusual. Before I let you go, how did you overcome that? I'd love to learn. Right? So it's totally okay if that's not their problem. You wanna know that in the first twenty seconds of the cold call so you're not wasting your time with somebody that's never gonna buy from you. But if they agree and they embrace the problem, now you have a discussion. So you wanna ask that what or how question. I call it a mic drop question. So it sounds something like this. Case of TriNet, going back to that, how do you handle your second largest cost increasing nine to 15% year over year? And now it's on the CFO to answer. And most of the time, the response is, wait. Who is this again? Because the question is so finely tuned and precise, they're shocked that in the first twenty seconds of a cold call, some random stranger just asked them this mission critical question. And when that happens, you just repeat. Be dad calling from TriNet. I know your second largest cost is benefits after payroll. Wondering how do you handle your second largest cost increasing nine to 15% year over year. And in the case of full story, the question was, how do you see today when people are rage clicking on your product? Right? And you pause. So that now you got the mic. You you just mic drop. It's not you anymore speaking. You put it on them, and you did it within twenty seconds. And people embrace. They embrace the problem because then they say, you know, we've talked to our broker about that or, yeah, that's come up before. You know? Mine's even been more than 15%. Ours was, like, 18% last year. Or the product manager says something like, we don't have a way to do that. Or we try to track things in Google Analytics, but I don't think it has that rage click thing you just described. And now a conversation starts. Hello. Can we talk about how that conversation progresses? Because what I usually do on my cold calls is when I get to the, you know, okay. Tell me why you called. I tell them, hey. We can help with the problem I think you have. What you're doing is you're just saying, here's a problem, and you're curious about how they're solving it. So let's say that product manager replies and says, yeah. We don't really have a way to track that today, and and I am kinda struggling with that. Do you start to then pitch your thing and explain how you can help? How does the conversation progress so that you can book a meeting? Yeah. So there's this famous quote that I always remind myself and anybody who's worked on my teams knows this quote. It's from the famous, Muslim scholar Rumi, and he says, trade your cleverness for bewilderment. So trade your cleverness for bewilderment. This is the part to be bewildered by whatever they say. Be surprised. Be curious. Really? Tell me more about that. Or what does that mean? So the product manager says, we use Google Analytics today, but I don't think it tracks that. Really? So what are you tracking? Right? I wanna get you talking. I wanna get an understanding of what's going on with the situation because you just embraced the problem I described. So now I have some curiosity from you. I have you on center stage, and now all of a sudden, I'm asking questions when before you were asking question of who is this and why are you calling me? Right? In twenty seconds, we judo flipped it from me being in the spotlight having to explain myself to now you're explaining yourself. And you've allowed me that you've embraced it because you've acknowledged the problem that I stated. And because it was such a calibrated question, you felt the need to address it. Right? Now I told you there's a difference too between the TriNet question and the full story question because this is something that, as a seller, I was never taught in the six sales trainings that I ever did, which is, is your product viewed as net new versus rip and replace? Right? Because some products are rip and replace, and some products are viewed as net new. Sometimes the same product can be both in different segments. Right? SMB, it might be net new. Enterprise, it might be rip and replace. That's fine. But you need to know when you're calling that prospect what the expectation is. Because in the case of TriNet, we were always ripping and replacing their broker. That's why I asked about the nine to 15% year over year because I know they're using a broker already. I'm already I've already made the assumptions. I know you have a broker. I know they're not doing their job very well, and I know you're seeing a very large increase in benefits costs. Right? It's all assumed within that question. In the case of full story, most product managers didn't use a session replay tool like we sold. So I'm pointing out to something they can't do because they don't have my products. And I'm saying, how do you handle that today? Piquing their curiosity to be like, I don't. How do I? Go on. Right? So that's a very different pitch, but it's the exact same framework. We're still going permission, problem, mic drop. But we're framing the question, the problem differently in both scenarios based on whether it's rip and replace or net new. I don't know if we've ever talked about competitors from a phone standpoint. And so let's say, like, hey. You're calling us TriNet, and they're like, okay. The nine to 15% thing totally makes sense for us, but, like, we're currently using this broker, this provider that isn't TriNet today. How do you handle that without just slinging mud the entire time or getting into, like, a feature checklist on the phone? So the first thing you wanna do is understand well, just from a selfish standpoint, when does your contract with that current vendor end? Right? Now this goes counterintuitive to what we read on LinkedIn and stuff of, like, it always has to be about them. It also I give value, sell value, and all this stuff. It's like, wait a second. If this person's contract just renewed, right, January, and I'm calling them in, like, March, my timing sucks. So that gives me perspective on where their mindset is at. If their contract is gonna renew in June, and here we are in, like, May, I'm like, well, I'm in a good spot here. Right? I'm gonna I'm gonna lean in a little bit more in this conversation. So the first thing I wanna figure out is, like, where's their mindset at? If you're window shopping, there's a discussion to be had there to give you the sizzle without the steak, get you excited, but follow-up at the appropriate time. If you are in buy mode, then I wanna give you the sizzle and the steak and really lay into it. So if if they are coming up on something, then I wanna say, well, how are you gonna evaluate your choices as we get closer to that time frame? Right? Like, how are you gonna do it? Are are you gonna just bring a bunch of vendors in and take a look side by side? Do you feel like you're already gonna make a switch? Like, walk me through that. And the reality is that you get you get the right to ask that question when they're willing to concede that the timing on their current vendor is at or near ending. Right? So the to me, that's that's the right approach. And, again, it's really hard to do if you don't do the mic drop question in the beginning because you don't have the right to ask that question if you weren't having a discussion with them prior. Right? But when you use this method and you've got them talking five, six, seven minutes and asking them questions, it's a lot easier to be like, well, what do we do next? You tell me. Because it sounds like you're interested in this. Can you give me some context as to what's going on today with your current solution? Bilal, can you talk about how you formulate that mic drop question? Because, hopefully, the folks listening to this have solutions that solve more than just one problem. Like, in the case of the thing I sell, we solve about 800 different things. There's so many different modules and combinations of what I can sell. I'm sometimes scared to articulate just one problem because if they don't have that one problem, well, shoot. There goes my cold call. What do I do? Alright. That's a great question, Nick. So let's let's back it up for a second. Don't think about problems per se. Think about personas. So TriNet was the same way. We had a multifaceted solution that did a bunch of different things for the HR people, for the controller, for the CFO, for everybody. But I wasn't calling all those people. I was calling just the CFO. And I was trying to get the attention of the CFO fast. And I knew that their second largest cost increasing that much is pretty crazy. So I started with the persona first. What mattered most to my persona? What problem did I know was pretty universal, pretty across the board that would get that conversation started? Because, again, the mic drop question is just a means to an end. It's not the pitch for your solution. It's it's the provocation to start a dialogue. Right? Ditch the pitch, get off the monologue, start a dialogue. So that's the only purpose of that question. How do you get a dialogue started with that person? In this in the same lens, that's what it was at FullStory with a product manager. Right? I knew the product manager was responsible for product releases, for bugs, for user experience. So when I ask a question of, like, how do you track this user experience that you can relate to? Because I just said, have you ever been on a website where you slam your mouse in frustration? We call that a rage click. Now I've labeled and framed the problem. I gave it a name. I say, how do you track that knowing that you can't unless you have a session replay tool? So now I've framed it. Right? But the bigger context of what FullStory did was way, way larger than that. It got me a conversation, though, a seat at the table to get into that. And, you know, this is another piece of advice that I hear on LinkedIn a lot that I hate. It's one of my pet peeves, which is never be the one to hang up. I fundamentally disagree on a cold call. I think there's such power in a seller cutting off the conversation instead of dragging it out. I mean, you do your mic drop. They start talking. You ask some questions. To Armin's point, they might bring up their current vendor. You find out some timing things, and then they wanna get into the solution. Well, how do you handle that? Right? Hey. Vinet, you never told me how what you guys do. Honestly, look. Well, it sounds like you're interested. It sounds like there's a problem here, and I want to this is the fourth part of the the process. Right? Because there's a four step method. We've got permission, problem, mic drop, and then promise. I'm gonna uphold the promise I said. Look. I called you, and I know I caught you out of the blue, and I promise to be brief. It sounds like you're interested in this. Would you be willing to give this a proper conversation next week or two for thirty minutes to an hour? I'm gonna be the one to pull away. And then they're like, woah. I was not expecting that. That's not what salespeople do. Salespeople try to pitch me. Salespeople try to tell me how they're gonna help me save time and money and make you know, they're they're they wanna play the hero, and I'm the damsel in distress. That's not what this guy is doing. This guy's sit stepping back and telling me, would you wanna do this properly? And the majority of people will. They'll say, you know what? Yeah. I think I will take a call. I'd be interested. Well, could you send me some information prior to that so I I have some context? Absolutely. Winworks to set that up. Right? I will add that information in the calendar invite. So now you're setting that meeting. Successful cold call or a follow-up. Because, again, in Armin's point, if they tell you if they if they have a current vendor, the timing is not right, then I say something like, well, look. We're not even the right time frame. I should probably call you back '3. So how about I send you some information so you have my contact details, and I reach out to you then? That interrupts the expectations that they have on how a seller should behave on a cold call. So I love how you're tying this all together, and you're constantly pushing away. And I know you've talked about this before too. Once you get into that discovery call, you have some things around transparency selling where where you'll actually say, hey. These are the places that they're better than us. So at yeah. Great point. And, again, I always go back to I wanna unexpectedly delight my buyer. I wanna unexpectedly delight them. And when you really look at it critically, there's only a handful of areas where a seller can unexpectedly delight a buyer. Here are the areas that I that I see. Competition, pricing, process, and shortcomings of the product. That's pretty much all you got. It's a not very big playing field. You don't have a lot of tools in your toolkit. Buyers expect sellers to not share those four things, to make those things difficult to get, to make them, like, have to jump through hoops. So if I preemptively bring those things up, I completely change the dynamic. Now this goes back to one of the six universal principles of influence by doctor Cialdini. Right? This goes back to one of those principles, which is the principle of reciprocity. So they did a study where they were trying to boost the tip that waiters get at the end of a meal. Alright? So in the default group, the control group, the waiter gives the bill, gives a mint, walks away. Tips are average. In the second group, the waiter gives two mints instead of one. Tips go up a little bit marginally. In the third group, the waiter gives a tip or gives the bill, gives a mint, walks away, then turns around and says, for you nice people, here's an extra mint. Tips go through the roof. Why? Because of that unexpected delight of getting an extra mint and feeling special. So I, as a seller, can use these four things. Again, pricing, competition, process or setup, and then shortcomings of my product as my mints. Now when I give pricing in a disco call upfront like that, I never give a specific number. The way I do it is I say, here's where pricing starts, so they have a a semblance of a floor. So there's some expectation. Like, this is not gonna be less than 15 k. And, typically, for companies of your size, I see it more in the range of 25 to 32. There's about six factors that go into that. I can cover them later. Let me pause for a moment. What's your initial reaction to that? That's how I give pricing up front. Right? So I give myself wiggle room later to still make a deal of it. Same thing with competition. Look. We're you're about one Google search away from knowing who we work, against, who our competition is. Let me let you know who those are. And if you like, I can tell you some of the advantages that they have and disadvantages that they have because we're not right for everyone, and sometimes you are might you might be better off going with them. People are like, woah. Right? That's that's the waiter turning around and give me an extra mint. I was not expecting that. So one of my concerns, Bilal, is I'm in this meeting. Right? And let's say I cold called Armand, and he's like, I'm kinda interested in your solution. Like, can we can we talk about this right here? And I say, you know, you make the promise and I booked that meeting in in two weeks. And I show up into that meeting and Armand's there and Armand has brought one of his colleagues and that person is there in the meeting and it's a two versus two versus one. It's two people on his and me having this conversation. This other person might not have a ton of context about, like, the reason that we have this meeting and how we might be able to help. And one of the things, like, my CRO is harping on right now is we gotta talk about pain. We have to talk about about the pain the buyer has and where we can help solve them. And I'm always with you in terms of, like, I wanna delight them, but I'm worried if I don't talk about it all about how we can help, they're gonna be like, okay, well, we're just in the mechanics and the weeds of the sale as opposed to problem they are looking to solve. And I'm wondering what the heck do you think about that? Yeah. That's that's a great point. And it it is really hard when when the buyer brings in somebody else or you're now dealing with a buying committee and multiple stakeholders because pretty much everybody that comes in is you have to sit you have to hit reset. You have to hit reset on them. And and that's okay because when you think about the universal buyer's journey, which is something, again, my sales training has never taught me, people go through five stages to buy something. Unaware, aware, consideration, evaluation, decision. So your champion might be in consideration or evaluation. They bring in somebody new, and they're starting off from unaware. So it's like, well, this is not a level playing field. And I think it's fair to state that. Right? To to right at the beginning of the call, be like, hey. I know you and I spoke, Nick, and I appreciate you inviting Armin. I I'd imagine, Armin, you have some context from Nick, but maybe not a lot. Let me pause for a moment. What do you know so far about this meeting? I wanna get some context from you and find out, okay. You don't know anything. Right? Nick just sorta, like, threw in on the calendar. Okay. No problem. Well, look. Before I begin into what the typical agenda for this meeting was, let's just hit pause for a moment. I'd love to get your impression, Armin, of the status quo today. What's going on today? And how do you see it? And I'm gonna be upfront about the fact that the easiest thing to do is nothing. Like, I'm gonna acknowledge that your team, your company is getting the job done today. Like, before I ever called you, you were a successful business. That's why I called you. And you will continue to be a successful business the second I hang up. But I wanna understand your view of the status quo if you see issues with it, because then I can catalyze, I can enable on that and and and create some urgency around why that might be shaky ground. Right? That might be thin ice. There might actually be a problem with that. And that's where you wanna use some provocative messaging to kind of get people understand that the status quo is risky. So I'm gonna always start when I have a new person in the meeting. How are you getting the job done today? What's your view on that? Because if if Armin comes in and says, I don't see an issue with it. I think we're doing fine. This is how I do it, and it's all good for me. I'm gonna look at you, Nick, and be like, what do you want me to do? Right? Like, you you're the one who wanted to do this meeting. You said there's a problem. Armin doesn't. I think you two need to figure that out. I'm doing my part to create this relationship. Now you gotta do yours. Because elite sellers know, and this is something average sellers struggle with, elite sellers know the majority of a sale is buyer side driven, not seller side driven. Right? Like, for example, we've been talking about pain. Am I the one driving pain? Do I call up people and, you know, and and and create pain for them? Yeah. Probably by annoying them, but that that's about the extent. Right? They gotta they gotta have a pain. They've gotta be willing to identify it. They've gotta be willing to change, and they've gotta be willing to agree that there's gonna be an impact in making that change. All of that's buyer side. A seller can't do any of that. If I could, I wouldn't be here right now. I'd be on some beach, you know, sipping a pina colada. I listen back to all of our finished products of our podcast usually once. This is what I'm gonna have to listen to probably three times. This has been such a good episode, and we're running out of time. So we gotta move to the final question now. So my final question for you is this. We've talked about a lot of really good habits that salespeople should be living out in their interactions with buyers. And now I wanna talk about a bad habit. So I'd like to hear from you. What do you think is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople leaning on heavily that they shouldn't be because it's hurting them more than it helps? Oh, that's a good one. What's a bad habit? Sellers are too afraid to disqualify. They have a mindset of qualification instead of disqualification, which is a very different mindset to have. Poke problems. Like, poke the problems upfront. When somebody tells you something that's suspect, point that out. Like, there should be no reason to say again, like, if if I'm talking to somebody and they bring up something and I'm like, you know what? People who buy my product don't typically say that. I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you that. Hey, Nick. It's interesting you brought that up. I'm gonna trade my cleverness for bewilderment. I'm surprised you brought that up. Typically, the people I speak with say x. You just said y. Can you help me understand why you're talking y instead of x? I wanna figure that out upfront because that might end up being a disqualifier. That might be a deal breaker, and deal breakers go both ways for the seller and the buyer. And when I look at the stats around how more than a third of sellers deals on average and sometimes depending on the stat you look at, it's up to 70% of deals end up in status quo no decision. That's a boatload of wasted time. That's some cost. You will never get that time. You can recoup money. You can recoup resources. You can't recoup time. Every minute you spent selling somebody that didn't buy was a minute less you had for the actual people who could. And that's the difference between elite and average sellers and how they manage the clock, how they manage their time. So stop having a mindset of qualification. Start having a mindset of disqualification. And and that goes back to that quote, cleverness for bewilderment. Be curious. Dig in. Find out what's going on and get the ones that aren't going to buy out fast. Like, fail fast. I love it. Everybody, start acting bewildered. It's easy for me. Might be a little bit tougher for some of the smart ones out there. Bilal, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? I am planning to launch a free, series on YouTube about the mic drop method. I'm gonna open source it. I'm bringing it to the world. I'd greatly appreciate if you guys sign up because you'll be the first notified. You'll be able to check it out. And, of course, I want feedback, good man and ugly. There you go. Sign up for the mic drop method. Pick up the phone. Cold call Bilal. Give him a little bit of feedback, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Bilal include, number one, when somebody asks you, who's this or what is this call regarding, you don't have to freak out every time. You can crack a joke. Bilal likes to say, what? Am I the only Bilal who's called you today? You'll get a laugh, and then you key can keep going on. Number two. You have to trade your answers for bewilderment. Do not always jump right into the solution for every single prospect question. You need to ask the question behind the question. Number three, there are many ways you can delight your buyer. Every rep tries to hide product, hide pricing. And if you can say that stuff up front and say, like, hey. By the end of this call, we will run through a demo so you'll actually see the product, and I'll give you a sense of what this costs. You will delight your buyers. And then lastly, number four, use your mic drop questions in your cold calls. It's really hard to answer not interested when you show that you're an industry expert and you say, hey. This is something we're seeing in your space. How are you handling that stuff? Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us? Well, the biggest thing that delights me when I'm procrastinating making cold calls is going on to LinkedIn and seeing the notification bell all lit up, clicking that notification bell, and then seeing people have posted publicly nice things about thirty minutes to Presidents Club. So if you wanna delight me, I don't know, make a post about it if you like the show. It truly would make me a happy guy. Thanks for listening. We'll see you guys next week on thirty minutes of Presidents' Club.
