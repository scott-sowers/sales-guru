## Transcript

What most people do when they are handling objections is they try to handle the objection. They try to fight the objection. And if you've ever had someone try to change your mind, the number one thing that I can do to not change your mind is I can tell you that you're wrong. K? And that's what most sellers do when they hear an objection. If someone says, like, I'm not interested, they start, like, pitching harder, and they're like, well, like, here's why I believe the solution that we bring is more valuable than what you're using today. Or if someone is, like, citing a competitor, you'll say, like, oh, well, that competitor is not good for reasons like this, this, and this, and other customers saw the value because of this, this, and this. And the customer starts kicking away because, like, usually when someone gives an objection, it's because they've made a decision to do things a certain way, and that way was not your way. And so when you fight that objection, you're fighting the way that they do things. Okay? And so that's why the first step of handling any objection is to pattern break, and you're actually going to agree with the objection. So let's pretend that someone gives us a competitor as an objection. Okay? And so for the sake of Covey, let's assume that they're using some other resume screening bot, right, of which there are many. So I'm gonna say something like this. I should have assumed you had something in place because, honestly, like, screening thousand resumes would be a huge pain. And I'm not gonna lie. Like, usually, when you have a bot in place, like, it doesn't even make sense to switch off of it. So they're like, is this person not gonna sell me? That's what happens when you agree with the objection is, like, you release pressure. Step number two is you need to incentivize conversation. I don't have enough information to handle this objection yet, and I need to start to get them talking. When people start talking, they tend to feel comfortable. The job of a good therapist is to get their person talking. If the therapist is doing all the talking, then the person will start to clam and be like, don't give me advice. Don't solve my problem for me. Like, part of the reason therapy works is, like, they get you to talk yourself into the right solution. Right? And so we're gonna do some, like, sales therapy here, and we're gonna do something really slick. So here's the secret with competitors. I need to ask them a trap question, and I need to know, like, at least one trap question per competitor. What that means is I need to think of what is one thing that my competition can't do that I can do. And then I'm just gonna ask them how they do that thing so that they come to the answer on their own terms. So in the case of Covey, a lot of times, someone's existing recruiting software will have, like, an AI bot attached to it, but it's, like, pretty crappy. It's like glorified filters. Right? And there are certain things that you can't look for. Like, you can't look for, like, someone who got multiple promotions in a short period of time, like, trajectory or worked for, like, certain blue chip type of companies. And so I'm just gonna, like, ask that in a trap question. So I'm gonna say like, hey, Jane. Just so no one from my team calls you again, I noticed that your team is, like, hiring a bunch of, like, software engineers, and I have to assume that in the bot, you're able to do things like point out the human level nuance of things like quick promotions over a certain number of years or worked for, like, blue chip tech companies in this industry or, like, worked for both big companies and small companies so they've seen scale in startups. Like, are you able to, like, get that level of nuance just because I wanna make sure that this is, like, actually a dead deal? So notice I'm doing a lot of incentivizing here. And what I mean by that is I'm constantly throwing in little things like, hey. Just so my team doesn't call you again or just so I, like, actually make sure that this one's, like, a complete waste of time, could you, like, really tell me, like, why this thing doesn't work? But then I'm, like, layering in little traps, and I'm like, hey. Like, my my guess is you can probably see if someone's gotten four promotions in the last seven years, and, like, that's something that I know the other competition can't do. I'm, like, laying these traps so that they'll usually give you an answer that's like, it doesn't do all of that, but it it sorta gets the job done for the most part. And that's my opportunity to do step three, which is, like, selling the test drive. K. So here's the thing. It's like, you're, like, right at the finish line. You've you've sort of, like, poke this hole of doubt in the competitor. And a lot of times, this is when, like, sellers will come in with, like, pressure pitch, and they'll be like, well, our product, like, has the ability to, like, do all these advanced filters and show you these types of candidates and these types of candidates, and immediately the prospects, like, sales pitch again, and, like, you lose the deal. Right? And so you never wanna sell the product. You wanna sell the test drive. K? So you don't wanna, like, sell people, here here's this, like, nice shirt that I want you to buy right now. Here's this, like, Tesla that I want you to buy right now. You wanna be like, hey. Like, I know you got a car already. Like, do you wanna give this thing a ride, like, just so you know it's out there? And nine times out of 10, like, people wanna take the test drive. Like, Tesla has sold a ton of cars to people who, like, never thought they were gonna get a Tesla. And then they took the test drive, and they're like, oh, like, that's that's a car. Right? And so you're gonna do that with your product. And so if I was selling the test drive at Covey with Jane, I'm gonna say something like this. I'm gonna be like, Jane, honestly like, I've noticed, like, you're hiring some, like, really awesome engineers, and, like, my guess is you have a pretty refined candidate profile. My guess is you're probably not gonna switch off of your existing tool. But, like, are you open to, like, us running this on one of your roles because we can filter for a lot of that, like, human level nuance that you're talking about? And if nothing else, like, you'll know what's out there and you can see what it looks like. And nine times out of 10, they'll be like, yeah. I'll I'll take a look. And then, like, once they're in the car, then you can be like, so, like, maybe we could talk about financing. Maybe we could buy out your current car. Maybe we can, like, buy out your lease. Like, you can do all that stuff and, quote, unquote, sell the value of your solution when you aren't doing a cold call on a complete stranger. But, like, a common mistake that people will make is, like, they'll try to, like, turn these cold calls into sales pitches. And, like, the phone is a meeting setting device. Like, get them on an actual call where you can, like, sit down. You're not catching them in between meetings. You're not gonna get, like, interrupted by them, like, being like, shoot. I gotta jump to my next one. And then you can actually walk them through a proper sales process. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes.
