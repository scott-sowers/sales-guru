## Transcript

It's really hard to get an entry level sales job today. There are hundreds of SDR candidates nowadays. How does an SDR stand out from the 30 plus candidates they're they're competing against in the interview process? Don't use AI to write your resume. It honestly might be a little bit better than some of the resumes I've seen. I don't know. Listen. I think if you're trying to get a role that involves heavy rejection, heavy, you know, prospecting. Practice what you preach. Right? Prospect into the hiring managers. Try and find any connection that you can, add people on LinkedIn. I think getting creative and trying to stand out and showing that you're a human can break through the noise. Right? Obviously, there's some level of skill, and if you can really think about how you translate the things that you learn in college into functional skills that's that you would be able to express in that role, that, obviously, that's key. But I think that communication of it lands with finding the right people, having conversations, reaching out to sales reps, asking them how they broke into that role, and just getting that perspective, I think, is is pretty critical. Yeah. I would honestly not say anything differently. And I can give you the perfect story of this. I had a rep named Grace Presnick that wanted to work really badly at Outreach. And, I used to drive from my house in Bothell to the HQ Building in Seattle. It took me thirty five minutes, and I would leave at 05:30 in the morning at my from my house and get to the office by six. So a good thirty minute window where I'm capturable. Guess who called around Outreach, found out when the best time to call Mark Costello is, and then called me at 05:45AM to ask for an interview? Grace Presnick. Guess who got an interview? Grace Presnick. Guess who got the job then? Grace Presnick. And so, like, I the reason why it was so simple was she demonstrated the skill of the job to get the job. And I think that's exactly your point. Right? Like, is don't just say you have the skills. If you got them, show them. So next question is from Sean. And this one is, what is the number one unconventional or controversial quality to hire for in a sales rep? You got one? Creativity. It's not easy to pull out, I think, of someone and understand how they creatively think, how they creatively act, whether it be through prospecting, through deal execution, through even post sale success. But I think that the way that I would like to look at it or or try to, qualify for it is what are those processes that they always fall back on when they are being you know, when they are challenged with a heavy workload or they have a heavy a a large funnel that they're trying to, you know, execute across. And that's where they can then shine in their creativity. Right? If you have those kind of core processes that you can always rely on, it it gives you that freedom. And I think a lot of it comes from other aspects of their life. Right? What do they like to do outside of work? Are they creative in the sense of, like, actually creating, you know, videos or do they like to paint? But, also, it could be in from an athletic endeavor or just anything that is inspiring to them outside of their work, I think, makes people multifaceted. And it also, you know, can can relate to their motivation and, like, what intrinsically drives them. Oftentimes, that goes well beyond just money recognition and title. I watch woodworking videos on YouTube. Does that make me creative? I think it does. Yeah. I would say, though, though, one of the things that I identified early on at a couple companies for hiring that really made a difference was the ability to transfer passion. Can I get someone else excited about something that I'm excited about? And I think that if a rep can't get someone excited about a product that they're selling, then they're gonna have to rely on just the justify with reason, not the buy with emotion part. You wanna combine those two together. And the best way to get people into it emotionally is to be able to transfer your passion and excitement about something. Yeah. I remember we would ask people, could you sell me hot cocoa on a hot beach in Florida in summer? And you get a lot of crazy answers, and you'd see if someone would get all in, like, all bent out of shape and super awkward and comfortable, or you'd see these kids who'd, like, light up and be like, okay. First, I gotta find the people who are, like, running on the only track in Florida. Yeah. It's like, okay. The people who are over at the beach, and they're, like, finding ways, like, or I could go to the gym area that's on the beach, and those people would want the fast digesting carbs of, like, the hot cocoa or something like that. Or I would go and I would, like, set up right next to an icy shop or something like that. You get a lot of crazy stuff, and I think sometimes it's just figuring out if someone could be crafty Yeah. In the job. Yeah. And do they like that intellectual exercise, or do they run from it? Because how many sales calls have multiple instances where you gotta just lean into the weirdness. You know? Yeah. I've got a a controversial reverse answer to this question, which is a lot of people, like, hire for hard work in sales, and I think it's probably the most overrated trait. And the reason for that is when you're hiring great people, it's table stakes that you work hard. Is I find that, like, yeah. It's obviously, you want someone who works harder than the average person, which is not very hard. But a lot of times when you hire an SDR or an AE who's just a grinder but can't think, what you get is, I'm gonna make 500 cold calls this week on the wrong accounts. Mhmm. I'm gonna make 500 cold calls this week on the right accounts, but all of the wrong prospects. And the best reps, they realize that it takes some time to think, and you need to measure twice and make sure that you're actually reaching out to good accounts so you know where to spend your time, and then you work really hard. So I'm not saying don't hire people who don't work hard at all, but a lot of times people think that, oh, this person's a college athlete, and they're gonna be a crazy grinder. They're gonna change the world for us. And that can be true, but not if they don't use their brain at all. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox.
