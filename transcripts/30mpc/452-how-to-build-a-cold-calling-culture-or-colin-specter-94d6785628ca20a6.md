## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my host, Mark Cosiglio. And today, if you are trying to get your team to pick up the phone, cold call, motivate them to dial, have some more structure in their day, we have the man who runs the dialing empire. His name is Colin Spector. He is the SVP of revenue over at Orem. If you're not familiar with Orem, they have a parallel dialing solution. And if there is a team that should be cold calling, it is this one. So he is like that it's not what he calls himself. He's not the cold calling emperor, but that's what I'm calling him because that's what this episode definitely teaches you. Mark, why should people listen? Yeah. I think you nailed it is if you wanna know how to cold call, you go to a company that has a culture of cold calling that sells cold calling technology, and you figure out what works. And that's what we're gonna do today. Like, we're gonna immerse ourselves in cold calls. And the three, two, one. Let's dial. Alrighty, Colin. Welcome back to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get you at three. Awesome. Thanks so much for having me on the show. Number one, daily schedule. You must be disciplined with your sales team, specifically your STRs. Right? Those prospectors, those lead generators about what happens throughout the day. From when you have your power hours, that's your focus time to calling net new logos, when you have your follow ups, when folks are taking a lunch and their training, everything in between. STRs especially thrive in a structured environment. If you're in an office, have the poster scheduled on the wall so people can see what they should be doing throughout the day. If you're virtual, you have that added as a calendar event on their actual calendars. And so they know throughout the day what they're supposed to be doing at that specific time. You're gonna get the right discipline, the right structure in place for people to thrive and know what they should be expected of every single day. Awesome. What's number two? Energy is king. Sales is all about energy. I'm a classic sales leader disciple of the classics, Zig Ziglar, who says sales is a transference of feeling. I'm a huge believer that it's emotion, it's energy, it's the energy of your team and the vibes. The vibes that matter most, how you show up on your calls. A tactical ritual that we have at Orem is our our weekly Monday sales meeting. The entire team looks forward to showing up every Monday morning, and they know they're gonna get four key parts of that that sales meeting on Monday. They're gonna get, number one, the mission. Number two, we're talking our pacing on the sales goals and what we are achieving. And then number three, we're shouting out specific individuals on the team that are pacing above and beyond their goals or that exhibited a behavior that we highly appreciate and that we value at Orem. And then number four, we're doing a call review. Whether you do it on a Monday or Wednesday, I like to do it at the start of the week. Right? Coming off the weekend, get people kicked off. Right? So that's our Monday energy boosting. We call it make it happen Monday on the sales team here at Orem. We got our liquid Red Bull. Give me one more hit, Colin. What's number three? Number three, baby. Hiring best ever solves all problems. It just does folks. Sales leaders out there, when you hire best ever talent, it just elevates you so much better because you feel amazing coaching the Kobe Bryans of the world. Right? We all wanna coach the Kobe Bryans of the world. We all wanna be the Phil Jacksons, of course, just to get tactical there. And we have all made mistakes. I've definitely made mistakes. And sometimes the mistake is maybe it's a great rep somewhere else, but not here. But here's the tactical takeaway when it comes to hiring best ever talent. If you're rating folks, we rate them. If you're in a position of saying, yeah, they're good enough, that's a no. It has to be best ever. It's like, wow. This person's best ever. This person is gonna come in and set a new standard here. Your top people are gonna thrive bringing this person in because they're gonna be chasing them on the leaderboard. They are gonna uplift everyone else in this team, and that type of performance is contagious. That type of culture is contagious. One of the things that I found, I think, is, like, one of these fundamental truths of sales is what you said earlier, SDRs thrive in structure. What I really wanna do is kinda go through in a call heavy company that's based on calling technology. How do we get that rhythm and that explicit, this is what we do here every day to be very call for? Because I think a lot of sales leaders are seeing the phone is working, but they can't get their reps on the phone enough to really capitalize on that. Take me through, like, what is the daily structure of an SDR at Orem that's super call heavy? So we're talking about at Orem where a calling culture already exists. The team is showing up. They're having their daily stand up with the SDR leader. We're going through the day's goals, any changes, any updates, and then we're going into the first prospecting block of the day starting at 09:30AM, that last thirty minutes. And then we go into our call blocks for net new accounts only. You have specific blocks on the calendar that are preserved for specific actions, specific activities. So there's a rigorous schedule that the STRs are held to every single day. You go from your daily stand ups to your prospecting block to your call block, and the call blocks you have labeled. So you have a call block focused specifically on net new logos only. And at the start of that call block called a call blitz, everybody gets on the sales floor and you're announcing, all right, guys, it's power hour. Everyone stand up, let's stretch and let's hit the phones. We're getting after it. Often in that, we will run spiffs. We'll gamify it, not every single day, but most days we're running a spiff. The most common spiff that we run is called call wars. Whoever books the most meetings with net new logos only, you win the prize. And so playing games throughout the day, throughout the week is critically important. You gotta have fun. You gotta motivate. This goes beyond the OTE. So you've got your call blocks. You've got your call wars. You're mixing in some games in these moments, and then you have time structure for your follow ups with current opportunities, folks that you're chasing, folks that you caught in the phone, or you did a quick little lightning demo, and you're needing to get them back into the pipeline. So you got your follow ups, and then you got your emails, and then we do lunch, and then we do another call blitz, another call block. Net new logos only. So we're doing two net new logos only, one hour call blitzes each day, usually with a different game or theme in mind. Not every single day, but most days do you have that. And then similar kind of structure in the back end of the day, your follow ups, your prospecting, your emails, and then sales training scheduled at the end of the day there. Do you have, like, in the hour, this is the KPI you need to hit? Like, number of dials, number of people touched. The power hour makes a lot of sense, but, like, how do I know I did the power hour well? Depending on how many people you're speaking with throughout the day, the daily activity KPI that we hold our people accountable to is a 150 calls per SDR per day. And so you might hit a 100 of those in the first power hour, maybe 50 in the second. And that mixture can happen because you're speaking, you're connecting with people at different times of day, etcetera. So 150 calls per day per rep, and those are two unique contacts. And then to get those people into the system, first of all, from a prospecting perspective, we do a one, two, three model. This is specifically for our commercial mid market STRs. One account, two departments, and then three contacts per department. So or business unit, depending on how you label it. So for us, we're targeting revenue leaders. We might call on the enablement side of that account. We might call on the sales leadership side of that account. We might also call on the marketing side of that account. And so we'll pick at least two departments based upon the research we found of where, in our case, we're selling an inside sales or SDR solution. The revenue folks are reporting into, right, are they reporting into marketing, are they reporting into sales? Maybe we'll call it rev ops. So whomever we have decided, we're gonna get at least two departments per account and then three contacts per department before moving on to the account, and that's our prospecting KPI per business. Alright. So a 150 calls a day. I got two hour long call blocks. When I call an account, I'm expected to call two departments and three people inside each one of those departments. I would just love to know, like, as you're looking through KPIs and metrics in this, let's, like, go down the funnel. So the first is a 150 dials. What would you expect as a connect rate right now at a really great power hour? Connect rates, we're talking cold outbound. We hover around five to 6% for cold outbound. Gotcha. So I'm connecting with, say, eight, nine, 10 people a day in my 150 dials. How many of those should I book a meeting with? Like, how many of those are, like, you know, meeting book rates? We look for a 20% connect to meeting booked rates. So you should be booking a meeting with one out of five people that you connect with over the phone. That's good. That's awesome. How good can that get? Like, what's the difference between the top performers and the average performers? Top performers are 30% plus. Wow. So, like, one and three. Yep. As you look through the power hour, I'm sure, like, at the end of the power, it's not just like, alright. Hang up. Let's go. How do you wind this thing up so that people are like, oh, you know, Colin book seven meetings, our mom book zero meetings, Mark book zero meetings. You know? Energy is contagious. Right? You're on the Sales Floor. You're watching the scoreboard, and that's the other thing. You need to have some dashboards in front of your sales leaders. Maybe it's a Salesforce dashboard. If using Orem, you have the Orem dashboard refreshing. And so people are seeing their live calling stats on the sale. So we create a virtual sales floor. We're a remote company. If you're in office, you should have screens up with your dashboard hooked in there, and people can see how they're showing up. And that's the competitive nature that drives people to keep pushing to book that next meeting. At the end of the power hour, we're going through a summary of the results. Okay. Great. Power hour's over. People are wrapping up their calls, and then our SDR leader. I used to personally run these. My SDR leader's running most of these today, but I love getting on the floor. It's contagious, but we're summarizing all the results. We're going through, okay, who won call wars today? Who had the most meetings? Who had the most conversations? Who had the most follow ups? Because the second best thing to a booked meeting is a follow-up. The lowest hanging fruit, the most likely people to book a meeting is a follow-up. It's actually less likely you know, 20% of the time you're gonna book a meeting on the phone, the first connect, most of those meetings actually get booked on the follow ups. And those can get high as, like, 50% plus. It's funny you mentioned this part because my daughter came to me, and she was one of the top SDRs at Outreach after I left. And she's like, dad, the thing that's keeping me from being number one is my meeting book rate. And she was at 5% of the calls that she connected with the right person she was booking a meeting with. And so we went in and listened to some calls, and what we found was she was actually acting like an AE. She was having, like, seven, eight, nine minute cold calls where she was doing discovery, and the people were kind of qualifying out because she didn't have the skills yet to, like, continue that kind of a conversation. So we trained her on your job as an SDR is to sell a meeting, not to sell a deal. Now this is in a probably a little more mature market. The outreach was over $250,000,000 at the time. We got her meeting book rate to be number one on the team. It was 13%. She really learned, like, you gotta look at these conversion metrics. If you're not looking at the conversion metrics, you don't know where to diagnose your problem. And once you know where to diagnose your problem, you can go attack it. Because sometimes, you know, it's like the connect rate, and it's because the data's bad. And that's not on nothing on the rep. That's a rev ops issue that we need to go fix. And so diagnosing that through that conversion funnel is really, really important. I totally agree, Mark. I mean, you you nailed it. It's issue diagnosis. You need the metrics to give you a sense of what standard you set, where people are what's the deviation, where people are falling short on, yeah, on the connect rate, and that's how many people you connected with that were the intended target out of the calls you made. So let's say you're making a 100 calls for simple math. If you have a 5% connect rate, you're connected with five people. Okay? On if we're talking cold outbound, how is that is that expected? Great. That's actually expected in b to b upper mid market enterprise. A 5% connect rate is expected. That's what you're gonna get from the Zoom infos of the world, the most data providers. If you're staying around five or 6% in most industries, that's average and good and expected. Now there are ways to amplify that through AI, and Orm even has some unique features there. Follow-up calls, different story. Customer calls, install based customers Yeah. Different story, and then you could do things with branded caller ID. We're talking about cold b to b mid market or enterprise outbound. We're talking five to 6%. Connect to meeting, that comes down with how relevant your messaging is with the person you're speaking with as well. So is there a good fit with your message, the relevancy of the message? And so upstream from that, to get to a 20%, to get from a 5% to a 20%, we need to diagnose what is missing that we're only getting 5%. Is it the message? Is it the persona I'm targeting in the first place? Is it the timing? Am I calling people that are not in a cycle? Am I off cycle or off season from this industry? So it could be a few different elements there. And so getting to the root of the issue, it's gonna help you. And you might need to run some experiments there and see how can I impact my connected meeting rate and come up with different experiments between you, your reps? Don't try too many things at once. Focus on one thing at a time and look over the week or the past couple weeks and see who has the best connected meeting rate. The number one thing that helped my daughter besides not doing AE level discovery on a cold call was the follow ups thing. And I think that people drastically overlook the follow ups thing. And so we created something called three strikes and you're out. You have three chances to overcome an objection. That's it. Three. After that, you're rude if you keep trying to pummel people. So on the third objection, what she would say is, you know what? You're probably right. This wasn't a good time to do a cold call. But I tell you what, I'm gonna stay in touch via email, and would you mind if I sent you an invite for five minutes and thirty days just to see if anything's changed? About a third of people would say yes, and almost all of them then would pick up. And that's what boosted her meeting book rate is because now she's walking into February with, like, seven or eight booked calls of people that were already warmed up in what was going on, and that continued to build and build and build. And so people sleep on this follow-up thing. That's the honeypot. In the other markets, the honeypot. Right? If if you're a hunter, if you're an outbounder, people wanna build a calling culture. Right? Well, the first pass through that account list, you're warming it up. It takes multiple touches for people to reduce enough uncertainty to wanna invest time with you. Right? Depends how good your marketing air cover is. Are you hitting them with ads at the same time as the cold call? Are you hitting them with email? Are they seeing you on the LinkedIn scroll? Like I'm seeing Mark all day, which I love, by the way. I love the insights. And so I'll take a call from Mark any day when he calls me because I'm like, I see him. I'm re my uncertainty is reduced about Mark. Right? So I wanna learn about operator and everything that's going on there. My my curiosity. And so when you catch me cold in that 5% pickup rate, my willingness, my uncertainty because you think about this. People, when they answer the phone, are in fight or flight mode. They have a fear response, just a natural response. Your goal is to reduce uncertainty as quickly as possible. Now if you've done a good job with air cover and if you're doing follow ups especially, you can reduce that uncertainty. Hey. Yeah. I caught like like you said, your daughter's doing it. Right? She's reducing uncertainty with that thirty day calendar hold. Like, yeah. We spoke last month. You mentioned, you know, you're going to your kid's graduation, and I know your budget cycle was coming up. How's now look at some AI coaching solutions? Right? Mhmm. Going into it. Like, yeah. Oh, great memory. Now you've built rapport. Sales is emotion. You still wanna buy from people you like and trust. It's all about reducing uncertainty. Those things really matter. So, yeah, follow-up is king. Colin, I wanna dig into the other metric. We have connect to meeting. The way you fix that is by targeting the right people on the accounts or fixing your messaging, your talk tracks, your phone skills, etcetera. And I'll just add that targeting is probably the most underrated thing to fix. The perfect talk track on the wrong prospect is still the wrong talk track. Let's assume that both of those things are working, but you actually have a volume issue. So let's assume that your reps aren't hitting their dial count for the day. So they're supposed to be hitting a 150 a day, and you find that your reps are hitting a 100 dials a day or 75 dials a day. I'm curious, like, what are some of the most common reasons that that will happen? And then we can go into Connect. Right? Afterwards. First of all, it comes down to the standard you set. Right? If the standard is a 150, then you gotta hold them to that, and you should have performance conversations if they're not meeting that and understand why. Why aren't they? Is it a skill thing? Is it a will thing? Or do they have some sort of bottleneck in their workflow? And so you can shadow that rep and understand in their workflow where are they getting stuck. But you you need to have a performance conversation with that specific individual. And if it happens too many times, you need to document it. As a sales leader, we have to document everything. Our people want us to push them up to achieve more than they otherwise could on their own. Right? That's the dream as a sales leader is, you know, you've got best ever talent. You're empowering them, and you're coaching them. You're pushing them beyond limits they thought possible in terms of what they can achieve. If there's something missing there from an activity perspective, are they getting to the goal that they have set? Right? There so that that down funnel, the end result being their quota, are they hitting their meeting booked quota in a different way? Are they getting there faster still, or are they missing that and missing the activity? Because if they're hitting their quota but missing the standard on the activity, our curiosity should be firing of, like, what are they doing different to get to quota while not meeting the activity standards? And if they're not pacing the goal and they're not hitting activity, that's performance conversation. If they're hitting their goals and not hitting the activity metrics, let's understand how they're getting there. And is there a better, faster, stronger way that we can all learn from about what good looks like in our organization. So just as more of a philosophical approach to it. But So, Colin, if if I could ask about that, I remember I had one rep who is awesome. Her name is Alyssa, and she would put up $50 a week and book more meetings than anyone else. And it drove me insane because everyone was like, that's all I gotta do. But she was, like, so good at, like, targeting and creative outreach and messaging and LinkedIn videos and all that stuff. And so I was like, I couldn't just be, like, pick up the phone more. But at the same time, I was like, no. You, Timmy, like, you gotta pick up the phone. Like, you're not you're not gonna be able to recreate her magic, or maybe you can over time, but right now, you can't. How do you balance that when you have someone who's not doing the minimum activity standpoints, but they're finding success? How do you allow for that creativity without dropping your bar for the inputs that you expect your team to do? You've gotta earn the right for that. Right? So when you first come into the organization, you gotta follow the playbook, the expectations that are set. And by the way, as a leader, you need to have very clear expectations of of what is expected of them. How quickly are they expected to ramp and get on the phones? Are they expected to get on the phones within two weeks and book their first meeting? That needs to be very clear. Or if it's within thirty days, that needs to be very clear. I think where leaders go wrong is maybe they get loose on this and folks, you know, could kinda hang around and, you know, they wait a quarter, they go on pip. I think upfront, the expectation needs to be set, and the playbook needs to be understood and followed. And And then once as let's say as a rep, if the rep is following the playbook, hitting goal, and then some, they're doing some creative outreach and then some, absolutely, we wanna learn about the and then some. So, you know, an example would be, you know, I've had reps come in whom are doing some creative stuff on LinkedIn, but they're not doing the activity metrics on the calls. They're also not hitting their booked meeting rate. So we have a problem then. Right? Because they think they are doing the right things by, you know, doing social touches and videos on LinkedIn. But if they're not hitting their meeting rate and they're not doing what the playbook calls for day in and day out from an activity perspective, we have a performance conversation. If they're hitting their booked meeting rate and they're doing well in in the business, it's an interesting balance there because the expectation is that you're making calls if it's a calling shop, but then you could start to play to their strengths a bit if it's a smarter, better, faster way. From my perspective, the rule of thumb in my experience is if they're hitting goal, I'm very happy with that. They all have to come in and start a baseline with what the playbook calls for, and they shouldn't modify that playbook until they've really earned the right to improve in themselves, and they're finding a better, faster, creative way. My top rep, Morgan Mello, she had double the win rate from the average of the team and, like, 30% higher average deal size. And so for that reason, she actually didn't need quite as many opportunities as the next rep. And then other people would try to get by, like, lean on pipe. And I'm like, no. No. No. You haven't earned that yet. Like, you're not closing at that rate. And if you can find that once you get your volume up, that you can get that efficient, it's like, awesome. Let's find other ways to, like, break the playbook, and then you can tone it down. But the problem is when people try to use expert tricks when they haven't mastered the beginner's fundamentals. So you gotta, like, get them to, like, do the basics every single time. It's like, Mark, you always say, you gotta know the rules before you break the rules or something like that. Yeah. It's like that's absolutely true too. I've got one other question for you Sure. Which is when it comes to motivating sales teams, you're actually the first team that I've heard where both call blocks are full team call blocks, it sounds like. Is it true that everyone is dialing together for both of those call blocks and that is mandatory? Because I imagine there are a lot of teams being like, oh, some of my SDRs like to dial, you know, in the bathroom, and then at eleven versus ten, and then some of them like to go in a phone booth with their sort of alone. And, like, I've seen all versions of that. And so I'm curious, like, your rationale behind that and, yeah, unpack it a little bit. I have a small team. My SDR team, I have, seven SDRs right now. So it's not not a huge team. So it's very easy to get everybody in the room together and calling at these times. I think for your team, absolutely. If everybody's in the same office, a 100%. You should have a poster on the wall with the schedule of when we're all calling together. I can't speak for every business, but if you're regionalized, you have reps working East Coast versus West Coast. Right? There may be some nuances there, but the West Coast team all needs to be religious about their call blocks. The East Coast team all needs to be religious about their call blocks. And when the teams overlap, get them all calling together, and that energy is firing and contagious. So for our team of of seven that we have today at Orem, yes. Very easy for us in the two hours per day that everyone is on the Sales Floor. In our case, the Virtual Sales Floor on Orem, making our calls together and hitting our our goals. So that's, yeah, that's the expectation. Yeah. One of the first things that we did at Carta when I turned around the SDR team is they were like a no dial team. So they were just, like, blasting emails because there was so much white space, and they had doubled the size of the SDR team. And, eventually, the TAM got pretty tight. And so we knew we were gonna have to start calling down accounts, but no one wanted to make phone calls. And so I knew on the team of, call it, 18 reps at the time, if I could flip three and get them all to dial at the same time on the floor, other people would do it too. And it's one of those things where, like, I know you want the flexibility. I know people wanna dial on their own, but there's just something magic about, like, the buzz of the sales floor when you hear every single person cold calling at the exact same time. You laugh off the rejections altogether. And I remember when things flipped was we had this new rep who's just starting, and she saw some of the new reps that I had flipped doing dials, and so she joined the DialBlitz. And then everyone was listening in because she was, like, pretty good. And she ended up, like, sticking with this prospect for three minutes, and you could tell it was, like, she was, like, on the fifty fifty. And she had, like, asked for the meeting, and everyone just went silent. And then she smiled, and she booked the meeting. The moment she hung up, the entire floor stood up and plotted. Yeah. And that stuff doesn't happen if you're dialing in silence and you're dialing alone. Even if one person prefers that privacy of dialing, the greater good of the team is far, far more worth it if you could even do, like, one or two doublets as as a team per week. 100%. And there have been some psychological studies on this, like working shoulder to shoulder even on a sales floor. And I and if you're virtual, you you gotta admit, you know, emulate it as best you can, but there is something about people working shoulder to shoulder. You know, in our software sales world, that's us in the sales pit, you know, if we can get in an office, that psychologically motivates you and drives you. It is a team level effort. Yeah. You nailed it. For those in the audience that are looking to turn around or create a a calling culture, Armand, you nailed a very tactical example. Getting a couple reps bought in, they're the spark, and they get the rest of the team to catch fire. Like, when we come in, we do call transformations in businesses. We take them from email only shops to calling shops. That's one of the first things we do is we find a couple believers. Maybe they had called at a prior company. So So you wanna figure out where on the operational readiness scale that business is, that leader is, or, you know, their data, their team, their script, their messaging. Let's say you've got some basic messaging. You've got you know, as everybody's got is an info database. Most people just have it mapped the data in right. You get that mapped in right. You get a good message. You get a couple people bought in. They're the spark. When they start catching fire, the rest of the team is gonna take notice. Like, woah. What what's that gal drinking? What what what's that guy doing? So attitudes are contagious, especially on the sales floor. So yeah. No. Big fan. Dude, amazing show again. We have to move to the final question, and we talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit. But what is one bad habit, perhaps related to dialing or getting their team to pick up the phone, that every sales leader should break so that all teams get a little bit better? Not setting a standard of what you expect reps to do when it comes to the phone and letting reps just wing it. Right? So there's a spectrum of structured, scripted power hours locked in every single day in the spectrum of artisanal selling, as it's called, where we're we're just kinda letting reps figure it out and play to their own strengths. As a leader, you've got to set the standard and what you expect, how you show up every day. Reps look to you as the example. They're gonna look to your your people and whatever the kinda lowest performing behavior that they see, they're gonna assume is is accepted. Right? And others can catch wind of that. So it goes into, like, the theme of energy and attitudes and expectations. And if the expectations is this is a high performing team, and here on this sales development team, you're expected to come in and make a 150 calls per day. You're in the power hours focused on new new accounts every single day in those two hours. And the rest of that time, you have for follow ups. You have for list building. You have for sales training. You have for lunch and breaks and all of that. But in these two holy hours, this is what we're doing. That level of expectation, it grounds people every single day. There's another zigzilarism. Motivation is like bathing. It's recommended daily. And so you have to find that that that that structure every single day to get people what they're expected of, their energy state, and get them on the phones every single day. Don't let them wing it. They're gonna thrash and pip out, and and then you're gonna get a bad rep you score when that happens. Thank you for bringing the motivation on how to run a sales team, how to get your team down. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Mark. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Colin Spector. What do you have for your two? Yeah. Number one is I love this idea of posting the schedule on the wall, this, like, physical thing that says this is how we do things. I just thought that that was really smart and, like, set the tone of if we care enough to put it on the wall, probably is something that we do. And then, number two is knowing your cold call funnel. So what Colin talked about is a 150 dials a day that converted a five to 6% connection rate, meaning you get the right person five to 6% of the time, and then 20% of those correct connects turn into meetings. I think that that's not overly complicated. It's three stops along the funnel, and I think that that allows you to really diagnose what someone's problem is so that you can help them out with better cold calling. Number three, two dial blocks per day, one at 10AM, one at 1PM, and do them altogether as a team. There is just something about the energy about the sales floor when you see everyone else dialing altogether that gets your team cold calling more consistently competing with each other, etcetera. And then lastly, number four, if you're trying to get your team to dial, it is critical that you flip, like, one or two. Find two people who believe in the phones and rally around them and help them find early success, and stay as close as you can to those folks until they succeed, and then other people will turn as well. Folks, if you like this one, we actually put together a full guide that you can share with your reps on how to act like an actual human being on a call. It is a step by step guide on having your reps not talk like robots, talk a little bit more like humans. It uses a lot of talk tracks from our book, Cold Calling Sucks, and that's why it works. So go check that out in the show notes. And, everyone, hang on for the next one. See you next week.
