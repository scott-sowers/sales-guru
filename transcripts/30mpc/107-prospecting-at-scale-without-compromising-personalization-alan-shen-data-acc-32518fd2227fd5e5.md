## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Froak. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Segielski. And, unfortunately, this guest sales manager is terrible. We have a man named Alan Shen. He works for a company called Pave, and the sales leader at Pave's name is Armand. Nick, why would people listen to this episode knowing how poorly coached this man has been? Well, you know, I don't even know what to say to that. So despite Alan's sales leaders deep, deep shortcomings, Alan has turned out to be a pretty great salesperson. And it's not only because of the way that he prospects or the way that he cold calls customers. It's actually in the way that he is extremely intentional with his time and his process. And so if you're a salesperson that feels like sometimes you're spinning your wheels or you're exhausting yourself doing research and personalizing emails, Alan has some stuff that, like, I I feel like if you implement some of the things that he does, you could see a 30% pump in your productivity with a significant decrease in the amount of cognitive energy that you spend on your research and work. Alrighty, folks. He's looking lean. His emails are mean. Three, two, one. It's mister Aladdin. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Alan. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Yeah. Awesome. Thanks for having me. So the the first one is use the eighty twenty rule to focus on the right accounts. Certain accounts in your book have better ROI than others. For example, a closed loss account, which is an account you've engaged in a previous sales cycle with, it's more likely that to get them to reengage in with you in conversation compared to a net new account, a completely new account that's never you've never heard of before or they've never heard of you before. So what to do here is bucket the different types of accounts and prioritize them based on ROI. For example, tier one, closed loss. Tier two, previous meeting, you've met with them in the past. Tier three, they've had given you a warm response, through email or phone and work through them based on that priority. Beautiful. What's number two, Alan? Yeah. Number two is, stay organized and never let opportunities slip through the cracks. I think, as an SDR, your job can get real noisy, real messy. And so when it comes to your inbox, for example, that's potential opportunities awaiting your response. In order to really tackle that, have the zero inbox rule so nothing got slipped through the cracks. A prospect asks you to reach out in three months. Create an automate animated reminder to reach back out in two and a half months. So that way, you don't have to physically remember to do so. And lastly, you learn something interesting about your account, through a cold call or through a email response. Even though it might not be useful now, like, write it down your Salesforce account for for future reference. So that way, either you or your teammate, whoever's gonna approach this account later on in the future, you have some content there to work with. Very nice. Round us out with number three, Alan. Yeah. Build feedback loops to refine your techniques. I think oftentimes, it can get difficult to find consistent improvement in the SDR job. It can seem monotonous. But, really, the best way I found to continuously improve is set up recurring times to their colleagues, your mentors, your managers to show shorten the feedback loop and consistently improve. Rather than getting feedback once every quarter, what if you got feedback once every two weeks? Exchange the tips that have worked well, your cold call openers, ways to approach your books, subject lines that have high open rates, any tactical advice, that could be helpful to you and your teammates. Alrighty, Alan. So you know you need to work five accounts per day, twenty, twenty five accounts per week, for example. So let's say that you wanna go about finding five accounts to work today. How do you do it? Yeah. The best way to do it is sort of similar to what I mentioned earlier, is finding out accounts that say, hey. Have, the highest percentage ROI in terms of their response rates. So the ones that worked well the best for me are any accounts I've had previous history with us, essentially. And breaking that down into three buckets. First is closed lost, which is you've had long term conversations, multiple calls. Second, previous meeting, you've met with them once or twice in the past. And third is anytime somebody has responded to you by email or phone. I would categorize it that way. Look through Salesforce, create a report to find folks that fit those categories and work through them, in that order. So, Alan, we've found five accounts, whether they're closed loss, previous warm responses, previous meetings, whatever. But we have five accounts in our hands, and now we actually wanna start tearing apart each of those accounts. How do we go about doing that? What are we looking for? The first thing to look for is really just disqualifying any accounts that you don't wanna waste any of your time on. Right? There's plenty of accounts you see that is HQ'd in San Francisco, but half their employees are international, which may not fit your ICP, may not be the type of account that your company and your team wants to go after. Get rid of those accounts upfront. Get rid of everything that that may not be extremely relevant or even remotely relevant to what you're trying to do. Again, spend the time on the 20% of accounts that are gonna yield 80% of the results in your in your final book. Alan, one of the things that I have learned from Armand over the years is when you're looking at an account and determining, should I be contacting this organization or not? There's often he calls them buying triggers. I think of them as triggers for a reason to reach out. And one of the things that I understand is that you're extremely systematic about your prospecting. Let's say you're looking at Greenfield territory. You've got a list of 500 prospective accounts that you could be reaching out to, and you want to get through them as efficiently as possible. Can you talk to me about, like, what would your process be to be able to rip through all of those so that you can start finding context and sequencing and either getting in or getting out with that account? Yeah. So the first thing to do is not to do all 500 at once. I think I fell into that trap previously where I'm trying to tier and research all my accounts, the entire you know, all in one go, and I I think that definitely is not the way to do it. You just not have enough time to actually do the outreach you need. So, typically, the way I would like to do it is I'm splitting up 25 accounts to 50 accounts every single week. And the things I'm looking for are specific triggers that I've I've found that I've worked previously in the past when it comes to responses. So, customizations on things like, how fast are they growing? Are they hiring a lot of people? Are they the only HR contact in this entire team? So looking at at a team context. All these different types of buying triggers, I'm making a note of it while I'm doing my prospecting. So that way, the customization that I've I've discovered, these certain variables that I'm looking for will go into my emails automatically after during the, the sequencing process. And then extremely tactical question here, but you're finding these nuggets when you're looking at these when you're doing your account research. Where are you actually putting the the nuggets that you find so that they don't just get lost in cyberspace? Yep. Great question. So the setup is on my left hand side is a spreadsheet that includes the name of the accounts, and the specific variables are all individual, rows that are in the spreadsheet itself. So the way that it works on the right hand side would be your LinkedIn, Crunchbase, your Gong, your Salesforce, anything where you're will you will be extracting information from. So every time I find a nugget of information from a specific tab, say, on LinkedIn, I transfer that piece of information to the left hand side on the spreadsheet. And my goal is to never have to reopen any of the tabs on the right ever again. It's get everything I need on the left, and by the time I finish, researching, I have my outreach on the right hand side and still the same spreadsheet on the left hand side. I just transfer over the information. It's almost copy and paste. Not that much I thought you know, a lot of the prework has already been done just putting it over to into the email itself. So you've got this spreadsheet with all of these different columns of information you're looking for to inform your prospecting outreach. And I know this is gonna be specific to Pave, but for the benefit of the audience to understand, like, the things that you are looking for, can you give me a sense of what's on that spreadsheet, and why is that important for your outreach? Yeah. Totally. So I think just to provide a bit more context about, what our what our company does and and what things I'm looking for specifically, we're in the HR tech space. So what we're really trying to do here is to figure out a way to automate folks' compensation philosophy. So we're targeting HR personas, people who are in spreadsheets trying to run merit cycles or trying to communicate and work with work with folks on their team to help them understand their total rewards as an example. So things that matter to me are, for example, the growth rate. The growth rate matters because if the company is growing very fast, chances are the spreadsheets that they have to do when it comes to merit cycle season is gonna get real tough. Or another thing that you can think about or or translate is if they're growing really fast, that typically means that the company is doing quite well, and you wanna translate and help that help employees understand the upside of the business. And and that is all sort of things that relate back to exactly what we do and a specific variable that I would be looking after. Another example would be your VCs. You know, we work with Andreessen portfolio companies using that as a reference. And we do have a bunch of Andreessen portfolio companies in our database. So referencing that thing specifically and saying almost using FOMO as a way to get folks who wanna talk to us has been a really great way to to to get them to engage to our emails. And, Alan, when you're doing your research, one thing that I've noticed about you is you keep it really tight. You're not looking for every single thing in the world. You're really looking for the same three things over and over and over again. Right? Is is there ever a world in which you're spending, like, more than five minutes researching a counter pulling in other stuff, or is it pretty much the same thing every time? In the beginning, I definitely spent a lot more time finding and looking really deeply into an account to find maybe 10 different things for me to inform my decision. And, the reason why we would do that in the beginning, I think, is to train our muscle of figuring out, prioritization. Right? We tier all our accounts that we work through, a tier, b tier, c tier, with a tier being accounts that you wanna spend the most time on. In the beginning, I think you do wanna look through all the different variables to inform a decision there just because you're not that muscle hasn't been worked yet. You've been doing this for a few months now, you can really typically look at an account and be able to almost immediately say, hey, this is an A tier. I wanna spend a lot of time here or not. This is a C tier. I probably won't need to spend too much time here based on specific indicators. And once you get to that level, I think you only really need to pick out the few points of customization you'll need for your email specifically, and not everything else in the rest of that process. Well, where I've seen this done really well is in your early days of email writing and tailoring, you should be looking at everything because there's so much information out there. And what you should start to do is make a note of what are the common sources of information that you're putting when you're personalizing and customizing your email, and you'll start to recognize patterns and trends. And then what you do is you take the top five to six patterns or trends of sources of information. And like you said in the beginning, you eighty twenty it. And, yes, you could spend an extra twenty six minutes going deep into an account research, but unless you're in, like, extreme enterprise sales where you have four accounts in your book of business, it's probably not worth your time to do that much more research because, like, twenty six minutes you spend researching Arman's account is like, you could spend sequencing 12 other accounts with the eighty twenty stuff that you're doing. I think to your point about, choosing those variables and and identifying the trends to them, another great way to sort of build further on top of that is is AB testing the different variables. Right? I think in the beginning, for for example, the way that we test our subject lines, it used to just be account name slash compensation planning. And, one of the things that Arman taught us was, hey. How about let's work through VCs. Let's think about that. Let's use that relationship there to see if we'll get people people to open up our emails. And so what I started doing was AB testing subject line with their name of the VC slash, merit cycle or compensation planning. And the open rates on that were significantly higher than the open rates on just account name slash compensation planning. And so I think that was also in another way where, one, we first notice the trends of things that may work, and second is validating that idea, using data. So, Alan, one thing that I've observed with you is you're looking for one of three triggers pretty much every single time. And one of the things I know you're good at is not rewriting the same email over and over, for example, if a company is growing. So can you walk us through, like hey. You notice three, four, five, ten companies are all having employee growth. How do I start to personalize that scale and make sure I don't reinvent the wheel every single time I find that trigger? So I think it all comes down to the wording of the email specifically, where things are ambiguous enough to know that, you know, that it fits in every single time you use that use that variable, for example. But at the same time, it looks personalized that you spent time, you know, creating that email itself. So, for example, one thing I would say is, you know, during one of my emails that I reach out when it comes to people ops, personas is, you know, hey, first name. We've heard from other HR folks in the VC portfolio that the upcoming Maracycle is typically a massive headache. So a sentence like that, you can throw in any VC, and it'll still make sense. Right? Later on, a part of the email is, hey. And given that your account name has x percent growth last year, I can only imagine all the comp and cap table reports you'll be forced to pull into 47 different spreadsheets on your next merit cycle. Again, any number you throw into that x will work no matter what number that is. So, creating generalized enough messaging where it still feels customized is sort of the way to go about it. And then my question here is okay. So this sounds like it's probably a very early email in the process. What is your process for okay. They don't respond to that email, and then you call them a couple days later, and you get deeper and deeper in the sequence. Do you continue to weave in the variables that you found in your research, or do you then defer just to auto emails that are more generalized and don't have specific information there? What does that almost decay curve of personalization look like for you? I think typically the decay curve does seem to kick in later on in the sequence, but, there are still instances where I still wanna use the personalization to my advantage. So, for example, it would be cold calling. Right? When I'm cold calling someone, I have my outreach first emails open. So if in the case that they pick up the call and I am giving them and I've gone to the pitch. Right? Cold call opener, all sorted. Can I borrow twenty seven seconds? All good to go. I'm weaving in different points of customization. I'm saying, hey. Look. You know, I we work with a ton of folks from, the Sequoia portfolio, and so typically what I've heard, etcetera etcetera, later on, again, during the part of the pitch. I saw that you guys are growing 30 last year. Congrats on that, by the way. I could really typically only imagine that you'll run into a ton of Maricycle planning problems with all your spreadsheets. So I think it still gets weaved in at certain aspects, less so from the emails itself, but still it's still usable, I think, later down the track when you're calling them. And then if you get to the end of an a sequence on an account, right, you've sent a bunch of emails, you made a bunch of calls to maybe three or four different people there, and you feel like you've exhausted that account, but it's still part of your patch. Are you saying, alright. I'm abandoning these folks. I'm not gonna go after them ever again. Are you setting a reminder for three months, six months later down the line to reengage that account? What's your process look like for, okay. They didn't bite at all this time? So the way that I had all my accounts, prospecting set up was mostly through Salesforce reporting. So, for example, there would be one report that's for all closed loss, one report for all previous meeting, etcetera, etcetera. Within these reports themselves, there's also a filter for time. So when it says days not days since last touched over thirty days, for example. So say I'm working an account, I've exhausted every angle that I can. I honestly just let it sit because I know for a fact that in a month, it is gonna reappear into one of my reports. So that way, it's just gonna sit and fall into my lap. I just look through that report again. I haven't touched it in thirty five days. It's time for me to hit it up again. The way that I like to to sort of, work through them is I have a a set number of reports, say five or six, and every single month, week one, I'm working through the first report. Week two, I'm working through the next. Week three, I'm working through the next report. If in the case, say week one, there's not enough content there, then I I I slip into week two's report, and I try to grab some to work for this week. And typically, I have enough set up there, that I will have enough to kind of, to roll through so that consistently every single week, there's enough accounts for me to work in. At the end of the month, since, the way that our team works, we have a timeline of about thirty eight days before we can hit up an account again. That's sort of the time frame that I have set up for each of these reports. So this this one is key. So to break it down for everyone in the audience, one thing that a lot of teams do is they have their SDRs trolling the activity logs. And if you've been in business for a long time, sometimes an SDR will have to scroll for one account through six years of cold emails. Every 30 days, someone like Alan is reaching out to these people, and you're just scrolling for everyone. And everyone knows Salesforce doesn't load. Sorry. And so what Alan is doing is he's pulling a report that says show me any activities on an account where the comment on the activity says brackets in, which is just the code for an email came in instead of an email went out. And now you can literally just look at every reply that you have ever gotten from a customer and skim the cream off the top instead of spending hours trolling Salesforce activity from the beginning to end. Another example of how you can utilize this little trick, is doing Gong. Right? So Gong is a great place to look up closed lost or previous history because you can watch all the previous, you know, calls and activities that have happened on an account. But a little trick that I noticed is if you're in the search bar and you type in the name of an account and there's a little building icon next to the name, that means there's history there, and you should click in and go watch. But if there's no little building icon, that means there's no history there at all. You should just skip over it. So there's little little things like that you can look out for that will help your prospecting or research process just go by a lot faster. So when you pick up an account, you are typing the name of the account into Gong. And if there's a building next to it, that means there is a recorded call. And if not, that means you've never met with them. So obviously, the ones that have buildings next to them, they're they're your top tier accounts. Is that correct? Yes. Correct. Alan, one of the things you put in the prep doc was you talk about squeezing the juice out of all of your available resources. And I can tell you got Armand excited because I don't think he knew the building Gong thing. What other ways are you squeezing the juice out of all of the available resources you have to you? I know you've got some, I guess, unconventional tricks. Yeah. I think there's just a lot of resources out there for people to to fully utilize that can, one, either, you know, help them find more accounts or save some time that it's embedded as part of the free tools that the company gives you, but we don't really dig into it. I think Salesforce porting is a very big example there where it's kinda scary to to figure out how to use this tool. But once you have that, that can be part of your system. So you you can consistently work through your book with with with less issues. Right? Hunter.io, for example. We we use a bunch of different softwares to try to find emails, but oftentimes, they're not gonna give you the right email. So why don't we sign up for hunter.io, which is a completely free software to to validate at least any every single email that comes in if you think it's a little bit off. Even more interesting tricks, I think, like LinkedIn. Right? LinkedIn is is a tool that we probably all use for our prospecting, but, oftentimes, what will happen is, they won't a prospect won't put their last full last name, on their LinkedIn page. So, for example, it would be Alan S. And one trick that I found out there was, if you really notice in the URL section, sometimes they will put their full sort of username there. And oftentimes, that includes their last name. So if the email that you need to reach out to is first dot last, there you go. You just found their last name to sort of to sort of utilize there. ZoomInfo has intense scoring. Right? So for some magical reason, they have a really interesting way you can find out whether or not someone's been looking into you, and using that again as signal to figure out whether or not, this account is, one, interested in you, two, if they exist if they don't exist in your Salesforce account, grab that and just work it. I love it. So, Alan, you've got all of these different things going on. You're researching accounts. You're tiering them in the spreadsheet. You're plugging emails into hunter.io. You're writing snippets. You're personalizing at scale. You're making cold calls. There are so many things going on in your day. Could you give me a sense of how do you structure your day every single day as an SDR? Staying consistent, that was a big part of what's I think what sort of helped me, just achieve better results. And so the way that would look like is, I will split it down into in in in the whole week format is Monday and Wednesdays would be the research and tiering days. Tuesdays and Thursdays will be the days I'm sequencing, and Wednesday slash Friday would be the days that I'm actually sending things out. And so, consistently, if I'm doing 50 accounts a week, on Monday, I'm doing 25 accounts at in the afternoons, I'm researching. I'm tiering. I'm getting buddy everybody's right emails and and getting ready for them to to ship into outreach. Tuesday mornings, I'm putting them into outreach and trying to get them through all as fast as possible. If I get through all 25, I'm starting to send them out in the afternoon. If I don't get through them on Wednesdays, I'm starting to send them all out. And Wednesday afternoon, I repeat the same process, rinse and repeat, 25 accounts in the afternoon, and get everything out by the next week. Are there days that you are not doing any outbound activity and you're only focused on adding accounts slash researching? Yeah. Great question. No. So the big part of that I didn't mention would would be the outbounding. So, for example, in the mornings, I like to maintain that as as cold calls. Right? That's another thing that I think Arman and the team taught me really well was be consistent. If you're doing 200 dials a week, do 40 a day. So there's a similar block on my in my mornings where it's, like, ten to eleven typically or nine to eleven where I'm just cold calling. And every time I have meetings or anything else, it it gets slotted between those big time blocks. And in afternoons, I always want to maintain and keep that research engineering block there as well. And it's become a really good habit because I think and sometimes when look. We all fall behind sometimes. Right? And it's a Tuesday or Wednesday, and I'm like, oh, I I I mentally know now. I should have had already 30 accounts sequence ready to go, but I've only have 15. So I need to set up and and and get to that number. So that way, I know I'm hitting my weekly goal. And that mini goal aspect of it has been really helpful. So so, Alan, just to play this back how you're planning your week. Each day, you're doing a little bit of outbound. Right? So a little bit of cold calling every single day, oftentimes in the morning. But every day, you are taking sort of the the the non golden tasks of account research, sequencing, what have you, and you're breaking those into different activities across different days. So on your first day, it might be finding 25 accounts. On Tuesday, it's researching 25 accounts. On Wednesday, it's sequencing 25 accounts, and then you lather, rinse, repeat. Is there a reason that you're doing that instead of doing five every single day all the way through? I've toyed around with different sort of mechanisms here before where before I would do 40 accounts, to 50 accounts all upfront, all the research, and start sequencing halfway through the week, get the accounts ready for the week afterwards. But to be honest, I I just get bored too easily with doing all the research upfront, and I wanted to figure out a way that would, you know, stimulate myself and encourage myself to be able to to get through the work in a very consistent basis. And I found that the half half, sort of numbers, that that worked well for me. But, look, I I know other people that like to do five, ten, 10 a day and and sort of rinse and repeat the process, others who like to do everything in one go. I personally have just found it more palatable for myself to do it half or else it just gets, I get really into weeds. Alan, this has been a phenomenal one. We gotta move to our final question, which is we've talked about a bunch of great things salespeople should be doing. We're gonna flip that on its head and ask about the inverse. So the last question is this. What is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? I think taking things too personally. I think at the end of the day, a lot of this SDR job or a sales job, it's not about you. Right? Like, the timing is not right for them. It's not because they hate you. It's not because, you know, you know, you're not doing a good job. Sometimes it's just it is what it is. And I think, managing your psychology when it comes to to the sales job will will help a lot. It's definitely something I'm still learning to do. It's not the easiest thing, but just get out of your own heads, man. It's it's it's not your fault and just move on to the next thing because you know that the volume is is is really what that matters. Put your outbound work in. Get your dials in. Hit up your accounts. You're gonna get more opportunities where you're not gonna screw things up. And the faster you get out of your own way, the the faster you are gonna hit quota and just do better. Very nice. Alan, thanks so much for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap from Arman and myself coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Alan Chen include, number one, when you're planning your week, plan your week in a way where you can time block certain activities that are non golden hour activities. For example, on Monday, you may research 25 accounts. On Tuesday, you may pull the contacts on those 25 accounts. And on Wednesday, you may sequence those 25 accounts and then repeat on Thursday. Number two, when you're pulling those accounts, run a Salesforce report that tracks for anything that is an account that has an in email on that account. Number three, once you have that list of accounts, research the same three or four triggers on the account every single time. And then lastly, number four, build snippets that scale through each of those triggers. For example, you might have a snippet that says noticed you grew x x percent, and then all you do is you just change the percent for each company. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here?
