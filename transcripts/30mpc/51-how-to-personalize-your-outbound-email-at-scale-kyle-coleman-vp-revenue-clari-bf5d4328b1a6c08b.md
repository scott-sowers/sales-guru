## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Frogg. I'm here with my co host Nick Sigalski. And for a round two, round one was the best cold email and clinic I've ever seen. And then round two is another best cold email and clinic I've ever seen with the one and only Kyle Coleman, VP of revenue growth and enablement at Clari. Nick, why should people listen? If you ever send cold emails to customers, I would listen to this episode. Three, two, one. Send your emails. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Kyle. Welcome back to the show. You know, we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Number one, write a lot. People don't write enough. They don't practice writing. And so what I think a a really effective exercise is is to go to your company's website, look at the about us page, and transform what you see there into an outbound email. Don't copy and paste. Don't highlight the text and drop it into your email. Rewrite it and practice this over and over and over again. Look at advertisements that you like the structure of, and try and match that cadence, that tone, that style, the feeling of that advertisement copy in your email writing, and then test it. Write a lot, test everything, analyze it, and continually write. If you do that, you'll find success. Beautiful. What's number two, Kyle? Number two, be ruthless with your time. Be really, really intentional about how you're spending, not every minute of every day, because that can be a little bit overwhelming, but certainly in half hour blocks or hour blocks. Start the day knowing what you need to get done and be really intentional about structuring your day in order to get those things done. If you can do that, that is the key to productivity. If you enter the day without a plan, if you're not ruthless about your time, if you say yes to everything that comes your way, you're not gonna get the important things done. So be ruthless with your time. Love it. What's number three, Kyle? Round us out. Number three, reflect regularly. Every day is cool for some people. Every week is my preferred cadence. And so what I do is every Monday, I write down the top three things that if I get to Friday and I have accomplished those three things, it'll be a good week. And I reflect on it. What went well? What didn't? Did I get all three things done? If not, why not? If so, yes. What else was I able to take on as a result? What was the impact here? What should I change going into next week? And if you're in especially if you're in sales, you always have to be really critical of what's working and what isn't. And, again, if you're not intentional about setting time aside to reflect on what's working and what isn't, you're not gonna improve. So reflect regularly, find the cadence that works for you, and watch the improvement happen. There we go. And, Kyle, in our last episode, we hit on everything cold emails. And, honestly, we're gonna hit on it again because more recently, you've been responding to every single cold email that's coming your way. And so to start at the high level, are there some common themes that you've been able to abstract of things that have and have not gone well in some of the cold emails that you've seen? Oh, Arman. Yes. There are many things that I've noticed that, are not going super well. And I would say if I had to put a number on it, about 90% of the cold emails that I get are hot garbage. They are just not good. And the main reason for it relates to my point number one and my three things here is that it seems like most people just rely on their marketing team or on their management team to write the emails for them. And the market marketing team by definition are very good at writing marketing emails and marketing copy and emails and copy that are useful for people that are seeking your your or your company out. So if somebody comes to my company's website, they are looking for information about my company. But when I'm reaching out cold to somebody, they don't give a a hoot about my company because I haven't shown them that it matters, that they should care. So that's that's the biggest mistake that I see is that most people are not lazy necessarily, but they don't think about how big a difference it is between what an inbound lead wants and what an outbound lead expects. And so they'll take the copy that exists on clari.com/ about us, and they'll copy that into their outbound email. And they say, alright. My work here is done. And they think that that's a good email, but it isn't. And we can unpack the reasons why. But, man, that one thing is a huge, huge deal. I'm a huge stickler for marketing speak. In other words, things that sound like newspaper articles where emails start with lawyers hate working on expenses, and it's just like a statement to the world. So how do I translate the problems that you get in marketing speak to something that sounds like a human at scale? Yes. It does need to sound like something a human would actually say. And the litmus test for this, I think, that I've heard, which is really useful is if you're having coffee with somebody at a trade show, how are you explaining it to them? You're probably not gonna say that they're gonna get a three sixty degree view of their customer. You're probably gonna say something like, they understand everything that their customers are doing. And that is a human way to translate the marketing jargon that works when somebody is seeking you out or works to be punchy or differentiated from a marketing standpoint. It actually makes it work in a human conversation. So be really mindful about translating that marketing jargon to human speak. Now your point about how to do this, how to do the intro lines, or how how to write the emails in a way that doesn't come across as a marketing line that you would see in an email or or on their website. And the way that I, think is really useful to do this, especially in an email, is to start your opening line with some semblance of personalization. And personalization does not necessarily mean, hey, Nick, I know you went to USC. How about them Trojans? Like, yeah, it's cool if you can weave in the literal personal things about that that person's background or interests or hobbies or whatever, but you don't have to do that for every company. Instead, if I said, hey, Nick. Saw that you just hired 20 new salespeople. How are you thinking about onboarding all of them? Or how are you gonna make sure they're all as productive as possible as quickly as possible? How How are you gonna accelerate the ramp time? How are you gonna ensure that they're hitting their revenue targets as quickly as possible? And so those types of firmographic personalizations are just as effective, and they're all readily available for anybody that has LinkedIn premium. You can just go to the insights page, or the insights tab on somebody's on a company's about us page, and you can see all the hiring trends, people they brought on, all those sorts of things. So start with that kind of insight about the person, if possible, about the company if if you want to. And that's how you'll start to open people's eyes and say, okay. This email is written to me. And so now I'm gonna care more about the pain points that the person identifies or the solution that they identify because I know they've written this email for me. So, Kyle, can you take us from the very top of the email? Right? Subject line, first line, body. You've got call to action. I know you have opinions on each. So can you talk about let's start with the subject line. What are the best practices there? What should people be doing? The subject line should be no more than four words. The sweet spot is one to three words. Four is an absolute max. I think the character count is somewhere in, like, 50 or 55 characters. And the reason for this is because when a person is viewing your email in their email client on their phone, on their Gmail, on the desktop, whatever, they see three things. They see who the sender is. There's nothing you can do about that unless you change your name, I guess. They see the subject line, which we're talking about now. And importantly, they see the preview line. The preview line is the first line or two of your email. About the first 20 words of your email, they see that in the preview line. So if you before even opening the email. So if your email subject line is 20 words long, then you're not allowing them to see that first line of your email, which as previously discussed is personalized. So you're you're just cannibalizing that really important real estate for no reason, for no reason at all. So really focus on keeping that subject line short. And then if possible, it should be related to that first line in your email. So, Nick, in the e in the example I gave before, if my opening line of the email is saw that you hired 20 new sales staff over the last six months. Congrats. Then my subject line should be hiring quickly. Simple as that. You know, one to three words, just something that has to do with the first line that's gonna pique their interest that segues nicely or transitions nicely into that first line of the email that allows them to see the subject line and that first line of the email before opening the email. So, Kyle, I think this is spot on. Just enough to pique the interest, but what you're not doing to the point earlier is you're not saying things like automate your lead routing as your forwards. Right? No marketing advertising, no selling whatsoever, just enough to get the open. That's right. Yeah. In that example, Arman, automate your lead routing with or automate company token names lead routing with my company's name. You'll see that a lot. Automate Clari's lead routing with LeanData. And that's garbage. It's so bad. Like, don't do that. That's useful for a landing page, like a personalized landing page. If I went to leandata.com/clarity and I saw that, I'd be like, oh, cool. This is for me. It's not good for an outbound email. Because again, I'm not seeking this information out. So instead of automate Clari's lead routing with lean data, just do lead routing. That's your subject line. As simple as that. And then in the first line should be something to do with, hey, notice you just hired a new head of demand generation. Imagine you're expanding your your lead gen efforts. What are you doing to make sure that all the leads get in the right hands of the right reps at the right time? Simple as that. So, take that complex tokenized subject line and just distill it down to the most important parts of that subject line, and you're gonna find you're gonna get way more open since nothing else. So, Kyle, in that example, I know I'm sort of skipping around the email here. Your call to action was not a meeting. It was a question about the process that you could help with. Can you talk about the call to action a little bit? Yeah. This is probably the biggest mistake from a tactical how the email is written tail of the tape sort of, sort of way is people on a first email or second or third email, they're asking for somebody's time. And I know, Armand and Nick, you you both have talked about this before with various guests. And Gong's data on this is unassailable. They they did a huge study with billions or millions. I can't remember of data points, and they found that on a cold email, if you're asking for somebody's time, you are shooting yourself in the foot. You are reducing the response rate by I can't even remember the the amount, but it's a huge reduction in response rate. Instead, the recommended path forward to get better results is to ask interest or curiosity based call to action or provide those call to action. So instead of, can we spend thirty minutes to talk about this? It's, are you interested in learning more? Or let me know if you're curious to see more. It's what Josh Braun calls a low friction ask. There's not a lot of skin in the game for somebody, and it's piquing their curiosity, as you mentioned before, Nick. It's saying, are if you're interested in anything that I just said above, let me know. Happy to provide more information. So really focus on those interest based or curiosity based calls to action. And really, truly as simple as, are you interested in learning more? Are you curious to see more? If you just go with those two subject lines, you're gonna find you're gonna get far, far more responses. And because the point is creating conversations, the point is not to get meetings. I'm gonna repeat that for everybody who's on a meeting based quota. The point is not to get meetings. The point is to create conversations. And so that is what these interest based calls to action do. They allow you to have more back and forths to build more relationships, to earn more meetings eventually. So play a bit of a longer game here and ensure that you're positioning yourself as somebody who's gonna be educating the people that you're reaching out to and genuinely helping them, and you'll find more success. So what's the approach here? They email me back, and they say, I am interested in learning more. Do I now email back and forth with them five or six times to the point where it's like, alright. It makes sense to get on a call, or what's the best practice when they say yes? Yes. I'm interested in learning more. It's a really good question, Nick. My favorite approach to this is what's the best way that you learn? Are you more of somebody who likes to watch a video and and learn by watching, seeing the product in action? Are you more of a reader? You wanna study the white paper. You wanna know the technical details, which are you a or b? Let me know. And if they, you know, depending on how they respond, if they say, yeah, I'm more of a video type person. I wanna see something in action. You say, great. We've got all those videos for you. I can I'll send them over. Or we can do a live call with one of our product experts. You can get all of your questions answered in real time as you see this product tour. Is that something that'd be better for you? Would that expedite your learning? So that's the type of way that that I typically handle it. It adds a little bit of back and forth, but again, you're trying to position yourself as somebody who actually cares about the prospect. And so you're saying, what's the best? What how do you prefer to learn? Let me know. We've got all the resources And just see what they say, and you can go from there. So you have the subject line. You have your intro paragraph. And in that intro paragraph, to go back there, it sounds like you even have a question in that intro. Is that right? Not all the time, Armand, but more often than not, it typically lends itself to, like, you're asking a rhetorical question so that you're teeing yourself up for the response. So it's it's kind of a nice little device just to allow the email to flow pretty well. So if that is useful for you, by all means, include that question in the first in the first line. And so, again, let's let's write this email for for Nick who, in this imaginary world, is leading a sales team. I know very unlikely, but we'll, you know, suspend your disbelief momentarily. So Nick is a sales leader. He's has just hired, 20 new staff over six months. We found that insight on LinkedIn. We our subject line is hiring quickly. And then the first line is, hey, Nick or Nick. Hey. Hi. Hello. I don't care. Just don't say dear, sir, or madam. We won't belabor that one. So, hey, Nick. Saw that you just hired 20 new sales staff. What are you gonna do to make sure you're coaching them all to hit quota? Whatever you're, you know, in this solution, in this scenario, we're selling Clari. So bear with me. Then the second line needs to be some sort of challenge that the Knicks of the world, the sales leadership personas of the world care about. So as companies are scaling their processes, things often break. How are you gonna make sure your forecasting process keeps up? So that's another question for him. So we're saying, hey, you just hired a bunch of people and we're implying a lot here. So we're we don't necessarily have to call out explicitly every single thing that we know Nick is experiencing in this new world with 20 new sales reps that he's really hyper focused on making his number. We don't need to call out everything. We just need to say something provocative, Like your current system is going to break. Now we're not going to say that, but we're implying it by saying as company scale processes that had gotten them there tend to break down. What are you doing to ensure that doesn't happen to your forecasting cadence? You know, something like that. So we're showing him a challenge that either exists currently or that will exist in a future state. We're also implying that I know what the heck I'm talking about because I'm working with other sales leaders where I've gleaned this insight. This is not something that should come as a surprise to Nick. This shows him that I hopefully can be some sort of trusted adviser to him. So I'll stop there. The challenge that Nick is facing or is likely going to face, showcasing that I understand his universe and showing him that he can trust that the information that I have is gonna be useful for him. So this is gonna be really in the weeds. But one thing I always struggled with, Kyle, is I was always like, I need to personalize and describe the problem in the first body of text, and then I need to describe how I solve the problem in the second and then ask in the third. And it was always I mean, this sounds in the weeds, but it was always hard for me to stuff both personalization and the problem that they'll face in one paragraph in in one sentence. Right? And so it sounds like the total email, you're actually breaking personalization and the problem into two separate bodies of text. And my guess is the whole email is gonna be around four. Is that right? That's right. Exactly, Armand. So one or two lines personalization introducing the fact that I know something that's going on in mixed universe. Paragraph number two. Again, one or two lines, one or two sentences is not more than that, showing Nick that I understand the challenge he's gonna face. And then the next line is showing him the solution or potential solution that my product or service or our company is offering. And then the the call to action, as we mentioned, can either be baked into that third line, Armand, or it can be called out separately as a fourth line. But but that's basically it. And this all can be done pretty easily in 50 to a 100 words. So one of the things that reps tend to struggle with is they their solutions do so many different things. Clari doesn't help with only forecasting. You help with Salesforce data entry. You help with, obviously, the forecasting piece. Like, there's a lot that goes in there. And so do I just give the high level? Do I just give one problem that you solve? Do I save some of those problems in the bag for future emails down in the sequence? How do you describe Clari in a succinct way that's still crisp enough that it actually resonates with a real problem? Yeah. It's a great question, Armand. And this is something that people struggle with, especially marketing people when they're writing outbound emails is they say, we can do everything end to end, 360 degrees, and then they'll have seven bullet points about all the different things that they do. And it's like, that's not useful for an outbound email because, again, the usefulness of the research that I've done about Nick is I understand that he has something that's really top of mind, and he has some acute pains for whatever he and his company are experiencing right now. And I want to address as best I can that acute pain in as simple a language as succinct a way as I possibly can. And I can hit on that in a couple different ways as you mentioned, Nick. Like, we just talked about the scenario where we're talking about Nick's forecasting process breakdown, but let's talk about data entry. So it's the same sort of cadence for the email. Hey, Nick. You just hired 20 new people. How are you gonna ensure that everything that needs to get into Salesforce is actually getting into Salesforce? Reps, not famous for their data entry skills. Clari automates all of that for you, giving your sellers back time to sell so that you're bringing as much revenue as possible. Let me know if you're interested in learning more. One key point at a time, one salient challenge that Nick is facing, one partial solution of what Clari brings to the table, and it's allowing you to build a cadence or build a sequence that builds, on itself so that it's kinda like this pyramid where you're setting a foundation of awareness, and then you're getting more and more pointed about what your solution can do. And that's really, really a a useful way to design a sequence is by calling out one specific thing, one specific challenge and solution in each touch point. Can we talk a little bit about some of the other elements that are present in an email? And what I mean by that is, like, the structure, the formatting, things like bullets and bold and italics, what you're doing with stuff like links and and your stance on stuff like attachments. As a general rule, the larger the company that you're targeting, the fewer external elements you should include in your email. Enterprise companies have stronger gates that allow external emails to come through. So try and avoid any images. I'm typically not gonna be a big gift guy in my outbound emails. That's a personal preference. Do your thing. Attachments are a no no. More than two links is gonna set you up for email deliverability issues, and this is particular to enterprise, accounts. So, you know, companies over, call it, a thousand employees tend to have some sort of these guardrails in place. So focus on deliverability. And, again, this should be part of your AB test that you're doing. Same exact email, one with three links, one with zero. See what happens. Email open rates, email response rates, and and go from there. As it relates to the bold and italic and things like that, I can take it or leave it. If your email is abiding by a lot of these principles that we're talking about already, you're already ensuring that it's easy to read. And so the bold and italic and things that, you know, make something pop out are kinda superfluous to me at that point because you've already optimized for, this email to be easy to read. So I already mentioned that the email should be roughly 50 to a 100 words. That's a general best practice. I personally allow room for up to a 125 if the personalization is really good. If I could figure out the right way to tie the USC alumnus story into Clari forecasting, that might take a little bit more real estate. So, okay, up to a 125 if personalization is really good. But for templated general emails, 50 to a 100 words. We've alluded to this already, but separate thoughts go on separate lines. Plenty of white space. And I know, Armand, I've seen you post about this before. When it's a block of text, nobody's gonna read it. Like, if your your information is buried, your call to action is buried in this block of text, you're pretty much guaranteeing that it's not digestible. It's not skimmable by the human eye and the human brain. So people in all likelihood are not gonna read every word of your email. I'm sorry. I know you you poured over every single word that's in there, but guess what? People aren't gonna read them. So you want your separate thoughts to go on separate lines so that when they skim that email, when not if, they skim that email, they're getting the thrust of the message. They're getting the main points. Those are the types of things I think that are gonna optimize your reply rate. You mentioned something that I wanna make sure we don't brush over is you said, hey. For some of your other accounts, where you're sending, like, non super personalized emails. Right? One of the things that I struggle with is my guess is you like everyone else. You have some c tier accounts. And I I don't wanna go in and tailor every single email for an HR specialist at a c tier account, super below the line. But I do wanna reach out to them because oftentimes, it's a good wedge into the org. And so what are you doing for those folks? Are you doing persona based generalized tailoring, or maybe you just should just tell me to tailor everything. I don't know. It's the degree of tailoring, Armand, that is worth, spending some time on here. And so, again, I'll I'll go back to this point about the firmographic personalization that you can do. And I think too few people, again, I'll I'll reiterate at this point, don't view firmographic personalization as, quote, unquote, true personalization. They think it's not as valid for whatever reason. So my suggestion would be, you know, you probably have I don't know how many, c tier accounts you have in your patch, but let's say you have 50 of them. Pop on thirty minutes of president's club, listen to it. And in a spreadsheet, just go one by one and look at LinkedIn insights and see how many HR staff have they hired or fired in the last six months. Is it plus 20%, minus 15%? Just go and fill in that spreadsheet row by row. You're listening you're really gonna be listening to Nick and Arman as you're doing this more or less mindless work, but that then is the token that you can use in this templated email, and you need to now have two emails. One for if there's been, growth of some sort or one if there's been retraction of some sort. You need to make sure that your message makes sense for both of those scenarios, and then you fire off your emails to as many people as you want. So that's the way to scale this kind of still tailored, but a very light touch tailoring in a way that's gonna be, actually gonna resonate with the people that you're reaching out to. So how many different sequences is your team maintaining at any given point in time? Because my guess is it sounds like you have a couple different sequences for different buckets. Is that right? Yeah. That's exactly right, Armand. I think we have about 30,000. We have too many. Definitely have too many. But the way that we try and structure it is we try and have our above the line and below the line sequences by persona. So it doesn't it doesn't bloat our sequence count too much. I I would argue we'd probably still have a few too many, but the way that we try and structure it is for our above the line sequences, these are, folks that are gonna be economic buyers or decision makers, or at the very least, they're gonna be really powerful use case champions. They have some clout in the organization. And the sequence for that is really it's not filled in at all. You know, the email templates that are in there are more or less blank. They're just reminders for what the right timing is for you to send your really personalized notes to them. And there's maybe a snippet or a line or two about, you know, if this is a sales leader above the line sequence, there's gonna be a line or two about a challenge of the sales leader faces that you can write your email around. But the point of the sequence is really one of ensuring that the timing of the sequence, call this day, LinkedIn this day, email this day, assuring that that timing is abided abided by. That's not the right word. Whatever. The below the line sequences are all templatized. As we've talked about the structure of a light personalization, semi tailored first line, and then more or less stock templated second, third lines with the call to action. And the point of the below the line sequences again is to either do some fact finding on the company, understand more about their sales structure and their forecasting process and the things, the information that we would then use in the above line personalized sequences, or it's to get some sort of meeting with them, you know, for our our sales team to give them a demo because we feel like they could just build some groundswell and then help us with an evaluation. So that's kind of the way that we do it. We have every persona that we care about. We have above the line and below the line. So two main sequences for every persona. Alright, Kyle. This has been great. I've been I've been writing down, like, a madman stuff about email length and subject lines, and apparently, I'm a sales leader now or an HR generalist, one of the two. But we gotta move to our final question because we're running out of time here, Kyle. And the final question is the same one as the first time you were on the show, but hopefully, you have a different answer. We talked about a lot of things people should be doing related to their cold emails and general outbound outreach practices. But we gotta talk about a bad habit. So the question for you is what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople doing that you think they need to kick because it's hurting them more than it's helping? The one thing I think salespeople need to stop doing, and this will not come as a surprise to you if you listen to the rest of this episode. The one thing they need to stop doing is just sending what's given to them and putting their hands up in the air and saying, I don't control the emailing. You know, this comes from our marketing team or it comes from my manager. Woe is me. I'm just gonna go and hit send on these things because quote unquote, that's what I was hired to do. That is not what you were hired to do. You were hired because you have a brain and you need to use your brain. So stop not using your brain and think strategically about how you can add value to the email sequences, the individual templates, all those sorts of things. You, mister and missus salesperson, are the closest person to your prospect. You're the one getting feedback every single day from the people that you're interacting with. Use that feedback to inform the way that you're messaging to them. Use your brain. And I promise you're gonna enjoy your job more. You're gonna add more value, and you're gonna get better results. Love it. Start using your brain, everybody. Kyle, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? No. I don't think so, guys. Should I be plugging anything? I I don't have anything to sell. Follow you on LinkedIn. Yeah. Follow me on LinkedIn. I I try and post pretty regularly about things that I have experience and or expertise in. The number of things I have expertise in are is very, very small. So, I'm normally on the theme of trying to help salespeople, top of funnel in particular, do the jobs better. Beautiful. Kyle, thanks so much for coming on, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Your top four takeaways from the episode with Kyle Coleman include, number one, four paragraph emails. Not even four paragraph. Four bodies of text, four lines, whatever it might be. Keep them short. Paragraph number one is the tailoring. Paragraph number two is the problem. Paragraph number three is the way you solve the problem. And then number four is the light ask. Takeaway number two, end your emails not asking for time every single time. Everybody asks for fifteen or thirty minutes, but ask if this is even moderately interesting. Ask for interest, a lighter lower commitment ask. Number three, keep your emails link lite and GIF lite and image lite. It'll get you sent to spam. And then number four, you can personalize at scale. Here's what you gotta do. No matter what kind of personalization you do, you can't be like, hey, Nick. You wrestled. Clari helps you forecast. You have to tie it to the business problem you solve. For your c tier accounts, you can find a bucket either based off of their company size, their industry, whatever it might be, and a problem those folks in that bucket typically tend to experience. And then for your a tiers, you can go really deep and wide. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out?
