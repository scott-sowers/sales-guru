## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to president's club. I'm your host, Nick Sigelski, and I'm joined with my cohost, Jen Allen. And today, we've got Julia Carter who is an AE at Marpipe. And part of the reason I'm excited for this episode is there is so much advice out there that is framed as if you have to do the perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect thing. And oftentimes, perfection is the enemy of good. And Julia is a good, good, might I even say, great AE. Jen, why should people listen? There is so much talk about the need to personalize emails, but not every AE can afford to take thirty minutes and personalize every single one. What I love about what we learned from Julia is she talks about how to nail triggers and relevance to make your email stand out. A three, a two, a one that this episode might trigger you if you're obsessed with Uber personalizing. Today's show is brought to you by Nook.

Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright. Julia, welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. So my first one is that when you're building a prospecting list, do not mass export it. Build your entire list based off of a trigger. So for my company, we are like an ad tech tool. So what I do is I look at, alright, is this company running ads? Check. Are they running the type of ads I want? And then from there, I find the people. So I know that everyone on my list is a perfect fit for me versus just exporting people like, oh, they are in my territory with my title at my company size. In this way, your list is clean, and you've got a good group of people to reach out to. Beautiful. What's number two? My second one is make your email subject lines heinously boring. The most dull subject line you could ever think of because these salesy ones where it's like, if this podcast was reaching out to me, it'd be, like, thirty minutes to president's club, ex Julia intro chat. I'm deleting that. So make it something really boring like podcast episode, intro, episode, interview talk, anything like that, and I find that it's a little less deceiving. It gets clicked on more. Well, I'm glad you didn't delete my email, Julia. Round us out. What's number three? The third one is if you are an AE, just close loss all of your ops in beginning stages that don't have a next step on the calendar because, respectfully, like, it's just going nowhere probably, and you're wasting your time. So to book a next step, this gets things moving along much faster. Like, do not listen to the advice out there where people are like, hey. Do I have permission to suggest a next step? No. You don't have permission. Just literally ask them when's a good time to reconnect. Nine times out of 10, they'll give you a big time frame. Just throw out a time, like, yo. Does Tuesday 1PM work? They're probably gonna say yes. If they say yes, cool. If they say no, then, like, bye. Not interested. Thank you. Well, I've been hearing not interested a lot when I send out prospecting emails. And we were talking on the preshow, and you've got a pretty spicy take on personalization versus relevance in cold emails, and I'm hoping you can share that with us. Yes. So I don't personalize anything. Like, nothing. Because no one cares. If I'm writing a cold email for business purposes, it better be about their business. And I feel like a lot of people out there, like, irrelevant, but they don't really explain how. And I think of relevance more as, like, why I'm reaching out to that specific person. So I think that that has a much more impactful message versus being like, hey. I saw you went to school here. Like, cool. We both live in New York. Sure. No. I don't get what you're saying to me. For the folks in the audience who are like, personalization, relevance, aren't they the same thing? Can you talk to me about what the difference between those things are? Alright. So I define personalization as you are personalizing the message to that person. More so, I find in b two b cold outreach, people use this as things on someone's LinkedIn profile, like their title, where they're from, something in their bio. And all of that is cool, but none of that has anything to do with why you're reaching out to them. Sure. They have a title at a business that you could help. But beyond that, it's all useless fluff information. And the person who receives a message like that is gonna be like, yeah. I know I'm the director of marketing. I know I live in New York. Like, you're not bringing anything new to the table. So instead, going with relevance, which is more of a why you're reaching out, the person will get the message and be like, oh, like, they know that I deal with making these documents all day. They can help me fix that or whatever it might be. So it's really the why versus the what. So I think there's different levels of relevance. There's a level of relevance, and it's kind of along what you just described of, like, I'm reaching out to you because you're a VP of marketing, and I see a lot of that. How do you get layers deeper in terms of relevance? And can you share maybe one example from your world? For sure. And I think a lot of people get lost because it is really hard to think about it. But if you think about your product and what you solve for, there's always something a little bit deeper besides, oh, I'm automating tasks. I'm making you ROI, like, whatever the hell that means. There's something else going on there that the person who's using your tool wants to use you for. So for me, like, how I go about finding deeper relevance is really thinking, like, specifically what my tool does. So I like to find little triggers of, oh, if this person does x, then, like, y would be relevant. So for me in my day to day, we sell an advertising software. But instead of me going after advertisers, I go after advertisers who are running Facebook ads. And not only Facebook ads, but a specific type of Facebook ad that is undesigned because we design them. So the natural progression is, like, I'm gonna look at these ads that's relevant to them, gonna reach out. So I think what you're describing there, I used to absolutely fall in the trap. So when I used to sell sales training, I'm like, okay. Let me just reach out to sales leaders with big sales teams because those would be the biggest deals. And what I failed to appreciate is not every sales leader needs to prioritize sales training right now. And rather, look to the business and say, are there any indicators or, like, you're talking about triggers that might suggest that they're having a hard time with sales? So they've done a recent layoff or they're seeing lots of turnover throughout different levels of the sales organization. It's still a hypothesis. It's not a fact, and I like the way that you framed it. It's our best guess. We're using the information that we have available to make a hypothesized guess. How do you land that tone? Because I think one of the other big missteps I see is there's a really assumptive tone that a lot of sellers make that can kind of get us into trouble. So talk to us a little bit about you see something that's a trigger, how do you phrase it in your email itself? Totally. And I agree. It really is a best guess. There's probably never gonna be a one to one. Oh, this person needs this. They said they need this unless you come across, like, a example, which would be amazing, but probably unrealistic. So I think framing, starting with the best guess or the trigger, I take a more of an assumptive take. I'm just like, hey. I saw your white background ads. Like, have you ever tried designing them before? I just lead with exactly what I found just to start off so they know immediately upon the preview of the email, like, why this email is going to them and what the email is gonna be about. So I like to start off with it. I know some people don't think it's correct to be assumptive because it's like, well, I don't know if they're doing that. But in my point of view, when you're reaching out to people, you should know why you're reaching out. And if you don't know why, you should act like you know why because the person will probably correct you or they just won't respond. So you may as well just leave with confidence. I think one thing you are doing is you are still using an unsure tone in your question. You're assumptive in your hypothesis, but you don't immediately say, like, oh, it must be because you've never been able to figure out how to design a white space or a non white space ad. Clearly, I don't sell what you sell. But I think you're still framing that question to invite disagreement. And I think the way that you phrase that is really, really cool to me because, again, it's not overly assumptive. Like, you're clearly struggling, and you don't know how to do anything, which I think is off putting. You're using the question to kind of invite that back. Totally. And I do use a lot of questions, I find, because I just feel like it is a little bit like, have you ever tried doing this? You might wanna try doing that, which just leads to be a little softer in the tone. But, yeah, I definitely like to ask questions. I know some people are like, if you add too many questions, no one's gonna respond. But, like, whatever. People are responding to me, so we'll take it. I love it. So to recap what you're doing here, there's sort of different layers to the triggers that you're looking for. If you look at the highest layer, you could just reach out to people that aren't advertising. The next layer down, though, is advertisers who are running ads on Facebook specifically. And then the layer beneath that, which is how specific you're getting, is you are looking for advertisers running ads on Facebook where the ads have white backgrounds. Yes. What I'm wondering is how the hell are you finding that other than just scrolling Facebook all day, which is something that I think my mom might do or maybe arm hunt, but my guess is you're not doing it that inefficiently. How are you even finding this? Honestly, it is kind of inefficient. So ads are public on most platforms. So there is something called Facebook ad library, and that's what I use as my, like, trigger resource where I look up manually each company. Some companies you can assume, like Nordstrom, you can assume they're doing it. But God knows what athletic company, like, I don't know what they're running. So I do have to manually check. And then once I verify that they have something I can solve for, then I'll find the people. It honestly is, like, not the most efficient, but I'm on the boat where I'd rather have a list of a plus prospects because that means every meeting will probably be an a plus meeting versus just keeping it too broad and kinda guessing because then people will be like, why are you emailing me? And then they'll block me and cancel me. I just don't want that. So that's one trigger you're looking for. Are there any others that you use, or is that the sole one that you rely on, Julia? We're more of a point solution. So, honestly, I just go off that main one. But I think for more all in one type people, if you do multiple things, there's different ways to find little hints as to how you could help them. So I think there's definitely lots of available databases out there that can help you guess that someone would be a good fit, but that's it for me. Awesome. Even at thirty minutes to presidents club, when I'm reaching out to our sponsors, I'm looking for folks who have had a messaging change recently or they have a big product announcement or they just started their own podcast or their own webinar series, and that usually informs my perspective on why I reach out to them. And you're right. That's so much better than saying, Jen, I saw that you went to Penn State. I saw that you listed all this, by the way, and having that, like, very, very awkward friction y transition. So I wanna ask you about how these triggers inform your overall outreach strategy. You talked about stuff on the pre call about stuff, like using images, and I wanna ask about that. I wanna ask about the preview text of your messages. I wanna, like, figure out what you are doing because I know you're booking a lot of meetings via email, and I'd love to hear about your strategy. For sure. So now that we have an a plus star list that I know why I'm reaching out, obviously, the next step is to contact them. And I kinda have a couple ways of going about it. So I probably am, like, the anti poster child for best practices. I'm guilty of being a mass blaster, and I'm guilty of just not really changing a lot of my messaging. For context, I'm the only seller on my team right now. So I just don't have time in my day all the time to do these tasks. But so one of the ways that I can, like, effectively communicate what I'm saying is I use a lot of images, which all the, like, deliverability gurus are probably like, oh my god. Don't use images. You're gonna get blocked. Well, whatever. The images get me replies, so I will take a couple blocks for a hit. So I'll include images of the brand's ads or just highlighting, in general, the before and after of what my tool can do for these people. So they take one glance at my email, and they're like, I understand the idea. When it's not personalized, it's just like a generic before and after. But when it's personalized, I can do it with their own ads and stuff. But that's definitely how I'm using images today. So you know me. Right? Like, I'm big on relevance. But I think oftentimes people assume that means you need to write a unique email to every single person that you're writing. I think one of the things I love about what you're sharing is if you really nail relevance, you don't have to create a unique story for every single customer. So talk to us about when you're sending out these emails. You mentioned, I think, you sell to retailers. Are you sending these out to lots of different people inside of the business? Is it just there's one person and it's always the same person? How do you think about, if you wanna call it, multithreading? Definitely. So I really try not to hit up that many people. I try to keep it really, really tight in terms of who I'm reaching out to. I like to bucket my titles. I have two title, booleans and a boolean. If you don't know it, it's like quotations with titles in it, and you can, like, mass search lots of different titles on LinkedIn. So I'll have a broad boolean, which is marketing people, like, broad. And then I have a really specific boolean, like paid social marketer, someone who's a branch off. And for small companies, I go for more broad titles because they probably only have two people I can reach out to. But at big companies, I go really specific. And something else I do when I'm reaching out to people is I don't really hit up the execs. A lot of people are, like, get into the power. Like, the power doesn't know how to run a Facebook campaign. Okay? He doesn't know what it is. So I'm going after the people who know what I'm talking about, because I've just found that I generate a lot more replies that way. Not to say I don't shoot my shot with the CMO, but I feel like this whole get into the power isn't always the most effective way to go about things. If you compare the altitude of the person that you need one over to win a deal against the altitude of the person that you're reaching out to, I'm curious about that. Like, do you still need the sign off from the CMO, but you're still going to this person? Or I'm curious about that strata difference. I've rarely involved the CMO in a lot of deals. Sometimes they're the signers, sometimes they're not. I just find that if the champion in the team is bought in, they're gonna tell their CMO, like, we need to do this. And we've closed a ton of great enterprise logos without any sort of involvement from, like, really high up people. So I don't think you necessarily need it. Sometimes, I think the internal people will do the work for you. So, yeah, that's my take on it, which I guess is kinda hot. What I like about it, Julia, is if your average deal size was $800,000,000 a year and it was a cross functional software that was gonna revolutionize the business's operations. Like, if you're selling Salesforce, for example, yeah, you probably wanna get with the exec. But it sounds like the level of altitude that you need to get a deal done isn't necessarily going to the CMO or the SVP of marketing, and you actually might slow things down overshooting where you land at. So you talked about your approach where if you don't get a next step, you're like, no deal done. What do you do if you don't get a response to your first email? What does your follow-up strategy look like if you have one at all? So in my follow-up emails, I'm not using thoughts. A lot of people, they're like, I'm gonna send this bump email, and it's like, thoughts? Thoughts on what? What am I to have a thought on? Because you don't have any words in your email. It just says thoughts. I mean, clearly, the email wasn't good enough to get a response. So you need to just humble yourself and provide more examples as to, like, why they might wanna talk to you, even if I'm just booking a time with an inbound person of reminding them why they wanna speak to me and what value I can bring. So in all of my follow ups, I I usually just thread them together because they'll kinda reference the other one. I'll just hound them with more examples or, like, a client story or, like, more ways I think we can help them just to continue the items. So usually in my second email, I'm just like, hey. Like, only asking because here's what other brands in your category are doing, and then that's it. I just show them examples of what other brands in the category are doing. And usually, they get jealous. They're like, oh my god. What? I wanna do that. So then let's stay on this idea of, like, an inbound lead. How many times will you do that before you cut bait and say, forget them? Honestly, it depends. We don't have a marketing team, so, you know, the inbounds. We don't really know who's coming in a lot of the time. If it's really good, obviously, I'll keep pounding it. But if it's kind of like, god knows what this company is, they're not really running ads. Honestly, if they're not running ads, I'll tell them in the email. I'm like, yo. Do you know we do? Because I don't think this is gonna work out here. But I'll usually send, like, two or three emails because, you know, sometimes things get lost. You just gotta bump stuff up. I'm guilty of not responding to stuff I should sometimes. So And then for an outbound, same question. Let's say you've got a trigger. You see they fit that trigger. At what point do you stop contacting them, or do you stop contacting them? How do you think about engaging those people without being, I guess, too much outreach? So my cadences are kinda long. I would say I hit them with six emails over a month, which a lot of people are like, that's too many. But this is more on the automated side of things where I'm just letting that rip. And then when we put them in stuff multiple times a year, I'm like, yo, I prospected you. Reduce, reuse, recycle. We're gonna find you again. I've been going after some of the same people for, like, three years now at my old job and at this job. So it a lot of reusing, but I'm trying to cut it down now to fewer emails. Because sometimes I do take a more manual approach if I'm like, yo, I really need this person. What informs that decision? What makes you say, okay. I'm gonna put this prospect in a more manual cadence versus I'm gonna let those outbound emails automated emails rip? Honestly, it just depends on how much time I have. The automated emails tend to hit decently well. Obviously, if I include a photo of their own ads, it tends to work better than a photo of just a generic ad. But if I am in meetings all day, I don't have time to just rip out all these emails. And also finding my prospects is so manual, so scraping up a list of 50 people takes so long, and then emailing them takes so long. So it's really just depends on how much time I have. Like, Thanksgiving or November was a total wash. It was so slow. So I was just ripping, typing them out all day long. Just beep, bop, send, and then, you know, see what happens. Is there any point in your manual process where you find yourself using personalization? A little bit. Sometimes. Yeah. But it's more about the brand and the ads they're running and, like, oh, you have a sale coming up? You should probably put some stuff on your ads if you have a sale. It's more geared around that. It's more tailored to the brand. But, yeah, I don't really include much about unless we have some crazy connection where I'm like, holy crap. You went to my high school, which doesn't happen a lot, but has happened before. Oh my gosh. Actually, I wanna ask you about this because a lot of your prospects are marketers at these retailers. And I know there is so much seasonality with some of these businesses and the way that they're, like, totally slammed around the holidays and maybe a little bit less busy during the summer. And I'm wondering if the seasonality of your prospects business informs your outreach at all. Yes. Oh my god. My year was done in October. That was the 2023 for me. It totally informs it because Black Friday, good night. I'm not getting a reply in November. Black Friday is, like, the event of the year. When I was in SDR, for context, I was smashing it. I was 300%, 400%, 200%. November, 46%. And that's not because, like, anything speaking to me, it's just seasonality is so real. But you kinda have to know obviously, everything is seasonal, and there's never a good time to reach out because it's, like, oh, back to school, summer. There's always stuff going on. But I definitely use those lulls to catch up on more, I would say, almost housekeeping activities. Like, let's brainstorm, like, the new cadence to try and get people to meet with me next year. So I'll use the lulls to my advantage for other things that aren't necessarily booking meetings, but seasonality is so real. My year has been done for a long time. So knowing your approach to qualification on opportunities, what do you do when you reach out to Jen and it's December 6 and Jen is like, yeah. I'd be open to talking with you, Julia, but this is a really busy time of year. How's March? If there's a reason they wanna meet in March, they probably wanna meet in March. A lot of people are like, we need to speak with you now. I'll always kinda just throw it out, like, oh, you know, just so you kinda know the deal when March comes. It might be worth connecting, like, quickly. But, also, if they're asking for March, it's probably because this makes sense to do in March, and we're not gonna start till March anyways. So I don't really have a problem putting time on for later. Obviously, it sucks, but then it's such a nice present when it's March, and you're like, oh my god. I have this meeting on my calendar, and I forgot about it. So I think it's fine if they say that. That. And what are you doing in between now and March to try to avoid that meeting falling off? Because I think one of the things you'd shared with me is that you've got a really good show up rate. So I imagine there's some interesting things you're doing there. Yeah. I've had two or three no shows this whole year. So we're banging them out. They all love me. But yeah. So I'll do this quote, unquote, like, thinking of you that's, like, really stupid. And I'll be like, oh my god. Here are some of the examples of these creatives that these other brands ran for Black Friday. Like, maybe this will be inspiration for you for you planning your Christmas campaigns. Or I'll be like, oh, I remember you said that you really wanna run this March Madness sale. Like, here's some cool, like, results from a similar thing. And I'll just do it every once in a while, and I'll set little calendar reminders for myself. Like, yo, email Becky about this, and then I'll email Becky. I just booked a meeting today with a girl doing exactly that. We spoke a while ago, and she's like, I'm kinda wanna do this for q '1. So I emailed her today. I'm like, oh my god. Thinking of you. Here's a school template. So I definitely like to do that. That is so awesome. And that is the right way to add value because you're not just blasting them with some generic case study or something. It's really, really smart because what you're actually doing is you're, like, almost selling the pre meeting, but, also, they're gonna show up now to that meeting being like, I saw that Nordstrom thing. We need to have stuff that looks like that. And now you can start asking about that. And so many salespeople stop once they have the meeting booked, and the thinking of you message that you send is so awesome because they're like, oh, one, Julia's legit. She's a real human being. Two, okay. I really shouldn't no show her or move this meeting because she clearly did some level of effort. Folks reciprocate the effort that you show. But then three, that meeting is so much better because you actually sold a little bit pre meeting. Totally. And this goes to, I think, when sometimes brands are like, the timing's off. Let's connect x y z time down the line. Just keep little nuggets. You're like, oh my god. This other brand did exactly what you said you wanted to do, and look how awesome it was. And it's just keeping the flame alive. So when you rehash it out with them, it's not totally cold. It's just lukewarm. You can't do a podcast episode on cold emails without a strong opinion on subject lines. So one of your actionable takeaways was make it boring. Tell us why you make it boring and share some examples of what people typically do and how you would rewrite it. Yes. So there's this whole debate on subject line. I would categorize them into, like, three categories. There's, like, the sketchy subject line where it's, like, insert payment or, like, payment reminder, and people are like, holy crap. Payment reminder. Click. And then it's a sales email, and you're like, oh, okay. So I don't really like the sketchy ones. That's just shady, and it puts a bad taste in people's mouth. Then there's the salesy ones, which maybe worked, like, five, ten years ago, where people are like, Julia x Jen catch up, my company x your company. And those are just not it anymore. People know it's a sales email, and who wants to click on a sales email? So I avoid those, but I like to do the kind of boring subject line because, first of all, it's camouflage to look internal because it's like SDR team quota or, like, dynamic ads. It's boring, but it also has to do with your message. So it's not deceiving. It has to do with the subject, and it just not sketchy. It is what it is, and it's not screaming sales. Well, Julia, this has been a phenomenal episode on some cold emailing, and we're running out of time. And we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question for you is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Do not mass export prospect list. Don't do it. Because at at the end of the day, sales is very simple. You find people, and you contact people, and you talk to people. And if the people that you're finding are trash, everything else is trash. You've screwed with the entire process. So really be picky about who you're reaching out to and know why. And it's better to have a small all star list of people who are gonna be your all star people than have this big list of trash that you now have to, like, follow-up with, and that's gonna get you nowhere. So don't do that. It's easy to mass export, but it hurts you in the long run. So stop it right now and delete all of your lists and cancel them. Boom. Beautiful. Julia, thank you for joining us.

One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode with Julia Carter. Number one, don't shy away from including images in your prospecting emails, particularly if you sell a visual solution that Julia uses before and after images in her prospecting emails, they can teach the buyer way more than a thousand word email might. Number two is if you have a meeting booked with a prospect and you've got some time to juice that meeting a little bit, add some value with a thinking of you email that shows some examples of what some of their peers are doing with you or what other similar customers are doing. It's a great way to start selling before you even have that first meeting. Number three. When you open your email using a trigger based approach, state your observation confidently and then follow it up with an unsure tone question. So Julia gave the example of here's what I've seen your ads look like. Have you ever tried to do x? Number four, when it comes to subject lines, there's three camps. One, intentionally misleading. So things like late payment fees that try to trick you into an open. Two, there's the overly marketing y subject lines that are, like, Jen, 10 times your ROI. Julia's preferred approach is number three, which is intentionally boring. Subject lines like podcast episode that are camouflaged to look like they might be something that was sent internally.
