## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. I'm your host, Nick Sigelski, and I'm joined by my wonderful cohost, Armond Farrokh. And today, we have Andrew Johnston who is the head of sales at Superhuman. And this episode, this product Superhuman is the reason that Armond has started responding to my emails. Armond, why should people listen? Well, if any tool can get me to respond to Nick, you know it's good. But in seriousness, guys, this is probably the single best episode we've ever had on product led growth prospecting sales process overall. Andrew goes through what to do when you see people using your product on an account, how you should reach out to those folks, how you should decide between land versus expand, and then how once you land, how you can ultimately creep across the organization and and get a wall to wall deal. And a three, a two, a one creep into this episode. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to knock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Andrew. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. The first one is, overcomplicating initial discovery and how not to do that. So diving in a little bit, you know, most reps have, used MEDDIC or BANT or some sort of qualification process. I think the issue with this is they often don't focus on what really matters. They go too deep into the methodology and too little into what actually matters in the deal, at least early on. So they're not asking who you talking with. They're not understanding what the business does, and they're not, you know, seeking out why did they come to your company in the first place. I think a really good example of this is I was at a QBR in Twilio once, and a rep had to all these qualifications had mapped out the org structure, but they really couldn't answer the question of how does this business that they're selling into make money? And why would the product or why would Twilio at that point matter to the company, and why would they buy the product? And so understanding that is really gonna help you excel and also help you map to what the, right motivation behind the conversation might be. Love it. What's number two? Number two is something I like to call a two four six eight pipeline, and it's about why you should build it and why it should have it. Essentially, what a two four six eight pipeline means is that you're matching your deal sizes or a number of deals to make sure you have, always have the right pipeline coverage. So take, for example, $250,000 quota on a quarterly basis. You'd have two deals that are a 125 k, four deals that are 62 and a half, and so on and so forth. Each of those numbers adds up in its own right $2.02 50. So, essentially, you have three to four x pipeline coverage. The way that it works, though, is that in practice, as a rep, you could close two deals at a 125 to make your quota. You could close all four to make your quota, or you can close a combination of those deal cycles. But the great thing is that if, let's say, your two banger deals fall out, you still have a four, six, and eight to close. And as you close these deals, you replace it with another deal. So quarter over quarter, month over month, you always have something to close that you're working on at different types of velocity to enable you to feel really confident and to derisk your, overall pipeline and overall, quota attainment. Beautiful. Rout us out, Andrew. What's number three? Last one. Again, near and dear to my heart because I I come from Superhuman, and that is to follow-up faster. So I think one thing that a lot of reps aren't doing well enough is that, sure, as as they are doing their follow ups post call, that matters. But, you know, they're not leaning in as the customer is leaning in. And so our Pro Tipu tools don't help us do that today. And so one thing that I really wanna highlight is how can you be not your own worst enemy? And so as a customer is leaning into responding and working with you, you're following in suit, responding very quickly. It can make you stand out, especially if you're in a competitive situation where maybe the customer is leaning in, they're evaluating two or three different solutions, you being one of them. If someone else is responding faster, being more proactive, being more attentive, they're gonna get more attention from that end customer. Don't let your competition beat you out in that way. And so follow-up faster, follow-up on time, and lean in and follow suit with, like, your customer's operating. So, Andrew, it's been a minute since we've had someone who comes from, like, a true purebred PLG company, and Superhuman is absolutely that. So if you guys don't know what Superhuman does, fastest email client in the world. I love it. Let's say you pick up an account and you see there are three or four people on the account who actively use Superhuman. What do you do? Our typical motion is we're monitoring those signals. So we use a tool internally called Pocus, and Pocus gives us insight into what those companies' metrics are. So for example, Arman, if you're using I can see how many email you've sent, how many sessions you have. And we have different criteria for what we call engaged, active users, and then what we call super users. And so we identify first what level are they in, and then we might have a prescriptive approach to work with them. So let's say they're more mediocre, but the domain is really good. So for lack of better choice, it's apple.com, and there's three users inside Apple. I might then go look at and say, how can we coach them? How can we earn the right to have a sales conversation? So we might bring resources or our CES and delight team to help coach them up on how to get to that super engaged level, which then will give them a great experience and, hopefully, that opens the door for a sales conversation. If, let's say, they're already super engaged, like, let's say, it's two or three sales users inside, again, great domain, we might use their activity and their success in Superhuman and probably their fanboyness or fangirlness of Superhuman to play into, okay, you've been super successful. What would it look like if we got your team on on the product? And can you imagine a world where not just you are living this life, but the rest of your team is? And how much better are they gonna interact with externally with customers or in turn with other stakeholders? You said that the type of company that it is dictates the way that you're reaching out, and I'm wondering if you can tell me a little more about that. Yeah. So we're trying to always fit into our ICT, right, and look at not only what the buyer persona is. So are they someone who likely receives a lot of email, but, also, are they a company where they might benefit from this agreement? We look for companies that, like, a b to b SaaS company, like my former employer, Twilio, where they're working externally with a lot of customers, they have a high volume of email, and then following up faster going on to my last point could enable them to be a better resource and use less tooling. So we look really look at the domain. Like, is that domain the right type of company that we wanna work with? Professional service is another one that works really well. High volume of email, high need to respond to customers, and then high importance, obviously. They're they're working with these clients that, typically have a a lot of money that they're paying these these companies. This is super interesting. So let's say that you have two apple.coms. Right? Someone made the carbon copy of Apple somehow, and one organization has people in engineering, sales, support, all over the place. Right? And then another has a bunch of people clustered in one department. Do you prefer to have it all clustered in one segment, or do you prefer to have it peanut buttered across the org? It depends on where we're at, but I would likely go after the one where it's all in one department, and I'll tell you why. Especially if it's in a department where it's customer facing, we know the impact, we'll look at that. We call it a pre post. We can look at their their impact using Superhuman with real metrics around how many emails are they sending from when they first onboarded to now, how much more responsive are they? But most importantly, you're probably saving time. We actually also capture that time savings. And so I could say your sales department, for example, is disaffective, and that could mean you're closing more deals, you're responding to customers faster, a number of different ways. When it's peanut butter spread across, it's a good way to consolidate the account. So one of our first motions that we do is we say, hey, Nick. You're in IT. Arman, you're in customer success. Maybe there's four or five other people who are using the product. And what I might say is, alright. Let's get you all on the same bill, like, so we at least can get you on a team. And then we'll figure out which of those people has the best metrics and which of those people leans into Superhuman the most and might be our expansion point to get Superhuman on their team or at least run an experiment or a trial. That's so smart. You kept Armand out of IT because you knew he was gonna cause some sort of security breach at my company and screw something up. So I love that you're thinking about that way. But, actually, what I think is really smart is you've got two users who are paying for your product but in separate departments. And one of the reasons to engage them is like, yo. You both work at the same company. Shouldn't we at least consolidate your billing? And that's an awesome way to engage them. So, Andrew, I'm curious. I I personally use Superhuman even before you guys sponsored us, and I can't imagine there's a deal where you can all of a sudden take 29,000 people who were using Gmail, and all of a sudden, everyone is using Superhuman all at once. I can already see Nick being triggered because he was on Outlook until a year ago. Alright? And so let's assume that you're starting at the top. You're starting with, like, a founder esque or maybe, like, a VP of sales, someone high who has control over one or a couple departments. How do you chomp this thing up? Do you try to win, like, a small lot and then get a bigger lot? Do you do a pilot and then a bigger pilot? How do you, like, cut up into digestible pieces? A mysterious phrase from Oliver j calls it seed, land, expand. He was the former CRO of Enesana. He taught me and so this idea of, like, you see the deal. Right? You get a couple people on it. You get them consolidated on the same billing, could be in that department. And then you land it to land a larger this section. So it might be a single team, a single sales team, but not the whole org, and then you expand it from there. So then it might be the entire sales organization, and then you're looking at expanding across departments. I have found that creates the best opportunity to show the metrics and show the ROI and create these impact moments over time versus I'm gonna go sell you a 30,000 seat deal. Someone signs off on it, and then you hit halfway through the contract, and there's an adoption problem. And, certainly, we face that ourselves too. Right? But I think as you can land in good really high adoption or really high activation, it lends itself to that expansion conversation that much more. When you go ask somebody else, you say, hey. Your team's crushing it on superhuman. Can I have an intro to your VP of customer success? Let's see what we can do for their team. How do you coach your reps to think about that between not biting off more than they can chew, but also not being too passive and saying, well, let's just start with three people when it's selling to Apple. It's a good question. We do have a minimum threshold. So, like, we won't sign a team contract below 10 seats. So that enables, like, us to have a a certain cutoff level, which is helpful. I also think about it, you know, in different motions or different segments. So enterprise, I want the logo. Like, get what you can land on the organization because that matters and get someone who's really effective versus a faster velocity mid market SMB deal. Land as many seats as you can, but don't push it. Right? Get the land. When I think about that two four six eight, the reps today, it said, Superhuman have a hybrid motion. So we don't have the donation between AMs and AEs just yet, which actually lends itself well because you can say your expansion deals often end up being your two and four deals because it's the deals you prior closed you're trying to really expand. And your eight deals might be your fast moving, I'm gonna get a bunch of lands in that might expand one to two quarters out from now. And so it's kind of this kind of iteration, so it works really well in the hybrid model. So I was advising a founder the other day who also has a PLG motion. And I think Superhuman is one of those things that really lends itself to, like, you trying it first. But with him, one of the things that we were struggling with is, I would say, half of the deals, you can push a prospect over the line without a pilot, right, without actually getting to try it. Everyone will ask, though. And then the other half, it's like, if you don't give them that pilot, it's just it doesn't feel real to them. They can't get their head around the adoption, and then you end up losing the deal, or you have to walk it back and come back to the pilot, and that just puts a bad taste in everyone's mouth. And so for you, let's say you get in front of someone. Are there situations where, a, you're like, this deal can go all the way through without a pilot? Or, b, you're like, the pilot is needed to slow this thing down. How do you decide between those two paths? I would say the deal where we're trying to go after, like, a 30,000 seat size of prize, you know, that might take several years. That's where a pilot's necessary, especially upfront to land that first contract. Because I found it enables us to as you might know, we onboard people individually or in small groups. And so we create this really great one to one onboarding experience. What I don't want to happen is for people not to miss that because we've found that if they don't activate on Superhuman or do certain sets of actions within the first five days of using it, it doesn't resonate and they're not going to continue using Superhuman. And so, I would rather control that upfront so that when we come time, like, we might successively increase the pilot size so that once we come time to landing the large deal, the activation and adoption of the product is is high, then it lends itself or whatever committee or whoever we're talking to say, yes, I'm gonna make the investment org wide or or a good subset of org wide into Superhuman. Are there things that you're doing before you start a pilot or a POC, like setting success criteria or setting up a shared Slack channel, etcetera? Are there things that you're doing with intention to make sure that the POC is gonna go well and it actually turns into closed business or at least gives you the best chance of being able to do that? Shared Slack channel is one. We try to do that as much as we can, although, you know, it's always something that you have to issue doesn't get too unwieldy, especially as you get more and more folks internally and externally into it, giving product feedback, turning into a support channel. So we do do that success criteria for sure. A big one is, like, what is the success metric that would give us the green light to go? Is that timing and usage of product? Is that adoption of number of seats that we allocate? Is that activation of those seats? So we figure out what thing they care about the most, and then we try to coach them on what are the benchmarks that we see across other SaaS tools. And And then also what are the benchmarks we see typically across superhuman users. So they can know like, okay, if I have Slack, I should expect this or some other tool. If I have superhuman, I might expect this. And this is what other people are using who are coming from maybe a Gmail background or an Outlook background. So just to clarify, what you're doing when you set the success criteria is you're trying to figure out what matters to the customer. What lane are we playing in for success? And then you're saying based upon that metric, here's what other companies have in terms of what their adoption is, for example. And so what I might do for thirty minutes to presidents club, if the customer says, oh, we're focused on webinar leads, I might say, great. Okay. Here's where we land. Here's where competitor a, b, and c lands just so you have a benchmark sense in terms of what you might expect. I guess that it doesn't even need to be competitors. It might be other programs where they're getting leads of that nature. Yeah? That's right. And one company might care about if your work was selling to a sales team, their productivity by rep. Very common theme in today's market. You know what's happening with cost cutting. And productivity by rep for them might be is Superhuman allowing each rep to respond to more emails or more customers? Right? That's what it nets out to. Another company might say, hey. I'm buying Superhuman because everyone's stressed out, and I wanna see if they're getting the inbox here. Is it making their lives happier? Very different metrics. We can measure both, but one is gonna be very ROI focused. One is focused on, like, are they hitting inbox zero? Are they using Superhuman a lot? Do they feel better? Like, do we run a survey or a satisfaction thing? And we we give that back to them. So we can then orient around what the customer wants a lot better knowing that success criteria going into it. The reason this is so important is the other day someone was like, yeah. You know what? I just wanna get them on the pilot so that the product like, the product's gonna do the work. The product's gotta sell them. And I'm like, the product cannot solve for the fact that oftentimes a prospect doesn't even know what they wanna buy. Right? Or they won't know without success criteria how they're gonna justify this thing to their CFO. And so the worst case thing you can do by having good success criteria is you can make yourself realize that a pilot should never make sense in the first place because their expectations are massively unreasonable or they haven't even thought for two seconds around what it would take for them to buy. Right? So it allows you to slow down so you don't waste your own time. I think there's a really important factor of a lot of people think, do I make a pilot or a POC free? And I think it should always be paid. We used to do this thing at Scale AI. We called it a quick hit. So how can you get a quick validation point that would be free? But we're talking, like, a day or two. But if it was a pilot, anything longer than a week, you're paying for it. And the reason you we we did that, which is pretty obvious, is just that it creates an ownership on both sides of the coin of now I'm paying that nothing. I'm paying for it at list price. We charge our customers list price for pilots typically so that they feel like they can come to the table and that there's a risk on both sides. Right? I'm now paying for maybe it's a 100 seats. Maybe it's a large potential opportunity. I'm paying a good chunk of change to try Superhuman. I should be invested in what that success looks like and working with the Superhuman team just as our sales team and our product team should be delivering on what we have agreed upon in that success metric. How do you voice that over to the customer? Because I bet they show up and they're like, oh, I wanna do a pilot of this thing, and they're expecting it to be free. And I have to imagine you have to explain it in a sort of delicate way, like, no. You need to write a check for this. I would say we try everything to scope it down. Certainly, that comes up, and certainly, we're not totally against it within the right understanding and scope. But I would say, maybe they're saying, I wanna try it for a 100 users or 50 users, and we try to push a PayPal. I'll say, let's try it for 10. Right? Let's try it for five. Let's get a a quicker validation. Maybe we'll give that piece for a free because it doesn't matter as much, and we'll show you what the promised land looks like versus you paying for it upfront if that's the thing. Like, let's just take that away. Clearly, the cost and the number of seats is the problem here. Let's move into a different bucket. One more question. So VP of sales comes in. They're like, let's do a pilot for my whole sales organization. You respond and say, no. Let's do it for 10 people. Let's show what the promised land looks like. How do you decide who those 10 people in the 100 person sales org should be that are piloting it? It's a good question. It's one that I think we're constantly iterating on. I would say, user can pick two metrics. One is you pick the most the highest volume email users and see, like, how more effective they come. One thing that we also can look at is who are the slowest responders. So, like, who is responding slowest to prospects inside Gmail, for example? And then can we have a bigger improvement with them using Superhuman? I like that metric or finding those users. Like, people who are painters and say, you know what? Nick, I'm terrible at email. I know that I don't get back to customers in two or three days. Give me Superhuman. Let's see if it makes me better. I actually think that tells the case better than someone who's like, I already tried to operate towards inbox zero. Certainly, the gains might be better, but you're not gonna see this massive jump, which is we wanna tell that story. Right? We wanna say, it makes everyone superhuman. Everyone should be using superhuman as a product. And if you're not, you're missing out on the equation of being, like, a best in class sales rep, for example. How how long are you running a pilot for? They vary. So, usually, I would say it's about a month, but we've had some that runs six months. Gotcha. So let's say you have a pilot that runs a month, and then you still got, like, legal security, all these other things that financial approval, all these things. Are you parallel processing some of the vendor of your review process? Are you trying to get that stuff done beforehand so you're not, like, done with the pilot and then you have to do three months of vendor diligence and whatnot? How do you manage all of the other stuff in addition to the pilot that is required to get a signature on paper? I always coach reps. I think my favorite d is decision process in medic because I think there's so much that can go wrong. And we've all been there, sales rep, sales manager, CRO, where the best deal of the quarter has fallen through three days before, and now it's pushing to the following quarter. And I think that a lot of times comes down to, not always, but comes down to, did you get ahead of the decision process and the decision criteria? And do you know all the different steps? And so I think it's really important that we try to do it as in parallel as possible, especially in a longer pilot where there's gonna be a much larger engagement. We wanna get ahead of what are the compliance risks? Are we running through any product gaps that we need to have before GA launch? Are you working with our lawyer? Are we going to contracts that's prenegotiated? I wanna get to the end of the pilot, and my goal is to say or the company to say, green light, let's go on on Superhuman or whatever product you're selling. And then at that point, it only takes two or three days to get the deal closed. Like, you've mapped everything. They say a red light or yellow light. Okay. That usually should then be associated to the actual pilot. What did we not solve for, or what did we miss the mark on? It shouldn't be because of, like, a paper process issue that you ran into because you just were lazy and didn't do it. I think that's what it comes down to. So good. Last thing before we jump, magic moments. Nick and I were actually just talking about this in the context of thirty minutes to presidents club sponsorships, where we want people when they get live to have everything from their content to go live, to have their guest on the show, to do the webinar with them, and we wanna plan those things early so that they feel the benefits right after they sign the contract. And so oftentimes, there's this rush when we sign a customer to get them live. For you, can you talk about what are those magic moments that you're planning, and how are you orchestrating this over the month of a pilot? The biggest one for a pilot that we do is we have this delight team. Delight is actually a core value, like create delight at Superhuman as a core value. And one thing that we found that I think Superhuman was one of the early pioneers in is the onboarding experience, which we will do one to one. We have now done more like one to many groups because at Superhuman scale, it's harder to do that. But we create a very, like, VIP personal experience, and we open that up. These people are very well trained, And they take you through and they say, let me, like, be your email coach. And you're like, I didn't know I needed an email coach. And it creates this really amazing thing of people who are sitting there with 10,000 emails. They've got the little icon on their phone or on their computer. It's, like, 10,000 unread, and they go to zero, and they get to zero in thirty minutes with this email coach. It is a very elated experience. So that's one thing. It's, like, get them to see the power of the product upfront, you know, within the first five days of onboarding. There are certainly also things in the product that help with that, but focusing on the sales emotions here. The second one is we try to do weekly check ins. And those weekly check ins are could be something a coaching session about a new feature. Like, maybe it's in the sales team. We're making sure they really understand how the product works. We try to understand, like, gaps. We can monitor usage. Like, we see that you're triaging emails, but you're not sending emails. Like, we we try to take a metrics driven approach to really tailor that experience towards the customer so that they feel like we see them, and also we're hearing them whenever we talk to them. So that's really important. The one thing that I'll add is and this is kind of post pilot, but I don't think I think about this for expansion. One thing that we're starting to do with customers now as we move back to an in person world is we talked about earlier, you land a small team and you wanna go for expansion. We just landed a a small team inside a very great great organization. Unfortunately, I can't say the name, but we're actually offered to go on-site. We're bringing them lunch, and we're gonna do a superhuman training session for the people who have it. We're also gonna bring swag for just the people who attend that session. And it's gonna be custom swag for that. And so, like, people are gonna see superhuman all over. We're inviting people to come in. And so we're almost creating the viral loop as an in person viral re in addition to what the product has. So, you know, it's just sent from Superhuman on the bottom of the email. And so we do those certain things like that. But we're trying to create this delightful experience, both in person, virtual, and then every time we interact with the customer. I just have one more question. And you talked about the email coach thing. And I know there's a lot of salespeople listening to this episode being like, I have zero control over my inbox. And I'm sure you've seen a lot of best and worst practices as it relates to how salespeople manage their email, and I'm wondering if you could share some of those. I'm gonna go with the superhuman methodology because that's what I believe, and that's what I I now feel strongly about. Essentially, give every email a job. Right? A lot of people use the methodology of, I'm gonna unread an email. I'm gonna start. I'm gonna fall back to it later. What happens is you just clutter your inbox, and you're like, what in the hell do I have to do now? Like, you get to the end of your day, like, I had 15 calls or whatever how many calls. Who do I follow-up with first? What do I respond to? Whenever you have fifteen minutes, you should be triaging or whenever you have time. And what I mean by that is it's either marking done, you're reminding it for later, or you're responding to it now. And the way that we view it at superhuman is, like, if you can respond to that email in less than five minutes, get it out of the way. If it's gonna take later, it's just something for your knowledge, mark it done. And then if you need to spend more time with it, remind it at a time, set aside a block an hour at the end of your day for those emails that may take more crafting. And what that will enable you to do is you clear your inbox, and then everything resurfaces, again, this is a superhuman feature. Later during that hour, and then you can prioritize at that point in time and go through them. But it creates, like, this wellness of I'm not missing anything, and everything that I need to respond to is either scheduled, done, or I don't care about it and it's out of my way and it's not cluttering my brain. Boom. I love it. Andrew, thank you for joining us. Gotta move to the final question because we're running out of time. And the final question is this. We've talked about great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? It might be an obvious one. Reiterating is overtalking on anything. And I think one thing that I've learned from other leaders, from other really great reps, is their ability to listen and speak last on a call, and then also not be afraid to ask a tough question based on what they've heard. And it's only that you when you listen intently and are the last to speak, can you really drive a question home that has enough insight and enough power that the customer is like, wow. I I've never thought about that. If you wanna dive into it, there's a great podcast with Peter Reinhart who who built Segment, which was acquired by Twilio. And he talks about the first time he was in a room, and he brought in his first enterprise rep. And they had to push to get a larger deal size, and he was afraid to do it. And his enterprise rep was deeply concerned, asked all these seemingly dumb questions, but really understood the customer. So listen, ask questions intently. I think a lot of people are just getting so gun heavy of, like, trying to jump on what they wanna get to. They're they have too many agenda set. They're not leaning back enough. Love it. Andrew, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode with Andrew Johnston. Number one, do not enter a pilot or a POC without setting clear success criteria with your customer. If you don't have exit criteria for what's gonna make them sign the big contract at the end of the POC, you're in trouble because you might do a whole POC and then realize that they have not given any thought to how they're actually gonna turn this one into a deal. Number two, as it relates to that success criteria, the way that you should think about presenting is, one, figure out what matters to your customer. What vertical are they looking at in terms of what metric matters? And then don't just ask them, well, what do you think is good? Instead, you should present benchmarks based upon comparable tools. So what Andrew will do is he'll say, hey. This is what Slack sees in terms of usage. Here's what you should expect from Superhuman. And you use that as the barometer, not a number that your customer just pulls out of their back pocket. Number three. If we go all the way back to prospecting, break your accounts, your prospects, the people who are using your product into high usage and low usage. For the lower usage group, your goal is to coach them up. See if you can help get them using the product more, introduce them to your success team, etcetera. For the high usage group, you just reach out and you say, hey. How can we get this in the hands of other people? And the sale will start to roll. And then lastly, number four. If you find four people in the organization, but they're all in different departments, the easiest way to reach out to them is to consolidate their bill for them. But if you find four people in the same department, you can consolidate the team. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Well, Armon, I heard that you were feeling generous. And I was looking at the show notes for this episode, and I saw that you were so kind as to be giving away a free month of Superhuman for anybody who wants to try it. So, folks, I am serious. Arman did respond to me in a decently timely fashion before via email. But now, Arman, I've been monitoring you, monitoring you. I've been watching you, watching you. I've seen your stress levels around email go down pretty dramatically, and you are actually responding in a far more intelligent and timely way. Not that you weren't that bad in the past, and so I think Superhuman plays a big part in that. So, folks, I really recommend you check it out. There's a link in the show notes. Get your first month for free, and we'll see you next week on the show. Show.
