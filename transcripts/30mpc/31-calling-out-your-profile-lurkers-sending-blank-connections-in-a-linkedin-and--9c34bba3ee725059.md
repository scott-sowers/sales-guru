## Transcript

Good morning, everybody. And welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my co host Nick Sigelski, and we have, again, our first two time champion of 30 MPC, Morgan Ingram of J Barrows Consulting. Why should people listen again? Well, Morgan takes us through systems, process, LinkedIn sales nav, Outreach, SalesLoft, and how to use technology to sell more. You gotta listen. Three, two, one, technology. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kind of where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Morgan. Welcome to the show. You know, we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. So number one is when you're on LinkedIn and you're looking to prospect someone, go to their profile and click the see all button if you're a first or second degree connected to them, and allows you to not only see what they've been posting, but what they've been liking and commenting on, and you can use that in your outreach. Cool. What's number two? Alright. So number two is we're gonna go to LinkedIn sales navigator here, and this one this one is critical. Like, if you do this, you're gonna be way ahead of the game, is go inside of your LinkedIn sales navigator list. And if you're an SDR, create a list of all the meetings you scheduled throughout your career. And if you're an AE, make a list of all the meetings that you scheduled and also all the meetings that you've closed as well. And so now you have a pipeline of people you can reach out to in the future and ask for referrals. Nice. Round us out. What's the last one, Morgan? Alright. So last one. I know a lot of people out here are using a sales offer on Outreach. If you're using something outside of that, I can't really help you there, but this should be in there, which is you wanna star your contacts. And if you go inside of sales offer, again, Outreach or get another system normally, they have a star button, star that contact. And what you're doing there is you wanna use that for direct dials so that you're not just going through phone trees so that you could be way more actionable and tactical in your calls. So I see a lot of people talk about, like, creating these lists in Sales Nav. And some people do a great job of creating lists, but then they have this massive feed of just nonsense that comes their way. So do you have any way of time blocking or programmatically saying, hey. Once a week, I'm gonna go after everybody that I've ever sold to and ask for referrals? Like, how do you actually do that? Yeah. So when you're going about and creating the list, I would say at the end of every month, create a dedicated time to go do that. So maybe it's an hour on a Friday. Right? Most people aren't doing that much on a Friday, so this is a perfect time to get this done and go in to be like, alright. Let me go look at the CRM. Who did I close this month? Who did I schedule this month? Maybe what did my STR if you're an AE schedule this month? Right? So you could start building this list. Throughout the week, what you wanna do is once a week, thirty minute time slot to look through your list to then decide. Normally, you wanna do this on a Monday. I normally have them as admin days to then make a decision to be like, okay. I'm gonna go ahead and prospect these people. I'm gonna ask for referrals. And this should be a simple setup because you should have formulas already set up for, like, your referrals and things of that nature. So that's how you set it up to make sure that you're successful in building this list. And so how do you do a little bit of give get with your referrals? Let's say I have time blocked it. I've identified some people I wanna go after. Are you just, like, blasting people saying, like, hey. You got any business? You got any business? Like, how do you do that artfully and tactfully? So what I'm doing is I'm going to the contact on LinkedIn. And in LinkedIn sales navigator, as long as their connections aren't closed, you should be able to see all the people they're connected to. So what you're gonna do is inside of that search is you're gonna type in the job titles that you'd be looking to go for. So for me, I'm looking for an enablement person, a CRO, a VP of sales, a sales development leader. And then I'm just gonna pick two or three people. That's it. And I'm gonna do a simple reach out like this. Hope all is well and that your team is still going strong based on the last training that we did. Quick ask for you. Do you know x, y, and z? And then I have those hyperlinked to their LinkedIn so they can easily check it. The ask here, though, is important. If not, do you know anyone else like minded like yourself that I should be connected with? Cheers. That's it. And so what I'm doing there is I'm saying like minded like you. Maybe they don't know those three people, but they're like, you know what? Sally, you wanna talk to her because she's looking to build out a team and she needs training right now. So I'm getting a response regardless, and I'm setting myself up for a success. And that isn't super pushy. I've done the work on my end, and I also I could connect with someone like minded and maybe they don't want sales training, but maybe it's someone I could connect with that could get me on another referral down the line. So I'm always building that network there. I got a question for you about InMails on LinkedIn because I've got LinkedIn Sales Nav, and I've got this allocation of InMail that I can send every single month. And I end up not really using them because I don't wanna go straight to the pitch. And so I'm curious. How are you using your InMails? Are you just treating it like email and blasting stuff out there? My main suggestion is send people case studies that are in their industry. Hey. We recently had a case study that came out that has been helping people increase their pipeline velocity by 30% in the baking industry, and I wanted to send it to you. Would you be open to checking that out? Yeah, Morgan. I will. And the thing is when you send an InMail and someone responds, you get the credits back. So the thing is is that all I wanna do is get a response. Because once the DM's open, the DM's open. Right? So then I could send whatever. The thing though is that I'm locked until they respond. So, no, I'm not gonna do a normal email format here because we've AB tested it and we've saw that the email was higher. So do your normal email flow. The InMail, the focus should be here is I wanna give them something. They respond. I get my credit back. Now I can have my normal messaging and do what I need to do from there to get the meeting. So I've seen some people do the InMail first. Some people do a connection request first. Some people personalize the connection request. Other people leave it blank. Do you have a perspective on how you mix in both connections and InMails? So this is gonna shock a lot of people is that the blank note has a higher acceptance rate than the personalized note. Now I'm gonna get to the InMail, but this is an important point before we get there. You can withdraw your connection request. A lot of people don't know that you could withdraw these. So just because you sent this one out doesn't mean that the game's over. You still have an opportunity here. So how do you do that? So you go to your LinkedIn. You go to the my network, the two little people there. Then you click see all. And then when you click see all, you can click sent. And then inside of sent, you can withdraw all these connection requests. Now LinkedIn says that you have to wait three weeks to reconnect. We found that that to be false completely. So I think there's a bug there's a bug in the system. So I'm just gonna let y'all know right now. I I've been able to finesse it a little bit. And so normally, we'll send it probably, like, a couple days later, and we'll send, like, a personalized note because they didn't accept the blank note. So you can really maximize your connection request because here's the thing. You wanna get the connection request because you guys heard me talk about it on the first time it was on here, which is the LinkedIn video. You wanna have that because that's gonna be a high response rate. Then if the connection request doesn't work, I will send an InMail later in my campaign to see if I can get that open, right, or that response essentially and get my credits back. I love this, man. So we've talked about the connections. We've talked about you going out. What about people coming in? I I didn't you have some funny tactics around, like, when people look at your profile, you do something you send them, like, some funky message every time? Yes. So well and it it depends on how many views you're getting, but this is a a unique tactic you can do. So if they're first degree connected or even second degree connected I actually actually did it this morning. I got a couple people to reply to it. So I messaged them, and I go to the GIF or the GIF or whatever you wanna call it, and I type in lurk. And there's a deer or a llama. Actually, we haven't determined what it is, but I'm pretty sure it's a llama. And it's like you know what you wanna talk about? And it comes, like, out of the rock and it goes back in. So I I click that one, and then, like, let's say if Arman viewed my profile, I'd be like, hi, Arman. I saw you viewed my profile. Quick question. Did I do something wrong? And people just crack up. They're like, no. You didn't do anything wrong at all. And that leads it sometimes into meetings. They're like, yeah. I was actually looking to talk to you about training, or I actually saw your email or whatever. So it get it gets a good laugh, and it's just it's just super cool to do. You could obviously do another GIF or GIF if you want to. You could also do a voice message on that too, but I I found that's my llama. That's my go to right there. I love it because your ask is, like, kind of so far out there where it's like, hey. I did something really wrong. Of course, you didn't. They looked at your profile, and it it's actually causing them to to respond. It's kinda like it's almost similar to the humbling disclaimer that we talk about where if you're suggesting you're something that's like, would this be the absolute worst idea in the history of Earth? Of course not. Of course, they didn't do anything wrong. Alright. So we spent a lot of time on on LinkedIn here. I know you have some really interesting things you do with SalesLoft, Outreach, and some of these sales engagement tools. So what goal do you have for me here, Morgan? Yeah. So what I tell people is that really dive into your templates and your snippets. I think a lot of times people don't leverage these as much. So I encourage everyone when you listen to this podcast episode to spend half a day to create all the templates of all the personas and the industries that you're going after. Could be a lot for some of you, could not be a lot for some of you, but just think about that. Right? Then come up with templates for certain trigger points. And so what I mean by that is when I see on a website that someone's hiring SDRs, I already have a template for that. I have a template if someone has a merger and acquisition. I have a template if they're looking to hire AEs. I'm already prepared, and the thing is this saves me time. So the more templates I have, the better. Snippets are for call to actions and value props. So when you're looking to personalize at scale or whatever you're calling it over there, right, what you wanna focus on is having snippets of value props, snippets of call to actions. So now the only thing you have to focus on is the first three sentences of that email. So now it's just snippet. That's my value prop. Snippet, that's my call to action. You don't wanna spend time typing out these things. They should already be inside of your sales engagement tool so that you're preparing yourself for very fast and effective messaging across the board. A lot of people screw this up. And just to clarify for the audience, if you don't have snippets or templates or any of that stuff, a template is a fully prewritten out email, and a snippet is a couple of prewritten out sentences that you can insert into an existing message. And a lot of people, we tend to think so highly of ourselves, and we tend to think like, man, like, I've gotta craft that email every single time, or a robot could never write an email, or you can never do personalization at scale, and you are completely wrong. In your brain, you have a massive if this then that statement. If I see they raised a round, then this. If I see they've gone to the same college, then this. And I have the best reps who would have 30 snippets that literally are just putting puzzle pieces together. And it sounds like that's what you're doing at scale. So one thing I wanna add here because I don't have a sales engagement tool like an Outreach or SalesLoft. And so even if you don't have one of these, there's a tool. It's a free add in in Outlook. It's called quick parts. And so what you can do is you can highlight text and actually turn it into a snippet. So if I type the word Armond into an Outlook message, it looks like a text expander. I hit the word enter, and it turns into my Armond template. And so on that point of templates, I think we're pretty big on the eighty twenty rule here where, like, if you're gonna do something just one time and it's a really custom thing, okay, maybe you don't turn that into a snippet. But if you're doing something repeatedly, you do. So how do you strike that balance? When do you what what triggers go off in your head where it's like, oh, this is something I'm gonna reuse? Think about all the objections that you get in emails. Like, not interested, reach out six months, I don't have budget. Every single time you see that, you probably struggle with it or you probably are like, you know, I've seen this before. Maybe some of you out there already know what to do. And for those who already know what to do, they already have an answer. But the thing is instead of typing it out every single time, why not put that in the ATEX? I remember as a team, we had an answer for every single objection, like, every single thing on LinkedIn. We had a thing for every single connection request, and you could do that. And it's all just a system because once you've seen that it works, now we include it. So, Nick, to answer that question, all my templates and snippets are based off of things that I see continuously in these accounts or challenges or priorities that keep coming out of the mouths of my clients. So I need to create a template for that because it keeps coming up. Why would I not do that? And have you gotten creative? We just had Jeremy Levier on, and he talks about using GIFs and all these other fun, like, crazy images, videos of him playing the guitar wrong. Have have you experimented with that, or are you more of, like, a plain text guy? So when someone's not replying to something or I send a video and I don't get a reply, I use GIFs and GIFs on LinkedIn and in my InMails and my emails to get reply backs. So I use that strategically across the board. I even use memes of, like, put stuff like I'll, like, put my face on certain things. Like, that's the way that I go about being creative because that's the way that I think in GIFs, GIFs, memes in terms of my follow-up. Because if I'm gonna follow-up, I at least want them to laugh about it. So if they laugh, that means that there's a chance that I can get a response here. I like that Atex tool thing you're using, and it sounds like you're you're pulling in all sorts of creative ways to be more efficient with your time. And so I'm curious what other pieces of technology are you pulling into your day to day? Yeah. So this is a tool that most of you probably never heard of before. It's called Clockify. I love this tool, and here's why. Because I track how long each task take. Most reps say, I don't have any time. I don't know what's going on on my day. Well, okay. Well, track it and figure out what is actually happening. I know how long it takes me to make a video. I know how long it takes me to do email. I know how long it takes me to reply to notifications on LinkedIn. I know how long it takes me to prep for a call. I know how long it takes me to send videos on my email for email objections. Like, I know how long these things take me. So I get way more done in a day than most people because I know how long my tasks take. When you don't know how long your tasks take, you overthink it, paralysis analysis, and you don't get as much done as you think that you do. So Clockify is fantastic or any type of time management tool. You can use your phone, but I like just using it on the desktop because I can name the task. And then so I can be like LinkedIn notifications. Start. Go after. Okay. That took me forty five minutes. Now now I know it took me forty five minutes to go through 99 plus notifications. Right? Or okay. Video? How long does it take me to make 20 videos? An hour? Okay. Now I know if I block off an hour, I can get 20 videos done. If my conversion rate is 10%, okay, I could get two replies, and I know those replies normally lead into meetings. That's two meetings. So the thing is, like, I'm getting so granular in how I do my tasks that I know what I need to get done every single day, and no one can take that time away from me because I know what that time means to me. And so Clockify is how I manage those different tasks so I can be on top of everything I'm doing. So, Morgan, actually, on that point, one of the things I'm interested in is Arman and I are really big in the way that you structure your day and how that sets you up for success. And so I'm curious. Sounds like you're being really methodical about where you spend your time. What's the structure of your day look like in terms of when you're stacking tasks, meetings, etcetera? So on Sunday, I look at the week, and I'm like, alright. So I have these tasks I need to do. I have these tasks I need to do. What's important? What's the pipeline look like? And the easiest way to set this up to know what you need to get done is separate it into three colors. Green, yellow, and red. Green is my favorite one, is money making activities. Alright. So this is this is the key one. Alright? So I always tell people if you don't have a lot of greens on your calendar, you're in trouble. Period. That means, like, you are not driving towards quota. You need to figure that out. Right? So what are money making activities? That's discovery calls, cold calls, personalized emails that you're sending out, doing videos, things of that nature. Like, these are tasks that lead to you getting quota, right, and you're making money. Two, right, yellow is prepping for money making activities. So that's social listening, doing research, all the things that we had talked about, building list. Right? That's a yellow. And then red is the break. So I take breaks between the greens and the yellows so I can get myself in a mood to do task switching. On a more granular level, I have you can do this if you want to. This is my insane part of the brain, but I have music playlist for each one of those tasks. So I have a music playlist for cold calling blitz. I have a music playlist before I do videos. I have a music playlist when I'm answering notifications and also doing emails. Like, I have playlist for that because it helps me task switch and be way more productive as well. So I wanna go back to this outreach and sales left thing because there are a ton of super powerful tools that you can use within that tool. So we talked about reporting. Is there anything that you have from a reporting or insight standpoint that people underutilize inside of Outreach or SalesLoft? So inside of SalesLoft, I know that they have Aller. And I encourage people to use Aller in there because it's so great. Because if you schedule a meeting with x company, immediately, this is what you should do, is because inside of SalesLoft, there's Aller, you can see what the competitors are. So if that company is interested, probably their competitors are too. So I would do that all the time. I'm like, cool. Let me just rack up a new list of now these competitors I can reach out to, and you can continuously build off this competitor list. I schedule a good amount of meetings just by scheduling a meeting, looking at the competitors inside SalesLoft, go creating a whole new list, getting touch on those accounts, and now reaching out. This is a very simple flow that you can start doing right inside of there. I also know LinkedIn sales navigator's inside of there too, so that's an easy way that you could send out connection requests as your first touch and not even have to go on LinkedIn. Right? You're doing it all within the sales engagement tool. So those are two tools inside of I know SalesLoft that you can start leveraging to get some results. And so you talked about list building here and, like, using our to hop from one company to another to another. One thing I see SDRs and AE struggle with a lot is you'll put 50 folks in a sequence, and then you'll go and look at your account list of 300 accounts, and half of them are in sequence and half of them aren't. And so you're you you start to get lost in your workflow where you're like, shoot. Did I sequence that? Did I not sequence it? And people end up spending hours, like, combing through their account list trying to figure out what they've worked and what they haven't. So do you have any recommendations from, like, a workflow standpoint to stay on top of your account book? Yeah. So there's two things that you could be doing here. One is when you get all of your accounts, if you feel overwhelmed, put them this is aggressive, but this will work. Put them all inside of your sequence as step one and just call it clean data. So instead of just putting them in one by one by one and being confused, dump them all into the sequence and just call it step one, like I just said, clean data. And then you can naturally put people through the sequence in day two, which would then be your email, your call, or whatever. So day one essentially is a placeholder. We did this all the time because people are like, oh, I got a lot of accounts. I got a lot of stuff going on. Okay. Cool. Just dump them all in there because you now you know they're in there, and now you can then go throughout that process. And so that goes me to number two, which is create a spreadsheet of the accounts you wanna go after per week. Now especially if you're an enterprise AE or an enterprise SDR, this is mandatory. Like, you should do this because you only have a certain amount of accounts you're going after. So if you know per week which accounts you're going after, you're gonna be way more successful. As a mid market, s and b, all other reps on this podcast listening in, what you could do is just create a list of the top tier accounts that you wanna go after. Put those per week. So it's a simple spreadsheet that I have. It's like week one of January, I have Google and Apple and Microsoft. Week two, you know, I got Best Buy, Amazon, and FedEx. So you see what I'm doing is I'm I'm just scheduling out what I'm gonna go after, so I'm not thinking about it. You guys notice in this episode, I'm talking about things you just don't have to think. Like, you're just executing. That's all I care about. I'm setting up systems to just strictly execute and get better. And then if you have just a ton of accounts in general, just do a numbers game. Reverse engineer with how many accounts you need to go after per week, and then say, okay. I need to go after 10 accounts per week. So that's let's say you're mid market, so that's probably four contacts. So you're gonna do 40 contacts that week or 40 contacts a day if you wanna be more aggressive. And then you just play them throughout the sequence, but you already have everyone on day one, so you don't have to worry about it and you're not overwhelmed. Well, too many people try to, like, just hit them all at the same time, and then they all fall out of sequence and you're like, where do I even start again? And you're talking about cutting it up. I do something similar to your spreadsheet, but I I live my life out of tags. So when I sequence 50 accounts, you can tag all of the accounts in Outreach and SalesLoft. And so I'll tag them a f ten twenty nine twenty twenty, which means I'm starting the sequence on 10/29/2020. And so if it's November November, I know if I see that account out of sequence, I know that I've already worked that account, and I can either choose to drop it or work it again, but in a different way. Well, Morgan, we hit it all. We talked about systems, tactics, SalesLoft, Outreach, all the different parts of Sales Nav. But one thing we haven't talked about is, wait, we're actually gonna switch it up this time. So we are gonna change the final question. Instead of talking about bad habits, which is a somewhat negative thing to talk about at the end of the episode, we should talk about some good things. And so, Morgan, the new final question is what is one thing that every rep needs to be doing outside of their job to be more successful today? You all need to go to a floating tank once a quarter. You go inside of of a cave essentially, and you sit there for sixty minutes and you just reflect. And the reason that this is important is because no one's talking to you and nothing's happening, and it allows you to be still. And when you're in a sales role, the most important thing, as we all know, is active listening. So the more you can go in there and be still and be one with your thoughts and really own the moment, then you could own your sales cycle and ask the right questions because your active listening will increase. So I do it once a quarter, and it's helped me out a ton to slow things down in real time. And it really allows you to know what's going on. It's what every athlete talks about when they say, hey. Like, the game slows down. Well, when you go in those takes, the whole sales call slows down. So that that would be my one thing. I love it, man. This has been a blast. Is there anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? So one thing I wanna say is if y'all wanna hang out, have some fun, muffins and Morgan on Saturday. This is probably the most fun thing, that I've been doing. So 11AM Eastern Standard Time, muffins and morgan. Come hang out. Ask me questions live, and we have fun. We play music. Come by with us. Alrighty, everybody. Go get some muffins. Go float in a tank, and go listen to a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Morgan Ingram include, number one, time block asking for referrals at the end of the month. Do a couple hours every single month. The way you do it is you say, hey. These are two to three people you're connected to that are in our ICP. Do you know them? Don't just blindly ask for referrals. Number two, when you're sending a connection, a blank note has a higher accept rate than a nonblank note. And you can always go in the back end and cancel your invitation and resend it later on with a formally written note. Number three, when you get somebody who's looking at your profile, all you gotta do is throw the GIF in there with your lurking GIF and say, hey. Did I do something wrong? Gets a response every single time. And then number four, templates and snippets for everything you do. Your entire workflow as an SDR is a massive if this then that statement. So if they're hiring people and that's a trigger, have a snippet for that. If somebody says I'm not interested, have a snippet for that too. Do not repeat the same emails over and over. Nick, how could people help us out? Alright. Morgan's a pretty cool dude. And every weekend, he does this thing called muffins with Morgan, where he goes live. I think he eats some muffins and he answers sales questions. So I want you to go this weekend, show Morgan some love on his live, and if you found him through thirty minutes to president's club, let him know that. Thanks for listening. We'll see you all next week.
