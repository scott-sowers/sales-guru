## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski. And we're here with Vin Metano for a part two and a part three. Can you believe that? It's a two parter special, folks. Part number one is gonna be focused on everything, prospecting, and then part number two is gonna be focused on multithreading once you get into an account. Nick, why should people listen? Vin has a really unique approach to prospecting. There's a lot of people out there beating their chest about their cold calling machines, and Vin is the first to admit he's like, I'm really, really good at email prospecting. Prospecting. And so he weights his effort on his email prospecting. But did you know that he doesn't use any sort of cadence or sequence tool at all? And so he takes a very unconventional approach to his email prospecting, and then he also uses other channels like Twitter. And so if you wanna learn how to cut through some of the noise, Vin is somebody that you might wanna pay attention to. And in this episode, Vin references a couple of email templates that he uses, whether it's a prospecting template or a multithreading email template. And so Vinh has actually decided to be one of our hero templates where he is giving us five email templates you can use from prospecting through multithreading through close, and you can get those in the show notes. A three, a two, a one, or rather five four three two one emails. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, Vin. Welcome back to the show. You remember, we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Number one, teach your prospects something new about their industry. Now it's not necessarily meaning you have to teach them something new, but it's the mindset of doing, as much research as humanly possible to try to come off as an industry expert. Nowadays, specifically, we're getting brought into executive calls. We're talking to CFOs. So it's important that they can trust you as a business leader. One example that I would share is diving into things like 10 k's, financial reports. If you are talking to an executive, definitely look for any podcasts or articles that they were featured in, and leverage that in your outreach. One example that I had was I was meeting with the CEO, and I read through their funding announcement where they wanted to two x revenue and bring a new product to market. And initially, that wasn't the use case, and we were able to uncover new use cases that helped us competitively to ultimately win the deal. Beautiful. What's number two? Number two. Use direct mail to deepen connections. Direct mail should not be used just for top of funnel. You shouldn't rely on your SDRs sending Starbucks gift cards and trying to get meetings that way. The way I'm using direct mail is for open opportunities to strengthen the relationships and get more multithreaded. So for example, one of the templates that I typically send to folks to become more multithreaded before a call is given your role as VP of marketing, I'm sure you're most interested in x. If not, let me know if there's something specific you'd like me to add to the agenda. With that, I try to send a book. So in one example, I was speaking to, VP of business development who had just started. And I noticed he recently started the role, so I sent him the book the first ninety days to help him get onboarded. Turns out it was his favorite book, and it wound up being very positive for me because I got some one on one time with him. So there's some examples. Very nice. Round us out then. What's number three? Number three is negotiate with transparency. This is the ability for you to be very upfront with your prospect, essentially showing your cards of what would be the most important thing in order for them to get the discount. And here's how the talk track would go. It would say, prospect, I'm really glad that we're talking about this together. I'm really excited about the potential partnership. Typically, there are three levers to pull that will allow us to be more flexible in the discount. The first would be the amount. And in demand based scenario, the amount typically means advertising spend. The terms the terms are the length of the contract, so the longer, the better. And three would be the time. How quick can you guys sign? So, Vinh, let's go back to number one. In our last episode, you discussed how you're never blasting accounts. So let's say you're prospecting into a CEO or a CMO or what have you. You found some podcast they're on. Maybe you found something interesting in their 10 k. A lot of people would just drop that information into the first step of their sequence and then let it roll. You actually don't use any sequences to my knowledge. So can you talk a little bit about what that actually looks like in practice? It's very unconventional. It's true. I don't use sequences. I I kinda think about, like, Dave Ramsey when he tells people have not used credit cards. It's a bit extreme. I simply don't use sequences for one reason. The reason being is I wanna make sure that my mindset is always focused on one to one prospecting. Zero templates I I send out outbound. And so to answer your question, Arman, if I was reaching out to a CFO, the first thing I would look for is something about the CFO that I can use to grab their attention. So that's something about the person. You can look on their LinkedIn profile. You can find podcasts they're featured on. A website that I'd recommend is called Listen Notes, has all the podcasts you can search by name or any articles the CFO is maybe featured on. The next thing I'd look for is something about the business. And so that would be things you find in the 10 k, funding announcements, things you can find on their website in the news that can tie back into why your solution would help in that situation. The third thing would be finding out something about the history of that account. Have they ever chatted with us before? Were they a former customer? Did they evaluate you guys before? And then the fourth thing would be your CTA, your call to action. Keep it interest based, asking them, is this something that you find interesting? Is this something that you deal with on a day to day? Is this something you wanna learn more about? That's an interest based call to action, and they perform a lot higher than a typical, like, time based call to action. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Vin, I'm curious because you're an Aeon, so you're also responsible for closing business while also prospecting. Can you tell me about the rhythm of your day, week, and how you're like, how you actually spend your time or operationalize some of this prospecting and account research? Because I could imagine you could go down a a eighteen hour rabbit hole, like, listening to every single podcast that this CEO has ever been on, and I presume that you're not going that extreme. How do you work this into your daily rhythm or weekly rhythm? So time blocking is very important. I like to time block. My minimum commitment is an hour of prospecting each day. Some days, it's way more than that depending if I depending on the amount of meetings I have. Sometimes, it's less than that depending on the amount of meetings I have. And to your point, I'm not listening to every single podcast the CFO is featured on. What I do look for, though, is something in the title that would say that it is about something I can relate my product to and any of the recent ones because usually the recent ones are more priority. Try to find a podcast that also includes the transcripts. That way you don't actually have to listen to the podcast. So for example, I reach out to CMOs. Those are like our ideal persona. Whenever I try to find a CMO on a podcast, I go to the transcript. I command f the words account based marketing. That is something that demand based helps with. So you would do the same with your solution. And if the prospect mentioned anything about account based marketing, I would just take that snippet and use it within my outreach. Vinh, I wanna actually come back to this one to one prospecting concept. So you send this really personalized one to one email upfront. My guess is you're not only sending one email to your prospects. So two questions as part of this. Number one, how are you keeping track of the messaging that you've sent to these prospects already? And then number two, let's say that first email doesn't land. What do you do next? So the way I'm keeping track of it is I'm working closely with my SDR, and we tier out our accounts, which we can talk a bit more about how to tier out accounts. And, essentially, I'll choose anywhere from five to 10 accounts that are my core focus that week. And so I'm only focused on those five to 10 accounts, and I know that my entire week is focused on them. So if I reach out to that account once on Monday, I'm reaching out again to them on Wednesday. The accounts that I do focus on, I'll reach out to basically all the personas that I seem a good fit. Typically, I focus on, like, directors and above when I do my outreach and my SDR. If he is helping me on those accounts, he'll typically reach out to directors and below. And so the way that I'm continuing to reach out to these accounts is if we have any traction on them, I'll look at the outreach notifications if they're opening the emails. If we are getting some traction, they're opening emails, engaging with our stuff. We continue them for next week. If we're getting nowhere with these accounts, maybe we'll continue with them for another week. And if it's nothing, I'll pass it to my SDR. And sometimes a new face, a new name will help get a response. And so, typically, we'll work on an account for anywhere from one to four weeks depending on if there's some traction that we're picking up on and, like I said, traction to be in the form of engagement. Are they opening your emails? Are they maybe responding? Did you get someone on a cold call and they said call me back? Are they coming to the website and engaging with some of your content? So let's let's keep drilling in here. So you're working in all of the director and above contacts. So you're working a smaller pool of people on your key accounts, and you're working no more than five to 10 accounts per week. And what was interesting is you're saying you're putting all of your attention into those five to 10 accounts per week. So you might email them on Monday, Wednesday, maybe you do something else on Friday, what have you. So when you're emailing them on Monday, Wednesday, etcetera, normally, the way twenty four day sequence would roll is you'd have your first email, you'd have your bubble up thoughts email, and then you'd have a million other emails that would basically just spam them and then be pretty templated. For you, is every single email tailored, and are you weaving in a different piece of tailoring in every single one of those personalized emails one to one? Me, personally, every email that I send is 100% personalized. Now there will be some snippets that I reuse, which are just quick parts that are often reused, but the majority of my email is always personalized. I do not send any templates. And if I get to that point where I need to send templates, I will stop reaching out to them. I talked about this on the previous time we connected. If the email is a really great email, the value prop is there, the the hook is great, but they haven't opened my email yet, which I can check within Outreach. I will resend them the same email and just change the subject line. So I'm reusing some of my content, some of my wording. I can use majority of the email across all personas at the account and just change up the first paragraph, which is about that person. So that's how I'm I'm getting to maximize my efforts. And then if I do hit a wall where I feel like, oh, maybe I'll just put a template on them and get some touch points, that's when I stop. Because then that's when I have nothing else to say. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. So one of the really frustrating things that I've dealt with before is when I find an account or a contact that I know is such a good fit. Right? I listen to the podcast or I read the transcription, and they're, like, talking about the number one priority for us this year is account based marketing, and you're like, oh, we can help so much. And then you send, like, two or three beautiful emails that you put some work into and nothing. They're not getting opened. Or maybe your domain is blacklisted, and so those emails aren't even getting delivered. What do you do at that point when you're like, I don't wanna kick this one down to our SDR because I know it's such a good fit. I wanna keep going after them. Yeah. Great question. I am an email first salesperson, which we talked about before. I really don't cold call, which I am trying to force myself to do more of. But I do see a lot of success over email. I average a 24% reply rate, which is well above the industry standard. If I don't see any success over email, my next channels to leverage are social channels. And by social channels, yes, I do mean LinkedIn. I don't mean connecting and pitching them. I will connect with them, engage with their content, comment on their things so they see my name, I get their attention, and, hopefully, I just redirect their attention back to my email. That's always the goal. The other platform that I would leverage is Twitter, which we can talk more about. Right? Twitter is good for two reasons. One, it allows me to grab more data that I can use in my email. And, again, my email is where everything lives. My call to action, my value prop, that's my hook. Twitter allows me to find things personal about the prospect, but not too personal like Instagram. Right? Stuff they feel comfortable sharing and things professionally. Maybe they're sharing more things on Twitter than they would on LinkedIn, for example. And so I use that to gather info, and then I also use Twitter as a form of outreach. So Twitter is a really great place because there's no noise. It's a low barrier to entry. There's not a lot of salespeople engaging with prospects on Twitter. And you think about the average executive gets over a 120 emails per day. Their email inbox is very crowded. Think about how many tweets they're getting per day. Probably under five, I would have to imagine, if if not. And so I'm using that to, again, get their attention back to my email. I might tweet them not asking for a meeting, not asking for anything, but tweeting them something interesting. You mentioned x y z about account based marketing. I found this resource that might help you. By the way, I sent you an email with that information. That's it. So you are publicly calling out the fact that you sent them an email with that information as well. Totally. Yeah. If you got friends on Twitter that are gonna make fun of you, feel free to block them or just ignore them. That's what I do. I will literally record a video with my face front and center, tweet it directly to them publicly. I have friends that like it, will text me and be like, what are you doing? I simply don't care. One of my examples that I had was Nick, you had mentioned a really great example. Right? You said, really great prospect, really great account. I just can't get in front of them. I had the same scenario. I had a CMO from one of my target accounts talking about account based marketing on a podcast and how they're trying to penetrate 200 target accounts. I was like, oh my god. This is the best fit. They don't have any competitors. This is an amazing fit. I was sending email after email after email and nothing. I found his Twitter. And on his Twitter, he was doing, like, basketball trick shots in his driveway with his like, that was his thing. He would put up videos doing trick shots. And so I literally recorded a video on my cell phone. You don't need any apps or anything. You don't need to pay for anything. And I was in my room, and I had a paper basket. And I said, if I make this shot, we have to chat about account based marketing. And I I tweeted it to him. He replied back to me and said, if you make it backwards, we'll chat. So then I was literally throwing it backwards, making it into the thing. It took me, like, 15 tries, and I literally got a meeting with a CMO who typically at Demandbase typically comes in at the end of our sales process to sign off. So now I have this guy on my side off the bat, and I have his blessings of of of him saying, yes. You can talk to x, y, and z person at this company. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Well, folks, what happens is because email is this private incognito channel, number one, there's no cost to rejecting you in private. And then number two, it's also the lowest risk chance for sellers because they're not putting any social risk at play, and so it's the most flooded channel. And so when I was, running the sales org at Pave, I would get blasted, and it was very clear the sequences were all timed for 8AM. 8AM would roll, 08:01. My inbox had 20 emails in it, and I didn't even read them. I literally just manually archived every single one of them versus I post one LinkedIn post almost every single day. And the number one comment, I always know who it is. And I have had people who are really thoughtful and prospecting literally call me out in the comments before, and then I feel sort of guilty if I don't say anything about it because they're engaging with my stuff. And so, Vin, what you're doing is you're breaking through the noise via Twitter, and I absolutely love it. I'm curious for you. You mentioned that there's a point at which if you have to start sending templates, you stop approaching them. Maybe you try the Twitter thing once or twice. That doesn't work. At what point do you say, hey. I'm gonna click pause on this. And then when do you decide to reengage with that account? Like I said, if if I get to the point where I've said all I can send, sometimes that will be eight emails, sometimes that will be 10 emails. Like, if there's enough use case and and there's enough reason for me to reach out, I will continue to reach out. That's another reason why I don't personally believe in sequences is because sometimes if you have a 12 step sequence, you're forcing reps to finish out that 12 steps when in reality, that prospect should only get six steps because they're just not interested. They're not engaging. And then so if I truly believe that there is nothing more I can provide to this prospect, I'm going to move on to somebody else because this personalized prospecting works, and you can only do it so many times. So whether that takes me six attempts, whether that takes me 20 attempts, I've had a a story where I reached out to a guy 12 different times over email, cold called him about five times, tweeted him a few other times, and we finally booked a meeting because I sent him a gift that was personalized. And and that's how I got the conversation rolling and we wound up closing it. So there's some scenarios where you continue based on the data you're getting back. Are they opening my emails? Are they engaging? Are they coming to the website? Are there more and more public data that would suggest that a solution like ours can help them? Yes. Continue down that story. See if you can get some sort of intro or maybe pass it to your SDR to get a new face in there. This is all in the concept of figuring out relevant triggers, relevant channels to drive to that 24 reply rate. And I love what you're doing is you're staying persistent on the channels, but you're tweaking the approach, whether it's the channel, the messaging, what have you, the trigger, so that you can drive up your reply rate and give yourself more at bats without just smacking them over the head with the same thing over and over. I'm curious to what extent have you played around with time of day or even the day of the week or timing of your emails or touch points, or do you see that as a complete waste of time? Personally, I see that as a waste of time. For me, if if I have the time to reach out to them, I'm reaching out to them right now. I don't think time really does play a part in it. At the end of the day, if you are sending an email, someone's gonna go through their email at some point in their day, whether it's right now or whether it's at the end of the day. And so for me, if I have time to write a highly personalized email at this point in time, it might be at noon, it might be at 05:00, it might be at 8AM, I'm going to do that. If I'm forcing myself to write every email at 9PM, but someday I have a call prep and I don't have as much time and then the email is not as good, I'm all focused on the quality of my emails. And so if the timing affects that, that's not something I'm gonna subscribe to. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. One thing that I actually really admire you for is I know you're you're sprinkling in some cold calls here or there, but you have identified that you are in the top 1% of text based prospecting. Right? Email or LinkedIn or or Twitter. And so you're leaning heavily into your strengths, which is the right thing to do. You're almost, like, doing the eighty twenty rule where you know you're so, so good there. Text based prospecting is the way to go. I'm curious about your LinkedIn approach because I feel like I understand the email one. I feel like I understand Twitter. But LinkedIn is a little bit different in that, like, there's the social networking piece. What's your approach on LinkedIn? My approach on LinkedIn is similar to the other channels. And so if you remember what I said earlier, email is my main hub. It's where everything, the value prop, the call to action hook is gonna live. I use all the other channels as ways to get their attention back to my email, and I use LinkedIn in the same way. And so what I'm doing on LinkedIn is I'm connecting with my prospects. I'm commenting on their posts. I'm engaging with them. I basically just want them to know my name. And by the way, I've put some time into building up my brand and my network. So if they do make it to my LinkedIn page, it's kinda like a landing page. It's like a resume that they can see where maybe that does help with repriorates maybe. But most cases, I'm really just trying to engage with them, share content with them just so they know who I am, and they feel like there's an obligation to reply to me because we now have this relationship. Some things that I've done is, taking some prospects' LinkedIn posts. I had a prospect if you guys remember that, there was, like, a meme going on about red flags. Like, oh, this is a flag in a guy or an employer. One of my prospects made a LinkedIn post about red flags, and it was about lead flow, red flags, or whatever. And I commented on it, you know, laughed, whatever. The same day, I sent her an email with red flags as a subject line, and and then I said, hey. I know that's a big red flag, and I tied it into the demand based value prop. So it's using the LinkedIn content. And, again, I'm always just going back to email. Like, I rarely book meetings over these other platforms, but I do get responses on the other platforms, which is very important. I'm curious. You're taking five to 10 accounts, and you're splitting these up above and below the line with your SDR. At any point, are you trying to change the voice, whether that is for your accounts above the line or whether that is you sort of inserting yourself in your SDRs prospecting below the line? Always trying to change the voice. Demand base, we sell into a lot of different personas, and so persona selling is very important. One of the biggest advices I would give to someone that joins a new company is the first thing you do is understand that value prop to each persona because your product can change. The messaging could change. And so we are doing that. That's something that we like to practice. My CR and I, he will intro me to some sequences that he is hitting a wall with. I will intro him, kinda on the back end. He's he loves to cold call, which I share with you guys. I do not like to cold call. And so I might share him some accounts and some leads and saying, hey, man. Like, I'm just not getting good luck over email. I know it's a good fit. Like, would you mind, like, you know, trying these guys via cold call? Because he's way better at cold calling than me. And so we kinda play to each other's strengths there. Yeah. I've seen this work both ways around where sometimes you get AEs who are really good at the phones, but anytime they try to pick up a piece of of technology like a sales automation tool or whatever it is, they can't send an email. And so they're, like, literally just assign me dial tasks, and I will be your cold caller, and I'll be this more senior rep who's cold calling directly. In your case, you're doing the inverse, which you're really good at email, but but you want someone to pound the phones on your behalf. Last question on this front is my guess is you're doing some degree of sharing of this snippet library or template library with your SDR because you're going super, super personalized, and that takes a lot of time. But my guess is you're finding some degree of repeatable patterns that you can use in your outreach, whether it's something you found on the 10 k or a podcast or what have you. So if someone in the audience today wanted to take the Vin Metano approach and build their own template or snippet library, could you give us a sense of how many templates and snippets do you have and maybe what some of the most common triggers are for what you might pop in or out into a snippet would be? Yeah. Great question. As you do more and more of these one to one emails, you're going to recognize that the personalization is usually off of a a few of the same things. It's gonna vary between companies. Right? At Demandbase, some of the triggers that I look for are new products that are released, new rebrand on the website, maybe a very competitive industry or something Demandbase helps with. Those are the triggers that I like to pull for. And so I will save that value prop as a snippet and then personalize the top and bottom of those emails. And so I probably have anywhere from probably 20 or so different snippets that are based off of persona value props, event value props, I should say, like, if something is announced that we can help with, or a podcast or article snippet. You know, they mentioned x, y, and z in this article or this podcast. Those are things that I constantly go back to, and it's very easy to change. And then I have some for existing deals like I shared earlier. I have a, a snippet that I shared to help me get more multithreaded. It's the it's the simplest messaging ever. I send it to everybody the day before a meeting, and I get a lot more data. And if it works, I get someone on one time with them, which is really judges the success of a deal. So, Vin, we are running out of time. No. Wait. We are not running out of time. We're not doing the final question. We are gonna make this a two parter because this is so much fire. Stick around. Arman's gonna give us a sixty second recap of this episode, and we'll catch you all next week on part two with Vin Metano. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Vin Metano include, number one, pick five to 10 accounts and focus all of your energy on those five to 10 accounts during a week. That might mean sending an email on Monday and Wednesday, and then maybe you go multichannel on Friday. Number two, use email as your hub and other channels as your spokes, where the CTA on those other channels is simply to reply back to the email. Number three, the email channel is also flooded. So use those other channels like Twitter. Vinh booked a meeting off of a backwards jump shot. And then lastly, number four, use email to keep threading throughout the sales cycle. One way you can do that is by direct mail, like sending someone soup because they were sick. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out? So Vin was extremely generous in putting together these email templates. And my recommendation in how you should use them is go steal them, go grab them, and then tweak them a little bit to make them your own. Because my guess is your voice is not the same as Vin's voice, and it's gonna be weird if you start emailing and people are like, wait. You sound very, very different. So go steal that stuff, tweak it, but it should make you a far more efficient seller, and Vin was generous enough to put it together. Thanks for listening, and we will see you next week on part two with Ben Top.
