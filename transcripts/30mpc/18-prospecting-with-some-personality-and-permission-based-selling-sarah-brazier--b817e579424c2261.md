## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farok, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the one, the only Sarah Brasier, the SDR turned now AE at gong.io and one of the biggest, baddest LinkedIn personalities out there. Nick, why should people listen? Well, if you ever have trouble breaking into really big enterprise accounts, Sarah has some great strategies involving leveraging up using LinkedIn and then using upfront contracts when you're having initial conversations with decision makers. Boom. Three, two, one. Upfront contract. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Sarah. Welcome to the show. You know we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get yours. My top three takeaways. Number one, strategically leverage up. I think this is something that some people never do and some people just kinda, like, forget to do. But if there is somebody who is downloading content, who is engaging with your company's LinkedIn page or is tied to the decision maker but isn't this decision maker, you should strategically leverage up. Connect with them, start a conversation, gather as much information as you can from them, and then use it to get the meeting that you want. Nice. What's number two? Peruse earnings calls. One of the things that has helped me develop my business acumen the most and understand company pain is by using tools like Sentigo, CheetahIQ, Seeking Alpha, and using those to read the key points within earnings calls to know what the strategic initiatives that are coming from sea level down. And then I use that in my outreach so I can be relevant. Cool. Finish this off here. What's the third one? Yeah. The third one is set daily goals and review them at the end of the day. There's no point in writing down your goals in the morning if you don't check back in to see if you accomplish them at the end of the day. And I think it's really important to hold yourself accountable, not only to the KPIs that you have for yourself, but also to be the kind of person you wanna be. So what's your intention for the day? Who are you, and how are you going to execute on being the best version of yourself? Alright. Be the best version of yourself. Why don't we hit on number three? So we're starting off the podcast. We're gonna start off the day. And so I wake up, I brush my teeth, I read my book, and I'm starting to get my daily goals set up. So how do you think about beyond just calls, dials, whatever you wanna call it, how do you think about setting your daily goals, and then how do you keep that fresh? The first thing is, like, who am I? Who do I wanna be? What's my identity goal? And write that down. And so, usually, it has to do with, like, how do I wanna live my life today? How do I want to be kind to other people or be supportive or be engaging or be present? And I write that down as a goal. The second thing is your role. There are KPIs that I need to hit that I know that I specifically need to hit in order to hit my quota, and those can be dials. Those can be people added to sequence. Those can be sequences built. And I'm writing down how many cold connects did I get and how many of those converted into a meeting over LinkedIn, cold call, email, whatever. And then at the end of the day, I'm reviewing them. And I think it's it's important because whatever I did yesterday informs my tomorrow. And so in the next morning, you know, Tuesday comes by, and I have to look at it. And I have to think, okay. Like, I had these cold connects. These people told me no, but I got I extracted x piece of information out of them. I can use that as leverage in my next cold call, or I can use that as leverage in the next sequence I build. And it also helps me hone in on on who I'm going after, especially when I was working enterprise accounts. So 5,000 people in the company, there's a bunch of different decision makers who's everybody's got similar titles on LinkedIn. How do I hone down who actually makes the decision to purchase something? It's probably five to seven people, but I've got a list of 400 people with sales in their title. So honing that down is really important. Let's go super granular and specific here. So you're really looking at two different pieces. So after you say, who am I? What is my role? And how does that relate to what I wanna do? Now you're breaking it down into the number of activities you wanna do and then the success rate or the conversion of those activities. So So could you give us a sense of, like, what are the core activities that you guide to when you were in SDR? And then what were like, ballpark, what types of metrics would you be looking to hit every single day or every week? Like, how many dials, what conversion rates, etcetera? So, typically, like, on average, it was something like build out one sequence for a company. So I could be going after I don't know. Like, what's a like, DocuSign could be a company that I was going after or, like, Zscaler. That's a good one. So I'd look at what's Zscaler doing in the news, who are they partnering with, how could that impact the way that they're going to market. And that takes maybe fifteen to thirty minutes to research and build out a sequence around. From that, I need to add at least 20 people if I had a minimum of 20 per sequence that I wanted to add to it. Otherwise, it's not worth the time investment. So 20 people, so I need to go figure out who those sales leaders are. Hopefully, they're in the CRM, but I wanna, like, cross check-in sales navigator. Let me make sure I have the right titles and then dump them into that sequence and hit send. So minimum of 20 people are getting that, probably closer to 40. That means that I have then 40 LinkedIn touches and 40 dials off the bat because the first email I send, I always follow-up with the LinkedIn touch and a call. And so that dictates a big chunk of the day. And then there are things that happen throughout the day that fill in the gaps. But I think, like, on average, three sequences a week, if possible. Sometimes it would end up being one, but, like, the objective is three sequences, 20 people per sequence, and then on average, like, 40 dials a day and, you know, 20 emails because sometimes you just call people twice. I'm curious about those LinkedIn touches that you're talking about because you're sending that intro email and then you're touching somebody on LinkedIn. And this is an area that I still haven't gotten my head around the best way to do it. Are you just sending a connect request with no message? Are you sending a super tailored message in the request? Are you doing an InMail? What's that LinkedIn outreach look like? Just to stand out in the immediate, having a note's really important. But I also decline any note that's just like, hey, Sarah. I wanna tell you about my product or something that's really generic. I prefer when someone writes something that showcases their personality and the fact that they, like, actually took the time to to understand at least a little bit of who I am as a person. So I thought if that's how I feel about it, then a c level executive or a VP of sales or someone who is getting bombarded by SDRs all the time, they're gonna want that but even more because they're probably gonna be way more annoyed annoyed than I am when when people don't send me notes because I'm nobody. So Well, that's real empathy. That's that's not just saying I hope you and your family are doing well. Like, that's legitimate empathy. Empathy. You're saying, oh, how did I feel? Let me project that on another person. So okay. So what exactly would you say to a person, though? Because I'm with you. I decline I I barely ever decline invites. I usually just accept everybody. But if somebody says, oh, Nick. I see we had a lot of mutual connections. I think it would be great to expand the network here. I just know it's some, like, templated garbage someone's sending me. So what specifically would you say to a VP of sales you wanna connect with? Yeah. I'm looking up one that I just sent. This was to a woman who is she cofounded a company, and she runs the sales organization there. And I sent it on Monday. And I said, you founded a company in a male dominated industry and are leading a male dominated department. Pretty sure you've checked some major boxes open to networking. We do something super similar where, like, it's all context, and it's like, everything I know about you, you're really saying nothing about Gong whatsoever. No. I think that's the tackiest thing to do. That I also sent one earlier today to someone who is not a decision maker, but she's downloading a bunch of our content. And I said she lives in Austin. I said, you live in a cool city? I live in a cool city. You're an AE? I'm an AE. We have 12 mutual connections open to networking. This kind of transitions into the leveraging up thing because you did it on LinkedIn, and you did it to me, and it's actually part of the reason that we're here today. So can you talk about the leveraging up? And maybe you can talk about it in the little of the context of what we've done and then also other ways that you might leverage up. So story is Nick likes Gong content, which is great. I do too. So Nick was downloading some content. I think there was a closed lost opportunity. I'm not a 100% sure. Someone had tiered my accounts before I got them. It was in someone's tiered accounts, and I was like, okay. Well, the first thing I did is I went through all the accounts that someone had already put into tier one and who did I already have a shared connection with on LinkedIn. So Nick and I were first degree connections, and you downloaded content, and the account looked good. Like, I went to the website. It looked good. I checked out and saw to see if there were any competitors of yours that use Gong. There are, like, three. So I was like, okay. This looks like it's a fit. So then the first thing I did is even though we were first degree connections, we'd never exchanged any anything over DMs on LinkedIn. So I said, hey, Nick. How's it going? We don't asterisk know each other. But fun fact, I received a new book of accounts, and I've noticed you've dabbled in some of Gong's content ellipsis. Was curious if you have a few minutes to share insight on if SharePoint could benefit from a solution like Gong. And then I followed up with it and totally feel free to tell me, you know, go away, Sarah. I'm busy. Smiley face. Another piece of it that I'm curious is you you write these LinkedIn posts, and I can hear you talking through your LinkedIn posts. It looks like a text message I would send to a friend where you have lots of line breaks. You have dot dot dots where it's like a type of moment. And I wonder, are you doing things like that in your email to convey tone in a way that a normal sales email wouldn't accomplish? I've been playing a little bit with with formatting just a little bit. Like, I posted on LinkedIn an email that I had written, and I asked people to tear it apart, and they did. Oh. And I loved it. It was so great. It was the best learning. Like, that was the best learning. So someone basically, like, told me, like, hey. Don't greet them in the beginning of the email. Greet them in the subject. Like, they're gonna read it on their phone. So you write, hey. And so and so, and then you write the first three sentences of the email that you're gonna send them, and then you continue it in the body of your email. And I thought, oh, yeah. That's smart. So I did it, and I got a response within ten minutes of sending the email. So are you literally putting the first sentence of your email just in the subject line instead of using, like, a catchy subject line that you're hoping gets an open? Are you basically transitioning that line into the So I try to try to do things that are, like, what I would have said in the first sentence anyway or calling out something they might know. So, like, this email, the subject line is, Ali saw your LinkedIn share. And then the next sentence is in the body, read your calling all hustlers in quotation marks because that's what she says, and hiring for remote BDRs. Sales leaders at companies like and then I throw in their biggest competitor that uses our tool, leverage our solution to surface winning behaviors from top performers. And then I put in parenthesis example how an SDR who is her title is team lead. So I put in that SDR, how Ashley objection handles on her cold calls to ramp new hires faster. Would you be open to discussing how you can reduce time to productivity for new BDRs plus increase sales excellence across the remote team? Cheers, Sarah. So it did two things. One, I was like, okay. That is Sarah actually reaching out to me. I did download this Gong white paper about how to make a case to the CFO or something. But then the double message also helped the fact that you followed up. I'm, like, obsessive about clearing out the notifications on LinkedIn. And so when I go on LinkedIn and I see that I have not just one but two messages, like, my animal brain is like, okay. I have to go clear out those notifications. And then I I've read your message, and now I have to reply or I'm a jerk. So I thought you did that really well. So how do you leverage up from there? Because you've got me to respond. You've got me to engage, but I'm just an AE at Shorepoint. How do you actually use that to have a conversation with my VP? Yeah. So you responded with a voice message, and you wanted to introduce me to your head of ops, I think. And I was like, nope. I will talk to ops. Not until you already buy it. Then we could talk about the integrations. So I've talked to ops, but so I went and I looked up who your VP of sales was, and I was like, well, you asked me if I'd be on your podcast. I said, sure. Let's get her trade. I would do that. I said, any thoughts on introducing me to Steve? Usually, we start with VP's heads of sales and then chat with ops. Easier to build champions with VPs. You said, like, hey. Like, write me an email and I'll forward it to my VP of sales. And I was like, I'm not gonna do that until I know what what's gonna actually be meaningful to him. Sarah, you do some, like, awesome stuff on the LinkedIn stuff. And I think what caught Nick off guard in your message and what was really interesting to me is you were very much, like, disarmingly blunt. You were saying, like, yo, I got a book of accounts. I'm, like, you're literally in my territory. Right? I know you have some very intentional messaging around how you approach a cold call. Would you be willing to walk us through what your cold call sounds like? Yeah. So the phone rings. Ring ring. And you say hi. Hello. Nice day. Hey, Arman. This is Sarah Brasure with Gong on a recorded line. How have you been? Sure. Yeah. I've they've been fine. How are you? I'm doing great. Thanks for asking. Hey. I know that there is no good time for a cold call, so I can keep it super brief. Is it cool with you if I tell you the reason why I called, and then you can tell me if it makes sense for you to either hang up on me or continue the conversation? I know you guys over at Gong. What's what's going on? Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Yeah. Well, I was gonna ask if I can give you the the high level of what we do, but I don't know anything about Carter right now. But I'd say something like, hey. I noticed that, like, Carter has grown, like, 20% over the past six months, your sales work. And I also noticed that you guys just released a new product. All that in mind, I thought connecting the dots, you're increasing the sales team on top of the new product release. You probably have some new messaging, and maybe you're ramping new hires. I thought it might make sense to start a conversation about Gong. It sounds like you've heard of us. You're leading with a couple different things. So the first thing is you're using the how have you been. Right? Have you noticed a material difference between how are you and how have you been? Yeah. Because no one's how are you today? Anyway, how are you? Nobody does that. Like, yeah. Have you been? Like, I just think it's the same reason why if you capitalize all the sentences in a LinkedIn message and you write in, like, paragraphs and paragraphs and that's your message to someone, you're not gonna respond because, well, you look at it and you go, there's too much happening here. It's like that same it's like this is too this is too formal. This is too I feel like it just puts it would put me on my guard because no one says how are you. But people do say, have you been? Yeah. My team started using it, and I I thought it was like a Jedi mind trick. And then I saw their their connect rates or their call to contact and contact demo rates go up. I was like, what the hell is going on? Like, this how have you been thing has come from somewhere, and it was they were looking at your script. Right? And then after that, you're doing another thing where you're being, like, disarmingly blunt again. And so you're basically saying, like, yo. I don't know you. Right? And so, like, what's the psychology behind that there? You don't pitch to somebody who doesn't give you permission to pitch. And so if you'd say, like, hey. Like, can I tell you why I called? And then you get to decide if you hang up on me or not. You're still controlling the conversation. Like, I'm still very much an authority in the conversation, and I can push and pull it the way I want it to go. But it gives the prospect a sense of autonomy, which is what I think is, like, what all humans crave is, like, we wanna be free. We wanna have autonomous decisions in our lives. If my prospect happened to have stumbled upon Gong's website and knows what it is and really liked it, then they probably would have, like, put in it. Like, they they would have bought it. They just didn't know. So now I gotta call them and tell them. I'm just like a different, I'm just a different form of marketing in this piece of the puzzle. But I wanna make sure that that it's really their decision. My feelings have nothing to do with this. It's like, do you wanna hear about this thing? Yes or no? Well, it's true. I see a lot of salespeople. They'll cold call somebody and then that person will say, oh, not interested or they'll hang up on them and they'll think, oh, I guess that account wasn't a good fit. I'm gonna take them off my list. But there's two parts to the cold call. There's the actual getting to the point where they are listening, not just hearing, listening to your value proposition. And then there's the actual value proposition. Does it resonate with them at all? If you can't get past the first part, you're just another telemarketer, and they are not actually listening or hearing what you're saying. So it's useless. So in my mind, you have to get them to buy in and commit to the conversation, whether it's the contextual lead that Armand does or, Sarah, you and I have a really similar opener where you're saying, hey. Look. I know you didn't expect me to call yet. Can I tell you why I'm calling? And then you can tell like, you get permission. I think it's like, permission is key. That's the most important thing, and that's what happens in any part of the buying process. Like, that's what I'm learning as week three and whatever, however long I've been pretending to be an AE. So how else are you using permission in the in the, like, the AE's sales cycle? Right. Well, I think, like, everything you do, you have to get people to opt into and opt out of. So I think, like, one of the key things that we learned in our Sandler upfront contract is, hey. If at any point of time during this conversation, if this doesn't make sense or, like, it's just not meeting your needs, would you feel comfortable telling me no? And then you pause and you wait, and you have to ask that question. You have to get them to say, yes. I'd feel comfortable telling you no. Because if something happens at the end of the call, you're trying to set up next steps and they say, oh, I gotta think about it or, we'll do it. And they're trying to be wishy washy. You just say, I'm confused. I thought, you know, at the beginning of this conversation, you said you feel comfortable telling me now. I'm getting a sense here that maybe you don't wanna move forward. Is is there some kinda is there something that we need to lay out on the table right now? And then you can use that. They do it better. So I use the upfront contract as well. And I remember when I was first practicing it, it felt weird. It's like, typically, it goes one or two ways type of thing. And I was, like, holding my hands in the air, and I was like, what the hell am I doing? So can you walk us through what your upfront contract sounds like? Because I find that everybody modifies a little bit for their style. This is sort of what it sounds like. Hey, guys. So it sounds like we've got, like, thirty minutes left on the calendar. Does that sound or about right to you guys? Yep. Looks right. Okay. Cool. And it and it's cool with you if we record this call? Yep. I'll go with me. Awesome. Sweet. I feel like it might make sense to just set, like, a brief agenda, and then we can go from there. Obviously, I reached out to you because, you know, I think that there could be a good fit between our company and yours. I really do have some questions right now sort of around your business priorities, your roles, and kinda what you're trying to achieve moving through 2020. Obviously, I'm sure you have some questions for me around how Gong can can be helpful in the in those cases. Typically, obviously, you know, a conversation like this goes one of two ways. Either we find, like, this isn't a fit. In which case, would you feel comfortable telling me no? For sure. You'll get it now. Awesome. Excellent. I love I love telling you to salespeople because they'll tell you no. Yeah. And then, like, the other way is and that's this is my hope is that we actually find that there's a fit, in which case the the next step of this process would be be for us to set thirty minutes aside. And I can kinda repeat back what I've heard from you from this conversation and kinda showcase the use cases in in Gong's platform. Does that sound fair to you? Yeah. Sounds good. Awesome. Sweet. Oh, and then one other thing before we get started. My biggest concern walking into a conversation like this is when I talk to a lot of sales leaders, they have this picture of the brain of, like, Gong is this we've got this amazing marketing tool, and we're all about coaching reps, coaching reps, coaching reps. And I think that's totally right, but it's, like, almost a problem with our marketing. It's so good that we don't necessarily have, like, the full picture of of what Gong does. And the reality is that we kinda we solve a lot of different use cases. Anything attached to revenue, we probably have a use case for. So in that vein, I'd love to kinda open up this conversation by understanding your top priorities of your business, then we can kinda get into, is coaching the thing that makes sense, or is it market intelligence or deal intelligence, so on? Does that sound okay with you? That that sounds good to me. Okay. Awesome. Sweet. Well, is there anything you guys wanna add? That piece is so important because you talked about autonomy earlier. And that last sentence there, is there anything you wanna add? It gives me the sense of control. Alright. Sarah is not just domineering where the conversation goes. She's giving me a chance to take part in building the agenda. This was an awesome episode. So we went through LinkedIn. We went through emails. We went through phone and then this initial agenda. So we went everything leading up into the disco call. And the last thing that we like to ask everybody is we've talked about a lot of good habits, but there are also a lot of bad habits out there. And so if there is one thing that every rep needed to stop doing right away to be more successful, what would that be? Ugh. I don't know. Listening to every piece of advice on LinkedIn. I don't know. I hate being a person who says, like, you must do this to be successful because I think that there's to be a great artist, you could be a performing artist, you could be an actor, you could be a musician, you could be a painter. And even in those things that are a bunch of different mediums that make you amazing, like Will Ferrell's hilarious, and he's awesome. Anybody's not Leonardo DiCaprio, and they're both, like, incredibly successful in their own way. There's more than one way to skin a cat. I think that the people that I found that are the most successful are the ones who tap into what they're good at, and they double down on being excellent in that thing. So if you just try to, like, lift something from LinkedIn and say, okay. Well, this is what I need to do. Now I'll I'll execute on this, and this will be my new identity. You're not necessarily identifying what you're actually good at and making that good. Like, just use those things as tools in your tool belt, but, like, there's this level of like, you gotta be true to to how you operate, how you function, how you communicate, how you read a room. Any last things you wanna leave with the audience before we jump off? Do you wanna buy Gong? No. I don't know. Be true to you. Be your best self. Are you a 10 today? And if you wanna buy Gong, everybody go be a qualified opportunity or qualified meeting or some nonsense like that, and hang on for a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from the episode with Sharra Brasier include, number one, write like a human, especially in your LinkedIn DMs. No over formal language. Number two, leverage up by reaching out to ICs and then get those referrals up to the VPs. Number three, tell them it's a cold call. Yo. It's a cold call. Then ask for permission to sell before you start selling. And then number four, use that same permission based selling in your upfront contract. Get them to buy into the agenda.
