## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigalski. And today, we have the one and only Lydia Vigil. She is over 300% of quota achiever at CB Insights and part of Ireland's 30 under 30, believe it or not. Why should people listen? Well, Lydia talks about holding the prospect accountable, speeding up our deal cycle, and foundational negotiation principles. Three, two, one, foundational episode. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright. Lydia, welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. My first is that emails are where sales go to die. So don't rely on emails. I never end a call without scheduling a follow-up on that call. Reason being is is that it's a lot easier to hold prospects accountable to calls than through email. It also helps qualify the actual real interest and commitment of the prospect in the valuation, how willing they are to schedule that concrete next step. Cool. What's number two? Number two is that you should always apply urgency from the very first conversation. So you should consistently be talking about or be thinking about how you can shorten the sales cycle and essentially get the deal done quicker. That doesn't mean that you need to, like, drive urgency with the prospect on day one to buy. What it means is that you should outline timelines, schedule call, figure out the prospect's timeline, and then hold them accountable to that timeline. And just consistently be thinking about urgency. You know, if they say a week, you schedule it for the following Monday, not the following Friday. I think those little things matter. Awesome. Round us out. What's number three? Number three is if all else fails, answer a question with a question. Alrighty. So let's start with the applying urgency from the first call. We haven't talked a lot about driving timeline. So other than just scheduling a call at the end of the this call, how do you actually go about applying urgency and driving timeline forward? What's your timeline for making a decision? That's usually, you know, in the first half of the sales cycle, what I wanna ask them. Not what's your timeline to sign that can be too aggressive, but what's your timeline for making a decision? And then, you know, if there are deadlines, I always like to let them know, but not in a, like, skeezy sales way of like, hey. You've gotta get it in by this date or whatever. I more, like, let them know, right, like, upfront. Like, hey. By the way, the reason I'm asking you is because my finance team do have the ability to do this within this date. So if we talk past that, I don't want I don't want you to be mad at me because there's different pricing. So just trying to always, like, be advising the client and being upfront, but not in a a way that that could put them off. So what do you do in the situation where you've got somebody who's like, yeah. I I don't have any pressing need right now. I I plan on making a decision probably in in a quarter or two from here. Like, are there things that you're doing to pull that back? Yeah. I mean, I would first of all ask why. Just understand why is it a need issue that they won't need it in two quarters. Is there a budget issue? Is it a fiscal problem? There's so many reasons for that, and there's so many different answers for each. Right? Like, if it's like, oh, because I can't actually write a check until my next fiscal year, you can work with that. Right? You can get a contract in, delay payments. If it's that I'm not hiring for another three months I'm definitely hiring them, but they're not starting for another three months, and I wanna onboard them with this tool, then you can also get around that. You know, if there's pricing incentives, then you should let them know, hey. Look what I can do. I don't want you to miss out on these pricing incentives. What I can do is bring you on now. Start you then. You talked a lot about holding your prospects accountable. Like, what other ways are you holding your prospects accountable and not just letting them give you the runaround? Yeah. I mean, in terms of not giving me the runaround, I think that depends on what stage of the cycle it is. You know, at the early stage, I do actually think that, like, asking for that reconnect call and really pushing for it. If someone's not willing to commit to that, the likelihood of them being, like, serious about things is pretty low. And I think that's always a clear way to be able to just avoid the runaround early on, and weed that out. At the later stage, I mean, there's always a a balance in terms of, like, you never wanna come off rude or or put them off, but you also need to hold them accountable at those later stages if someone's like, yeah. We're ready to move forward and then doesn't and I guess with that, it's just always asking them questions. You know? Like, hey. Like, I know that you had planned on moving forward by this date. I know initially you had said this date, and now it's this date, and now it's still not not happened. What's going on here? Like, how can I help? So, Lydia, you mentioned something earlier where it's like, okay. They're They're not gonna commit to a reconnect call, and that's a pretty good indicator that this might not be a serious prospect. And I know one of the things that you're really big on is making sure as a seller that you're spending your time in the right place. Like, you're not wasting your time with the tire kicker. And so I'm curious about your philosophy around, like, when do you abandon ship or tell a customer, hey. This probably isn't good a good fit and go focus your energy elsewhere versus, hey. I'm gonna keep trying Armani because I feel like there's something here. Yep. I mean, it's all a lot of it's part of my, like, process and workflow. You know, like a lot of salespeople, like, the time is obviously very important, and where you spend that time is very important. And so that reconnect call is, like, the first filter for me. Okay. They're not willing to and if I was iffy about them anyway, I'll probably deprioritize it, send a follow-up email, leave the ball in their court. If I felt like it was a really strong fit regardless of the fact that they're not committing to a follow-up call, I will regretfully re keep emailing them. You know, I'll say something like, okay. Like, when this is again a way of holding them accountable. If they say no to the reconnect call, okay. Like, when will I get an update from you? When or when should we sync again? You know, even if it's via email. And if there's no response by then, then I will hold them accountable, usually by sending them a calendar invite for, you know, a week or or two weeks out with a suggested time. And that usually gets a gets a response for you know, if it's a good or a bad response, it does get a response. You know? And then if you're, like, way further down the sales cycle, say you've had two or three calls and then they they're going dark. There's a lot of different things I use. One is, like, the second voice tactic where I'll get my boss to reach out. And, again, this is usually, like, in the negotiation phase or or the later stage of the cycle, but I'll get my boss to reach out and introduce himself and ask what's going on. The the second voice works really well. I think that usually gets a response. And then, also, they're like, hey. Quick favor. Are you still interested? Because I'm getting heat from my leadership here. Like, let me know. If not, no worries. But I just wanna update them and close your file out. Or, like, hey. Quick favor. Could you let me know if if this is still if they're still interest so I can close your file out? Like, very simple just like and and that gets a good response, honestly. 50% of the time, they say, yeah. Close your close my file. At least I know. Well, you're talking about going for no here and getting to your no's as quickly as possible. You have a similar concept when you talk about negotiation. You said never give before you get. Right? And so could you give us a sense, like, what do you mean by never give before you get? In the later stage, if they're asking for discounts or asking for an order form, like, I just would never do either of those things before as a rule of thumb, before just getting on a call with me. Like, hey. Like, I can't, like, just shoot in the dark here and and go to my boss and just say, like, hey. What have you got for me? I need to know. Because if I do that and then it's not a good fit and it's not aligned, I've lost my credibility with my boss on this. And so I wanna help you get where you need to be, but I need to understand where you need to be first. And so it's getting a commitment from them in terms of what they need and what they would move forward with to the best she can. Lydia, on the negotiation front, how do you handle it when the customer is trying to negotiate more than just price? What if there's other commercial terms and they throw three or four things that they want out of you at you? I mean, the commercial terms are where you need to get the most creative, in my opinion, because you don't have to just negotiate with the prospect. You can negotiate much more internally with your actual contracting team and your finance team. Yeah. I mean, an example would be that six month question of, like, hey. Can we do a trial? My company will will not do a trial for six months. It's a twelve month minimum. And so getting them getting to understand their budget. Like, okay. What would you pay for the for the six months? Another one is, like, delayed payment terms. I think I think those are pretty crucial for clients sometimes with the way fiscal year start and end. And it's funny because a lot of folks don't realize that that's the problem. Someone will get on a call and say, like, hey. We need to talk in three months because of budget issues, and they will hang up. K. Great. Talk to you then and hang up the phone when, actually, a lot of the time, what they mean by that is, like, I can sign now, but I can't pay you for three months. And so, again, it goes back to, like, making sure you're asking the right questions and then just trying to get as creative as possible to get that over the line. And how do you decide which customers you're willing to offer that to versus somebody who's just, like, blowing smoke and asking for the sake of asking? Yeah. That's a tough one. And actually, back to Nick's previous question, you know, if someone's asking for, like, four different things, like, it's usually a pretty bad sign, to be honest. It usually means that they're just like you guys have probably experienced it. Sometimes people just negotiate for sport. And, again, it's it's going back to that, like, don't give before you get. So if someone asks you for a bunch of stuff, like, you need them to be serious, and and that's how you that's how how you know you should actually go and and fight for it. And, again, asking those just explaining that. Being, like, totally honest and transparent. Like, hey. This is this is a lot you're asking for, and, like, I only have so many punches I can with my finance team. So how serious is this? When can you if I can get any of this done, like, when can you sign and actually commit to this? Because I just wanna make sure if I if I stick my neck out for all these requests and it doesn't happen, I'm gonna it's gonna really, I'm gonna lose credibility internally. I'm just being, like, honest because that is actually oftentimes the truth. Lydia, you've used the phrase never give before you get a couple times, and you've actually described, like, doing it. But for the listeners who don't know what that means, can you explain what the philosophy of never give before you get actually is? Yeah. So the philosophy is essentially that if you give discounts before you've got a commitment or anything from the prospect beforehand, you're kind of just throwing stuff out there, and you lose a lot of leverage. So if I you know, if we're having a conversation and you're a prospect and it's our first call, and you say like, alright. So what discounts can you give me? And I just say, I can give you 25% off. They can then come back two weeks later and say, like, alright. What can you do that's better than what you what I know I can get already? And so instead of that, it's like, hey. What discounts do you do? Well, we don't do discounts per se, but, like, depending on what you need, I can try to think of ways to get you there. Like, what exactly is it that would make you move forward with us? And if they don't know, then you say, like, okay. So why don't you figure out what you need to figure out, and we'll touch base on x date. Once you have all that information, then I'll go go do my part and and try get you there. What you're doing is like, Nick, to your question earlier, you're doing pre negotiation live with your customer. Because what too many junior reps do is they go and the customer says, I want a discount. They go. They give them a discount. Oftentimes, it's rep discretion. And then the customer comes back and says, well, I want more now. Versus if you can get them to negotiate against themselves upfront and tell them, like, what they need to see and agree that they can't ask you for something unreasonable upfront before you have to burn political capital internally. It's gonna make your life a lot easier internally, and it's gonna make the deal go faster with the customer because there's not this crazy back and forth twice. Yep. And when you think about it, like, you're getting the verbal on that call. When you say you've sped that cycle up, you sped it up, you've really tightened that cycle because the conversation turns it from, hey. Like, give me your best offer, and then you go back to them with your best offer, and then they come back to you with what they can do. And then there's this another step and another step. Actually, you've just turned that into a one conversation where you've got a verbal agreement on that call. And so you've tightened that cycle and cut out a lot of steps. You talked about using the second voice as well, which I'm a huge fan of. Could you talk about what is the the second voice? Sometimes I I get my coworker to email me at, like, scary email. Like, Lidio, you told me this. You told me that. Like, I stuck my neck out in the line and convinced our finance team for this, and now I haven't heard from you in three weeks about this. Like, what is going on? Like, we might we might lose this over it and forward it. And so and just like, hey. Like, any help here would be great. Please help me here. And so you just almost make yourself like this, like, in between person that's about to get lose their job because of this prospect. And they're gonna I mean, I'm exaggerating, but it's basically making your boss the bad person, and you are just, like, this in between person that's just trying to do their job. And and, generally, if you've built a good relationship with the prospect, they're actually gonna wanna help you. They'll at least write back and let you know what's going on. What you're literally doing is you're having your boss or you're sending an email from your boss's email to you saying, hey. What's going on with this thing? Like, this is a big deal. We're about to lose this. And then you're just sending that to the customer? Yeah. And saying like, hey. Any, like, insight here would be super helpful. That's after, like, you've emailed them three times and there's no answer or they didn't show up to your call. Okay, Lydia. I wanna take us all the way back to one of the first things you said on this show, which was the decision to use phone instead of email at at critical points during a deal cycle. So maybe it's post demo or maybe it's you've just had a negotiation and you need to communicate something related to what you can give on pricing. And so I'm curious about, like, are there times that the average rep is gonna use email where you elect to use phone? And if so, can you talk about that? Yeah. I mean, I would say for, like, the mundane, like, back and forth, you can do email. Right? Like, it's not just like, I don't have a rule that, like, you literally can't do email. I send a lot of emails. But, generally, if there's anything critical, like, always get on a call. I would either just call them straight up, and if there's no answer, instead of emailing them, I'll send them an invite and say, okay. I have an update. Because I just think those things are so much easier done over the phone. I think they also, like I said, like, shorten that sales cycle and apply urgency to write. Right? Like, if you email, like, hey. Here's what we can do. It could be two days before that person writes back. If you call them, that cycle is shortened. Right? You're you're speaking to them right away. Within an hour, you've got next steps planned already. And then also those tougher conversations are just a lot easier when you're talking directly to someone and when you're able to be upfront with them, you're able to ask them the questions you need to ask them. So I, like, really believe that in most cases where something's important, where it's like a a crucial moment in the sales cycle, that that call means best. So I gotta ask about this other thing that you mentioned a while ago. You talked about nagging a prospect and basically, like, I wouldn't call it a backhanded insult, but asking questions in a certain way where you're questioning why the heck they're doing things this way. Like, how do you do that without totally getting kicked out of the room? I find that the way to do it is asking questions that uncovers their pain, but also, like, their like, the weaknesses in their process. You know what I mean? Like, if you can say to them, like, what are your deliverables? How many hours are you spending getting to those deliverables? And so what's your your process to get there? You know, like, gotcha. Yeah. That that sounds hard. That sounds tough. It sounds like your team is very busy. It must be very busy. Why are you doing you're doing all that with only six people on your team? That's crazy. You guys must be, like, super busy. Yeah. I mean, what I've seen clients do is x y z. And what I've seen folks in your industry leverage is this, that, the other. And so I think using third party stories about people like them that came on to whatever product you're selling and started doing it this way, I think that's a a nice way to do it. Alright, Lydia. So we talked about keeping the prospect accountable. We talked about speeding up deal timelines. We talked about negotiation foundations. The final question is this, we talked about all sorts of things that reps should be doing in their sales shop. My last question is what is something completely unrelated to work that salespeople should be doing that's gonna help them get better at their jobs? I think taking vacations and switching off during those vacations are really key. Beautiful. Anything you want to plug or promote before we jump off? Nope. That's it. Alrighty. Everybody, hang on. Go check out Connect with Lydia on LinkedIn and hang on for a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Lydia Raheel include, number one, if they're not willing to commit to a reconnect call, they're probably not a priority in the first place. Number two, doubling back on that point, at the end of every single call, make sure you have another meeting on the books. Don't ask people to email you once they're interested again. Number three, leverage the second voice in your negotiations. Have your manager send you an angry email and then forward the angry email over to your prospect. And then lastly, number four, give forget. Before you go and give them a 25% discount or whatever discount you're gonna give, make the customer, the prospect agree to what would lead them to sign the deal before you go and give a concession. Nick, how can people help us? So Armand and I are not entirely thrilled with what our final question at the end of the episodes have been. And so we're asking you, the listener, to send us a message on LinkedIn and say, Nick and Armond, I've got a better idea for your final question, and here's what it is. As a reminder, we try to steer away from things like mindset and hard work and positive attitude. Those things are table stakes to be successful in sales, and so we're looking for something a little more unique. If you've got a good idea, send it our way, and I'll buy you a coffee. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week.
