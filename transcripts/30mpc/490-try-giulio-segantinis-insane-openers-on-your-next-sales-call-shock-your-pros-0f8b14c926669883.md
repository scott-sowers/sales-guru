## Transcript

There's this idea, especially by people that don't use PBOs, that once they say no, the call is over. The call is only over if they hang up, which by the way, they're probably gonna do anyway if you don't use a permission based call. For example, someone says no. My immediate go to, is that because you hate cocos or you just hate me? Right? You can even go more emotional. It could be like, is that because you hate cocos or just salespeople? People do not wanna hate. So they immediately will tend to distance themselves. No. No. No. I don't hate you. I just don't like cold calls. You hate old cold calls or just the bad one? Already, I've kind of delivered the fact that this is a good cold call. At this point, another 50% are turning into, like, okay, go on. What is it about? Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Skalski. And, folks, this is probably the best cold calling episode we have recorded all year with a guest. He is the weirdest sales trainer we have ever met. That is his name, not mine. His name is Giulio Segantini. If you have not seen his stuff before, he does a lot of real cold call recordings, and he is having an absolute blast while he is picking up the phone. Nick, why should people listen? If you're a regular listener of thirty MPC, you might see that, like, we've rotated away from bringing on lots of different sales trainers and try to do more real people who are actively out there selling. Mostly because, like, there's a lot of sales trainers who we bring on, and it's like, they don't really know their stuff, and we can tell, and it's honestly not great episodes. This is not one of those holy cow, Julio knows his stuff. He has real talk tricks, and he has real examples of what you can say if you are not selling to salespeople or sales leaders. He gives us examples for, like, if you're selling recruitment or if you're trying to, like, sell an auditing solution. He talks about SEO if you're selling web design. So he has tons of real practical examples, and we got into stuff around, like, what do you do if they say no to your permission based opener? We got into ways that you can keep your status, actually raise your status with a permission based opener. He gave us a bunch of different objection handling talk tracks. I'm not interested. Send me an email. He gave us a lot of things around making your pitch and, frankly, your entire call stand out from the sea of other cold calls that your prospects are getting. So this was frankly one of my favorite cold calling episodes we've ever done, Armand. In three, two, one. Let's roll. Alright. Julio, welcome to the show. You know we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get to your three. So, look, the first thing I think is keeping in mind that prospects are bored. You think you're unique. You know? Oh, you know, I've got my own savoir faire, my own way of doing things. You probably don't. Prospects have heard it so many times before. Right? Very first thing in the call, which is the opener, you just wanna sound like not everyone else. That's the reason why the pattern interrupt that do you wanna hang up or let me have thirty seconds got so popular because no one was using it. And then all of a sudden, like, oh, I never heard that before. Let me have a conversation with this guy. And I think, obviously, now that's becoming a little bit more overused. Right? And I think you got a couple of paths to go here. So one of the ones I like, I like to go really funny, saying things like, you know, am I gonna ruin your day? Am I gonna ruin your Wednesday if I tell you this is a sales call? Or, alternatively, for more some of my more, let's say, educated clients that don't wanna, be too a little bit more bottom up. We will go for something like, look. This is a a sales call, but it's a well targeted one. Can I briefly explain why it could be relevant? And all of a sudden, I've started immediately by grabbing the prospect's attention. He's thinking, oh, okay. I haven't heard that. Oh, he's done some research. Maybe I do wanna talk to this guy. And you're in. You know? You don't sound like everyone else, and you got the prospect's attention. And as you guys know, cold calling is a game of getting the next ten, thirty seconds, and you do that one step at a time. So that I think the first thing is make sure you stand out. You don't sound like everyone else, and then you're far more likely to engage them right off the bat. Well, here's a well targeted question. What's takeaway number two? Awesome. So, look, obviously, the opener is not gonna make a cold call. Right? And I think too many salespeople stress about that. Instead, what you wanna do, you wanna continue to grab their attention. And especially when I coach my North American clients, like, in North America, you got this culture of, like, oh, you know, let me tell you how great we are. We've done all these things. We've won all these awards. All of a sudden, it looks like that meme of the guy spreading himself the champagne. Right? Yeah. She's not exactly what you wanna start the call with. Instead, I must prefer to lead with problems. So instead of saying, hey. I'm great because of this. I'll be like, look. I'm talking to a bunch of people like you and what they tell me. I I wanna give you a really practical example because there's this client of mine that's I think it delivered one of the best possible pitches I've ever heard. So he's a recruiter. Right? And your recruiters is, like, super crowded markets. And he recruits for auditors, which is like a small niche within the financial sector. And so the typical recruiter would go like, hey. You know, I talk to a lot of finance managers. They have a problem with finding the right talent or perhaps they get paid too much. And he goes by the way, I talk to a lot of, finance managers. What they tell him is that currently, it's really hard to find auditors because all of their best talent is snatched up by the big four, and they're offering crazy talent. And already problem number one, they're like, boom. I've got your attention because you're talking my language exactly. Then problem number two is something like and, alternatively, you're trying to get that talent or even getting it from competitors, but there are now so many freelancers. Defining the one person that wants to go perm is very, very hard. So you really need to make sure you got the perfect match there. And, again, it's quoted two problems that are not gonna be told by a generic recruiter, only by someone that really understands their market. And so right off the bat, you're starting by talking about what matters to the prospect, not what matters to you as a salesperson, which immediately, again, makes you stand out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Very nice. Round us out. What's number three? I'm gonna tie number three with number two. I would say that the hardest thing for anyone is either the manage call calling or do a call calling is actually getting the calls done. Right? I talk to 20 sales leaders a day, and, typically, the biggest problem is always getting the people to to do the job. Right? And we think this is done, you know, by, you know, I'm gonna tell them we gotta do it or I'll fire them. Or, you know, I'm just gonna pay them really well. The thing is good cold callers always get paid well anyway. Right? And instead, I think something has been missing the last decade. You know, I I was brought up in a boiler room. You had to call a fire, But then we figured it out. What if we make it a little bit fun? Right? So as a sales leader, you can gamify this. There's so many different ways, but you might be the caller like me who's sitting in his living room or office making the calls. So how do you make it fun for you? And I'm gonna give you a very practical one. We'll talk about this a lot, but I decided recently, you know what? I'm gonna go a bit crazier. I'm gonna start rhyming my first sixty seconds of the call. So So I'll give you an example. Nick, you're you're my prospect. Ring ring. Hello? Good morning, Nick. If I told you this is a cold call, would you smash your phone against the wall? Well, I just got a new one. I'm not gonna smash it. What's this about? I talk to a lot of sales leaders that typically face one of three problems. The first one is that whenever they listen to their team's sell, they're not pitching or challenging objections well. Alternatively, their call seems fine, but they don't generate enough qualified pipeline. Or finally, instead of cold calling, they're just sitting on Instagram and LinkedIn's calling. In a nutshell, Nick, I'm a sales trainer. You might tell me you're a 100% happy with your team's calls, and you will smash your phone against the walls. They rhyme. That was a rhyme. Five rhymes. Five rhymes. Wanna turn this into a master class on Julio's cold calling playbook from opener all the way through objection. You've given us a couple different variations on this opener. The most recent one that you gave us was you said, if I told you this was a cold call, would you smash your phone against the wall? Right? Yep. That's right. Give me a give me a couple if I'm if I'm a sales rep that's trying to, like, build this for myself in a way that sounds authentic to me, give me, like, a couple different riffs or a couple different variations on the opener here. So I'm gonna give you the the three typical recommend. So the first one so I typically only recommend humorous either with very high level c levels because it gets so many calls that it's it just stands out entirely. If I told you this is a call about FX, would a piece of you die? Right? So that that thing that just gets them, like, completely stand out. So very competitive markets, I would go for the humorous opener because there are just so many calls, SEO, website development, forex, all these ones that just super crowded, go with the humors. Alternatively, if you are targeting a more, like, how can I say, suited up audience? This could be financial institutions or, like, c levels, but maybe not the c levels of, like, blue chip companies. Right? Where Mhmm. Saying something like this is probably gonna turn a lot of people, like, what the hell is this guy about? And the one I like this one is, like, the biggest fear someone has is when they receive a cold call is this person's gonna waste my time. Because if you got only cold calls about things you wanted, you would love that. You'd pick up the phone all the time. Right? Mhmm. So the second one would be something like, look. I was doing some research, Nick, and you're literally in the top 10 clients we would like to work within in the scale up field in Arizona. Can I take thirty seconds, and you'll help me understand if it's relevant for you as well? Right. So you see, I'm leveraging the fact that I understand them. I'm getting them to feel good because I'm making them feel good about the fact that they are my target prospect, and I also engage them for help. Right? That's that's the part. Can you help me understand if it's relevant for you? That gets them so there's so many ways to engage. Out of all the openers I've tested with my clients, this is the one that consistently gets very, very high hitch rate. Well, what I what I really liked about that second one, you were like, you're in our top 10 list of clients that we wanna work with in the scale up field in Arizona. And when you pair their industry with their location, it feels so much closer to home for them. And they're like, oh, this is relevant to me. And you know what? You might have more of a territory than just the state of Arizona. You might have the entire United States. That's 50 states that you have to keep track of, and I I think also Puerto Rico. But you can just pivot that opener depending on the state that they're in. So you pull up your notes on one side, and then you just adapt that opener to whatever industry and location that you see in the CRM there. Exactly. And so I guess my question to you, you've got a couple of these, like, humorous openers. You've got ways to make them a little bit more serious. What's your approach if somebody because it sounds like you're using typically, like, permission based openers, where you're leading with something with a bit of a pattern interrupt, and then you're getting their thumbs up to proceed. What is your response if someone turns you down on one of your permission based openers, where they're like, no. K. This is my favorite part. Right? Because there's this idea, especially by people that don't use PBOs, that once they say no, the call is over. Right? Mhmm. The call is only over if they hang up, which, by the way, they're probably gonna do anyway if you don't use a permission based on that. Right? So for example, someone says no. So my immediate go to, and this is just built in my brain now, is like, is that because you hate cold calls or you just hate me? Right? Yeah. Like, just just and, again, you can be, like, quite deliberate with this. You can even go more emotional. It could be like, is that because you hate cocos or just salespeople? Again and this is crucial because people do not wanna hate. No one wants to be hateful. So they immediately will tend to distance themselves. And in in fact, over 50% of the time, I'll they'll they'll be like, no. No. No. I don't hate you. I just don't like cold calls. And then my rebuttal is like, okay. When you say that, you hate old cold calls or just the bad ones? And then already, I've kind of delivered the fact that this is a good cold call. Right? And and at this point, another 50% are turning into, like, okay. Go on. What is it about? And then if you go like, oh, I really hate old cold calls, and then I'm gonna hit them one more time. It's gonna I promise I'll make this the least boring one you got. Do you wanna hear me out? And if it's not relevant, you'll never hear my weird accent again. And this in The US works so well because you can say, you're never gonna hear my New York accent. You're never gonna hear my Californian accent. And you for 49 state, as long as you don't target your own state, it just works all the time. Julio, I wanna bring up an objection that you're probably getting from sellers all the time. Mhmm. We also talk about this concept of being disarmingly blunt and saying some of these ridiculous things to break Mhmm. The pattern of the corporate drone that is telemarketing. And whenever we talk about it, every once in a while, you'll get someone who's like, no. But, like, I'm calling engineering leaders or CISOs or senior people, and they expect a certain level of professionalism. Or I'm calling into certain parts of Europe where if you're overly casual, like, that's a total turn off for them. You're literally European yourself. And so Yeah. How do you respond to a seller who thinks that showing that much personality walks the line between being unprofessional? For the audience that's listening to this, I want you to burn something in your head. It's very, very easy to reject or say no to a salesperson. It's very hard to reject a human being. And this is why this works so well because all of a sudden, you're not a salesperson. You're a human being. And that's the part that really is gonna hit the most. And that moment in which you engage them, hey. I'm not a salesperson. I'm a human. It's just so hard for them to then turn around and be like, okay. And so they that's the real part to interrupt. So that's in the in the simple psychological way. But then, like, the funniest part is that I've got a ton of of Cochise in Germany and Switzerland. And I've heard Germany's really, really different. Right? Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. But that's the thing. Everyone was like, oh, but, you know, your stuff will never work in Germany. I'm like Yeah. Why not? Well, German people don't like to have fun. I'm like, really? Or is it just that you're not trying to make jokes to them? And that's the crazy part in Germany because everyone is so serious. But do you think these people don't have comedy? Of course, they bloody do. Yeah. They laugh like everyone else. It's just the humor is a bit more direct, so you gotta be more direct with them. Right? So I think, yeah, it's I I'm yet to find like, the only problems I have seen with this approach from the statistical empirical evidence is when you're targeting people whose level of language is not non native. So for example, when I was cold calling into Dubai and they're not native English speakers, and then it's difficult because they're not getting it. Right? They don't get the sarcasm. They don't get the humor as easily. So in that case, I would be a in Dubai, I had to, like, be a lot more, like, direct with how I was doing my calls. But apart from that, if you're calling Germans in German, if you're calling Italian, Italian, all of this, I I test it across all areas of Europe and North America, and it works. And, again, if it's a bit more than financial sectors, I think about banking. It's really hard. Like, I think engineers are are great. Banking, like, high level banking, very difficult, for example, compared to level of serious. But, again, the as long as the objection is, like, is you know, it could be is it because you hate cold calls, or is it just my voice? I mean, you don't have to make it sound funny. You can be very serious. Is it is it just use eight cold calls, or or is it just my voice? Or was my opener that bad? Right? Again, it you you don't your tone will make it more playful. So I think you can disarm that, and I'm yet to find the place where this type of responses hasn't worked. So let's talk about the pitch part of the call. So assume person's been like, alright. Go ahead. Tell me why you called. They're fine. I'll take you up on this. Let's see if you can make this not the worst cold call I've ever heard. Where do you recommend people take things from here? You talked about making it about them, focusing on problems. And so if I'm a salesperson, I'm listening to this, and I'm like, ugh. My pitch has been focused on how we're the best. How do you coach people to change the way that they are pitching, and what are some of, like, the best practice recommendations you'd have? So look. Let let's start first of all with with having that that penny drop moment, that moment of shift. So I give a very practical example to start. So AA meetings. Right? Everyone is familiar what it is. You've seen it in in TV if you hopefully, you haven't been to one. But AI meetings have got this structure where they get the most vulnerable people on the planet to share their deepest problems. And the way they do so is because everyone else is doing it. And so what the takeaway from this is it's way easier to share your problems if you hear that people like you are facing those problems. So that's why it always starts with like, hey. Our clients are we partner with we talk to a lot of people like and this is you'd wanna go granular. We talk to a lot of CTOs in Arizona that are specifically working at AI products. And then you give them a little nudge like, hey. They're working really hard, so I give you a little pat on the back, little psychological boost, and then I start talking about the problems. Now building out these problem statements, this is by far the most important part of the cold call. And the simplest way I'm gonna give you a practical example. There has been times in every salesperson's life where they just pitched and the person was like, yes. Let's have a meeting. This can never happen at any other part of the call. I mean, objection, Andy, maybe, but the opener will never book a call. The pitch alone can book a meeting. Right? It's the only part that alone can book a meeting. So then what you wanna draft is what are problems that your audience is very likely to face. The way to to start doing this, honestly, the best possible way is you go talk to your AEs. You go talk to your sales leaders. If you're lacking this, so you're lacking real client data, then you go talk to the equivalent person within your company. So you sell to finance managers. You go talk to this to the finance manager. Hey. If you had to buy a product, what problems does it fix for you? Right? And what you want is the way I describe it is you want to use the language that the ICP, so the ideal customer profile, is using when they're at the coffee machine with their colleagues or when they're at home and even in bitching to their wife. Right? So this it needs to be, like, very specific. This is why I say they're sitting on Instagram scrolling instead of cold calling because it just hits them. Or before, it was like the the big four are stealing all your stuff. That that just hits something that gets them emotional. Yeah. And this is there's a bunch of psychological evidence for this, but problems resonate two times as strongly than a solution. So you have twice the chances of engaging a prospect with the problem. Other than the fact that statistics are e statistics are equally clear that b to b sales specifically, people only buy to fix problems. So if you're booking for yourself and you're just getting the tire kickers, it's because you're not fixing problems. You're just getting people that are, oh, yeah. I wanna I want 10% more. They're not gonna buy because they'll have a bigger problem to fix. Julio, can you give one more example? We have the audit example that you gave earlier in the show. Can you give one more example of, like, a really well articulated problem? Yeah. Yeah. Articulated problem? Yeah. Yeah. So okay. So we've got I've got a bunch of guys selling marketing in my in my community. And so the the one I the one I love is, is one of my SEOs, and SEO is so difficult to to sell. Right? I'm one of the ones that you know, I talk to these business owners, and they're really frustrated because they see the next door shop taking consistently customers away from them just because they run two stop two, pages higher on Google, and they've got no idea how they're doing. So you see, like, taking the customers away, so it's physical. It makes it visual. They see them next door, and then two pages. So you're not making, like, be the top one. Like, they are two pages ahead of them on Google. That's an example. Right? Another practical one is, like another one I love is for websites. It's something like, you know, like, sometimes they look at the website and they wonder, would I buy something from a website like this if I look today? Mhmm. And then, again, it just gives them that reality feeling. And then, again, it's advocating that problem. So as long as it's gotta be something that is gonna hit home. If it hits home, you book meetings, you close deals. So I get, like, 3,000 SEO pitches a day, and there was only one that I ever replied to. And it was someone who sent me an email, but it's a similar premise. And he's like, Arman, the thirty minutes of Presidents' Club newsletter, some of the best sales content I've seen on the Internet. You got articles like this, this, and this. So I subscribed to your newsletter. Problem is I couldn't even find it. It. It ended up being filtered in my pitch folder by Google. I know the exact three reasons that's happening. If you give me the thumbs up, I'm gonna tell you exactly how to not get your newsletter stuck in the pitch folder. And I was like, dude, that's good. And, of course, his solution were things that I was doing wrong with, like, the content of my email and the SEO and all of that stuff. But if he led with, hey. We've worked with companies like AcmeCoin, Intel, and Dell, and we're the leading provider of SEO. I'm like, great. You and 17,000 other people who blast me with 3,000 SEO emails, I don't care. But he hit me so close to home. I didn't even care what solution he had. It was the fact that he articulated the problem so well that I wanted the answer. What's your take on the amount of preparation or research that somebody should be doing before they pick up the phone and call a prospect. There's some people that are in the camp of, like, you've gotta spend forty five minutes getting you know everything about them and their business before you pick up the phone and call. There's other people that are like, you should just be targeting based upon specific personas and know the general problems those people know have. So you don't need to do any true deep prep. I'm curious your take on where folks should fall in that spectrum. So I think this is they're both right. But the the amount of prep should be directly proportional to the size of the deal that you work with. So if I sell like, I for example, I I don't do any prep at all. I've got a nicely tight list, a parallel dialer, and I just dial. Right? I'm a believer, you know, like, a good poker player plays the cards. A great poker player plays the other player. Right? Yeah. So I'm going with a problem statement, and I know it's gonna be resonating, etcetera. But if I, all of a sudden, decided to quintuple my pricing, right, and go for a much more targeted approach, then I'm gonna be leading with a lot more relevancy. Because right now, I'm playing a numbers game because I know I I can get enough for what I need. But overall, I think, like, I've got some guys in my community that like, I've got million dollar deals. I'm like, you do not pick up the phone until you have something very clear you can factor in your pitch that will make you resonate to them. Ideally, even your opener. So, you know, like, I think I think the best the highest performing openers are the really tailored one as it's the same example as Tinder. I think you can have a gray opening on Tinder, but when you make it tailored to them, then you actually get the highest reply. Right? So you're not playing the numbers game over there is what you're saying. You I mean, you shouldn't depend again, depend depending for the quality. Right? You know, how badly do you want the response, essentially. Right? But I I would say, like, I think if you're in the 10 k up to 10 k, I would say just get a good list. Thousand swipes. 10,000 swipes a day. Is that what you're No. I think she's ready. Just tap the card. Right? So, Julio, let's move to the final section, which is objections. My guess is you have some pretty ridiculous responses to objections. Why don't you start with whatever you see as the most common objection that you usually find? How do you handle it? The most common objections that gets talked about the most is send me an email. I think that's across all bloody, industries. The send me an email is the most common one. Right? And I'm gonna walk you through my three step framework, which is applicable to almost all objections. The first thing is doesn't matter what they told you, you're gonna agree to it, properly agree to it. Okay. Yep. Happy to do that. So, Nick, can you just double check your email? Is it? Blah blah blah. Right? Mhmm. Then so so the prospect's brain relaxes. They think, okay. I'll send them away. Then the second part, this is something that I don't see often do, but it's, again, my one of my biggest winners is I'm gonna ask for permission before challenging your objection. So I'm gonna be before I send an email, Nick, do you mind if I ask a direct question? And, again, what I'm doing is I've learned this ten years ago when whenever I started being a manager, we decided before you give someone feedback, you always say, hey. Do you mind if I give you some direct feedback here? Mhmm. And all of a sudden, the person is prepared for the worst. So they are far more likely to listen to what you're gonna say next. Right? So, again, I'm going back to what we discussed, the permission and the opener, the permission and the objection. It just builds that chain of yeses. And then what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna hit them with a question. So this is the, I think, the number one mistake I see salespeople do on sales calls is that they then start arguing. Right? They are like and they do the yes, but. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna send you an email, but would you not be better to have a chat? Well, no, dude. I just said you send an email. So it's not you're not gonna you you're not gonna counter with that. Right? And then I'm gonna ask them a question because between yourself and the prospect, who do you think is the best equipped to deal with the objection? The prospect. Why? Because the prospect knows what they aren't able to do in their current solution. Otherwise, you're guessing what they aren't able to do. Look. Even more simply, the prospect is the best person to change the prospect's mind. We have been taught wrongly that we need to talk at the person. You watch all these movies and with these sweet talkers, we it just doesn't work like that. Like, sales is not a TED talk presentation. Right? It's a conversation. And so what are they gonna do? I'm gonna ask them a question to get them to ideally change their mind. Right? So the first thing I'm gonna do for the send me an email would be, is this a polite way to tell me to go away? Right? Because maybe it's not. Maybe they generally wanna send emails. Some people do. So I booked meetings from emails myself. Right? So I'm gonna challenge that, and this is I wanna hear how they react. Some of them laugh. Some will be like, maybe. And then I know, should I push one way or the other? Right? Mhmm. Then what I would always recommend doing in with all objections, my first port of cause is always going back to the problems. Mhmm. Okay. Look. I'm more than happy to send you an email. Out of problem a, problem b, problem c, which one is the most relevant to put the email on? Right? And the psychology behind is very simple. People love ranting about their problems. This is universal. It's the second most favorite topic apart from talking about themselves. Right? So if I can get the prospect to talk about the problem even a little bit, then they're more likely to give me more information later. And and sales is a game of information. Right? So the more information I gather, the more I'm likely to say, look. Well, okay. You tell me this. If I told you we can do x y z, would that would that be worth a chat instead of a boring email? But the step is, like, I'm gonna accept it no matter what it is and make the prospect truly understand I've accepted it. I've listened to it. Then I'm gonna ask for permission. Do you mind if I ask a question about that? And then I'm gonna get the prospect to change their mind about something or to give him more information by asking her questions, not by talking at them. One of the objection responses to send me an email that made me the most famous, I think, is I I it it came to me on a training for some reason, and I'm like, okay. Have you ever received an email that was better than a conversation? Some of them replied, yes. I have. Okay. What was that email so good? How was that email so good so I can replicate it? And, again, I'm I'm gathering more information. Right? But, again, I'm trying to challenge the way in which the prospect is looking at this so that I can look at it from a different perspective. But probably it'll be good to have a few more objections as examples so I can give you some more practical ones as well. Let's go with one that's, like, pretty dismissive, probably the most common one. Just someone says I'm not interested. So the one I hate personally is I'm not interested in what. You're not interested in what. Immediately, you're pissing the the prospect off. Right? I mean, you could have the right tone and be like, sorry. I'm confused. What is it you're you're interested into? Which is slightly better. But, again, this is the main difference I see. There are some objections which are I call real objections. So there's a rational thought behind it that gave it. Like, I I just signed the contract. I got a supplier, whatever. Right? And then the what I call a brush off. So, you know, it's just knee jerk reaction. They just wanna get off the phone. Right? And in the with the brush offs, I'm almost always I I skip the accepting, I skip the permission, and I'm gonna challenge directly. And my most simple to I'm not interested is, like, was my pitch that bad? Just just like that. Was my pay or or or it could even be, like, when you say that, is is that because you generally don't have these problems, or is it because you don't trust someone cold calling who could fix them for you? Right? And, again, you see what I'm doing. Like, I'm trying to push the prospect in a direction or the other where I have the control of the situation. And it's why the questions are so important. Like, I always, make a very clear example. Think about doctors, lawyers, and policemen. They're asking the questions. They are the one in control of the conversation. If I'm talking to you, I'm not. If I'm asking you questions, I am. Alright, Julia. Well, we're running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great cold calling habits, best practices, etcetera. Now we gotta flip the question on its head and ask you the inverse. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? It's gonna be something really about the mindset, and it's like they're not celebrating the little wins. I I see so many cold callers. They they get discouraged. Oh, this person I got from is like, dude, that's gonna happen so often. And I think, like, the best people I've seen performing in my coaches are the one that are like, you know what? I couldn't do the opener last week. Now I can. Boom. Win. Now I can do ten seconds more, ten seconds more. And then that's how you build the habit. Because and the practical example is think about if you ever played the sport. The first time you sucked, but you you kept at it and you got better. So that's that's the thing is, like, break it down and think about what you're doing well, not what you're doing wrong, and you get better and better cold calling. Phenomenal. Julio, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a three step recap and one thing you can do. Alright. So three step recap. Number one, we went through Julio's cold call opener. He gave us couple different ridiculous versions. I'll give you two. Number one is, hey, Nick. If I told you this was a cold call, would you smash your phone against the wall? And so that's just a little bit of a ridiculous pattern break. The other one was a really well targeted permission based opener. Nick, you're specifically in the top 10 list of clients in the scale up field in Arizona. That's the context that he puts up front. And then he asks for permission to tell you exactly why I called you or why you're in that top 10 list. So you lead with some hyper specific context about the prospect, and then you ask for permission to pitch. That brings us to step two. You've probably heard us talk about the the problem proposition. And so the way that you wanna pitch is you wanna take the problems that your prospects face, and you either want to hear those directly in customer calls, talk to customers, or find the person that you'd normally sell to at your company and make sure that you articulate the problem in their words first, and then explain how you solve that problem. And then lastly, number three, we have Julio's way that he handles objections. His first step to handling any objection is he agrees with the objection. So in the case of send me an email is he'll say something along the lines of, like, totally get it. Is the best email for you Nick@blank.com? Step two is then he asks for permission to challenge the prospect. Hey. Do you mind if I ask you a really direct question? Just like before you give someone feedback, you should ask them permission to give them feedback. And lastly, he wants to ask a question to change their mind. The best person to change a prospect's mind is not you. It's the prospect. So the first question Julia would ask is he'd say like, hey. Could you be honest? Is this a really polite way for you to tell me to go away? And then if they say, no. It's not. I actually want you to send an email, then I'm gonna ask another question. And that's gonna be like, hey. Would problem a, b, or c be the best thing to put in an email? Once they say problem b sounds the best, then you can start to challenge one more time and say, hey. I have another direct question for you. Have you ever had an email that is better than a live conversation? And, again, that gets them to get to the answer instead of you to bring the answer. Alright, Nick. What's one thing that people can do? So Giulio had an extremely poignant quote in this one where he said, It is extremely easy for a prospect to say no to a salesperson but it's extremely hard for a prospect to say no to a human being. So my recommendation for you as a listener is go look at all of your preplanned talk tracks, things like your opener, your pitch, how you might respond to objections. Hell, I'd go look at your discovery talk tracks, your demo talk tracks, and think about, okay. Julio said it's harder to say no to a human being. He also said, frankly, our prospects are pretty damn bored in their jobs. Like, I don't know about you, Armand. It's been a long time selling ERP software to accountants at law firms. That was not an exciting job for them, and it was not an exciting sale of like, oh, look at these dashboards. So you have to find ways to have some fun and show the human on your side. And so go look at the TalkTrax that you're using regularly and see audit how can you inject a little bit of your personality in those. You shouldn't try to be Julio if, like, you don't have that style in you. You shouldn't try to be Arman if that's not you and for other reasons. You shouldn't try to be me, probably also for other reasons. But, like, figure out how can you inject your humanity into the talk checks you're using again and again and again. Plan those things out, and you will see prospects start to lean into the human side of things with you more. Alright, Nick. How could people help us out here? So if you personally are looking to level up your cold calling game, you might be familiar that Armon and I have put out some cold calling best practice resources. We wrote a book, Cold Calling Sucks, and That's Why It Works. We put together a full 30 MPC course that breaks down what to do, what to say, and how to sound in every single piece of a cold call. Openers, pitches, objections, voice mails, gatekeepers, etcetera. So we've got some stuff in the show notes, and maybe if my friends on the production team are feeling generous today, they might include a coupon code for a little discount. So go check that out. Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week on the show.
