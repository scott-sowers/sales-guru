## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski. And today, Nick, my brain is hurting. Do you know what my brain is hurting? My brain is hurting because we have the cerebral seller, David Bremer, for a second round interview. Nick, why should people listen? If you are the type of salesperson who occasionally has dumped your commission check-in the trash because you might not be the best negotiator, this one's a really important lesson. David talks about slowing down your negotiation to get more money and close a better deal, and then also why you shouldn't negotiate from a place of power and authority. So let's give this one a listen, Arman. I know you probably wanna get some Chipotle guac, and you could use some some better negotiation skills. Three, two, one, brains and guacamole. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Alright. David, welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. Great to be back, guys. So what we're gonna talk about today are negotiations and how to increase our customers' level of satisfaction so we come out with more of what we want and do better. The first actionable takeaway to get more out of your negotiations is actually going in with less power and authority to grant concessions. So we don't want our customers to be able to push us around and ask us for more things and we're comfortable giving. And the way we do that is actually by going into the negotiation without the ability to give those things away. Beautiful. What's number two, David? Number two, getting more out of your deal negotiations is really, really simple. Just give in slowly. Right? People don't appreciate what they get too easily. And And so the idea is if you wanna build your customer's level of satisfaction, give in slowly when it comes to your concessions. We can talk about lots of different ways to do that. Beautiful. Round us out. What's number three, David? Number three is getting more out of your negotiations by invoking what I call invoking standards. So the idea is if you wanna give away less, rather than making this kind of a very adversarial thing with your customer, defray the authority to kinda make that decision or grant that concession onto a third party, something abstract and we call those things standards. It helps drive the higher levels of satisfaction with our customers while helping us give away less. Alrighty. So on the topic of giving in slowly, let's start at the beginning of the negotiation. You ask me for a 20% discount. I say, sure. You naturally wonder, well, couldn't I have gotten more? And so instead, someone asks you for a twenty, fifty, a 100% discount. What should I be doing in that moment to slow it down and stop the bleeding? Really the first thing with the when it comes to authority, the first, you know, the first takeaway is like, hey. Look. I I don't have the authority to give away that 100% discount or that 30% or 20%, whatever it is. And in fact, a lot of organizations have these approval matrices in place, right, to prevent you from being able to give that away. So as an AE, oh, I can only give you like a 5% discount, but my manager's gotta approve at 10%. We're not doing that because we we don't trust you. Right? We're doing that because it actually makes it harder for the customer to kind of extract those those valuable concessions from our company. And actually, when I was back at Salesforce, we had those approval matrices for, you know, customer size and and for even by the down to the product. Right? There was different approval matrices. So a customer asks you for a big, big discount. You can say, hey. Look. I I I I'd love to help you out here. I'd love to get you the best deal possible, but I just I don't have the authority to to give you that. The most I can do is is x, and then you go from there. Awesome. And immediately, it sounds like you're, like, are are there things you're doing to qualify that discount when they ask in the first place before you even say, like, hey, I can do x? In other words, like, how do you know that they're not just b s ing and asking for a discount for the sake of asking a discount? We We get into this conversation of what I call and actually, I'm I'm totally stealing this from one of my favorite negotiation books. It's called Getting More by Stuart Diamond. He is a, professor, at the Wharton School of Business, created their negotiation program. And he talks about this concept of trading items of unequal value. So I might say, hey look, I get that you want, you know, this, that you want the you want the concession, you want the discount, you all these other things. Here and then you might and by the way, you kinda do this in private in your own mind. It's like, okay, here's what I want. Right? I want, you know, a multi year deal. I want the deal to come in on time when I forecasted it. I want a customer reference. Right? Like I I want all the I wanna have visibility or information into if I say yes, is this it? Like, are we done? Like, is there any legal? Like, so when you when you the whole idea behind trading items of unequal value is really thinking about, like, what does that customer want and actually making that prioritize list of, okay, is the discount the most important thing? Is the start time delivery timing, you know, keeping it as a one year agreement or month to month agreement? What is the most important things? Let's get that out on the table and then I can make my own little list of what's important to me. And then the idea is we wanna trade those things of unequal value. So maybe closing before the end of the month and it's like, hey, look, this deal just like imagine this. You're a car dealer and I walk into your car dealership and we've never met before and it's like, you know, two hours before the end of the month. And I say, Nick, I would love to, you know, buy this car. And I'll I will sign for it now, but I need the best deal you've given anyone this month. And look, you've only spent five minutes with me. You might say to yourself, you know what? I'm willing to do that because what do I value? I value speed. I value getting this thing by the end of the month. I'm willing to give the discount. So this I these trading items of unequal value, very important concept. So David, can you talk about this through the light of doing those trades? In other words, when I'm making those first concessions, which concession should I be making first? The biggest discount, the smallest discount, the payment terms? In other words, I'm not gonna give them everything all at once. So how do I make sure these ask taper over time? Well, it's good. So, you know, one of the things I tell when I teach negotiation in my practice is I say, first of all, you have to decide what's the most important thing for you. And this shouldn't be like an arbitrary thing. You wanna hint? Go look at your comp plan because we all optimize everything. You know, we wanna make it a president's club. That's why you're listening to this. Right? So we're optimizing everything for the comp plan. And I'll tell you like, you know, again, especially at Salesforce where the comp plans tended to be very creative and changed from year to year, the comp plan tells you, yes, Armand, we need you to optimize, multi year agreements and we're actually gonna pay you more commission. We need to optimize for this other product that's new. We wanna sell more of it and we're gonna pay you an accelerator. Oh, you know what? We had a tough q three. What we wanna have a big q four. I'll tell you what, double ACV, you know, a quota credit, you know, in q four. And so I basically have to look at what my comp plan tells me. It's basically what my organization is telling me is important to achieve my goal and then optimize towards that. Alright. And so let's say my organization tells me that I'm optimizing towards ARR. Right? So, basically, just the annual subscription value of any given deal. And so customers asking me for a couple of different things. What are some other things that I can trade in that negotiation to protect that golden ARR which pays me in my comp plan? For sure. So there's lots of things, you know, you can beg, borrow, and steal from other people in your organization. So customer success. I love customer success. They're like, you know, we're, you know, we're like this. Right? Going to them saying, hey. You know, can you can you spot me some extra services or some, like, extra go live or extra support? Maybe we upgrade them to, like, a faster level of support for a period of time. You know, if if our goal is to in fact keep that ARR high, then we have to kind of, you know, look around the edges for other things in other parts of our organization that, that we can give. Sometimes there's things that we can do where we can give, for example, kind of point in time concession. So like, hey, look, I'll give you thirteen months for the price of 12 or maybe I keep the ARR high, but I give you quarterly payments or semi annual payments instead of annual payments. Right? So there's lots of different things that we can kinda nibble around the edges to optimize for the things that we want just like our customers are trying to do the same. This goes back to the concept of giving away slowly. Right? Where your first discount might be, okay, we're gonna give you a thousand, $5,000 off the subscription. Right? And that is the media's discount you get at the beginning. And then they ask again, and you say, no. No. No. We hit the bottom of that well. The only thing I have left for you is a free month. And if they really push again, you can start to say, sorry. Like, I don't have any more free months left for you. The only thing that I have left is you can be on net 90 instead of net 30. Right? And when you taper your ass and change the ground, what you're doing is you're you're making it seem like the old lady at the grocery store who who's like, hey. I ran out of pennies. Do you take stamps? And eventually, the buyer is like, shoot. I can't get anything more out of this thing. I'm done. But when you just keep giving away dollar after dollar after dollar, people get addicted to discounts. They don't get addicted to free over time. And I totally agree. One of the other things though is that if you give in slowly, it makes it less likely that your customer's gonna take from you. So for example, if the customer says and and by the way, one of the ways to give in slowly I talk about is to pick deliberate discounts. So you just said, hey. Hey, look. Give away a $100,100 dollars, a thousand dollars, whatever it is. I don't know how much, the product is you're selling. But for example, let's say you're selling something that has a, recurring, you know, a, license fee of a $125 a month. Like a a 15% discount would actually be, you know, a sizable like, $18. Like, that's that's a big amount. If I said, I'll tell you what, Armand. Instead of, working with percentages, I think I can probably knock $10 off that. Right? Like, $10 actually sounds substantial, but it's actually a much smaller percentage. So depending on the nature of your business, negotiating based on absolute dollar values versus percentages can be a better way to, you know, kinda reduce those things. David, do you ever run into the scenario where, like, 15% and $10 are both, like, very round numbers? Do you ever, like, say I can give you a $9.37 off to make it seem more believable, or do you think that's just sort of cheesy? No. So I love picking deliberate numbers because it it feels like you pick that number for a reason. But my whole thing is that if you're gonna pick like a weird wacky number, it should be defendable. Everything should be defendable. Because if if I think that you're just doing stuff willy nilly, then it's gonna erode my confidence in this whole negotiation process. So if you say, well, the reason why I'm offering $9.35 is because that's 12 and a half percent, which is the most that I can go in my band. Right? Now look, your customers don't know what your approval matrix looks like. In a way, it's good to be transparent and kind of, you know, sometimes show them or share with them. But again, you don't have to do. They they don't know. So deliberate numbers are awesome if you can defend why you pick that number. So, David, my question for you is, how do I make sure these things don't drag on forever? How do I put a beginning and end to a negotiation so we're not negotiating for three months? Yeah. Well, the first thing is to understand, like, is is it possible for the customer to even execute? Like, are they just tire kicking at this point and asking, you know, to kinda line it up for, like, maybe for the future? So one of the things that, you know, I taught to my reps at Salesforce a lot and still kind of advocate for is this idea that when a customer asks for concession, before you grant it, like, let's see our way to the finish line here. Like, you wouldn't, for example, get into an interview process with a company without knowing what that process looks like if should you make it all the way through. Right? It wouldn't just be like from from from, okay, maybe we're gonna speak to someone else now. You're like, no. No. It's like four interviews and a round table then a presentation then you're hired. Right? So the same thing happens with negotiations. So you say, hey, you want a discount and like, you know, Arman and you say like, oh, maybe I can maybe I could sign before month. And I say, hey, look, Arman, I'm happy to explore discounts or or things that we could potentially do. But but like, here's what's gonna happen, right? If I try to get you this discount and then, and then for whatever reason, it doesn't get done before the end of the month, I have to go back internal. So now I'm teaching you my internal process. Right? I gotta go back internally. I gotta ask for approval. Again, I gotta put a case together. And again, like, because it didn't happen the first time, they're probably not gonna be very sympathetic or wanna grant me these concessions. So I need to put, like, a really good case together. Like, number one, why I'm asking for this? But b, like why the thing that we want which is the deal to close in a certain time frame, is gonna happen. So can you like just help me understand a little bit about like what has to happen on your side? Like is there a legal review, an IT review? Like again, items of unequal value don't just apply to to price concessions. What do you want? You want a commitment from me for a certain concession? What do I want? I want information. Right? So these are the items of unequal value that we're trading now. But I always like to make sure that you that we see our way to the finish line before we even start talking about kinda time box concessions. I need to know what this looks like. Right? One of the ways you can do that in fact is kinda what I referred to earlier, which is turn the future into the past. When you say and this by the way, this happens not just for price concessions but it can happen for like reference calls. Right? Say, hey Nick, you know, can I get a reference from you? Right? And so you might say, hey look, I'm happy to hook you up with a reference. We've got lots of great customers. Do you mind do you mind if I ask like when we do the reference, like, let's say the person says 10 out of 10, you know, cerebral selling was awesome. Like, what what happens after that? Like, the reason I ask is because, you know, I I don't want it, which I'm a big fan of the reason I ask is because, by the way. The reason I ask is because I don't wanna line up all of these these things and, you know, take my customer's time and, you know, we respect them as we would respect you and your customer. And I just wanna make sure that if there's something that's more important for us to do before the reference request that we get that out now because, you know, oftentimes there are things that we need to do. So, anyways, timeline, I wanna understand my way to the finish line before I start agreeing to anything. So what you're doing there, it's actually Arman, we talk about, like, no unilateral concessions or the rule of reciprocity. You're giving a give. When you give somebody a reference, it's a give, and that gives you then the right to get something back, whether it's more clarity into, like, what happens next. And I'm like, one of the things that you're doing is you're really going into detail about, like, what does this actually mean? Like, when are you gonna reach out to the reference? Like, what things are important that you're gonna ask them? Because, again, you have more and more discovery and clarity around the entire deal timeline and process there. One of the areas that I think a lot of salespeople get tripped up is when they're sort of negotiating with someone who might not be at, like, the true authority level. So just like you talked about, like, as a salesperson, you might not have final authority on discounts or, like, signing on your org's behalf. But if I'm negotiating with, somebody who's at the director level and the VP has to sign, but it's like a director level thing, sometimes I end up negotiating with somebody who they don't have full authority. And so how do I, like, navigate a situation like that? Well, there's first of all, there's actually lots to be gained by negotiating people with without the authority to grant the concession, because they can usually give you information. You can usually kinda bring them, you know, into the bosom and and get insight from them into, like, well, what happens next? But I would say yes. Like, the challenge is if you're negotiating with someone who is telling the worst is when they tell you they have the authority to do it and you know that they don't. Right? But the idea is that you don't wanna necessarily, you know, give the full commit until you know that this thing could be done or you you know, you looked in the whites of the eyes of the decision maker. So it could be like, hey, look, I know we're talking about all this stuff now and all these things. Just out of curiosity, like, you know, if if we were to and you don't even have to name discounts. Like, if they say, we want a 30% discount, you could say, hey, look. You know, as we're talking about discounts, one thing's what that's gonna happen when I go back and internally in my organizations, they're gonna say, like, what's the process, right, to to get this thing buttoned up? So I'm just out of curiosity in your organization, like, what is what does that look like? Is there anyone else that needs to kinda sign off? Also, by the way, don't assume because I've been bitten by this many times in in my sales career. Don't assume that that person even knows what the process is internally at their own organization. Right? I've I've had situations where we were doing a a 75 k a, like ARR deal at Salesforce, and the executive told us, who was a c level exec, that they have the ability to sign the deal. Little did they know, they'd only been at the organization for x number of months, had never done a deal this big, and realized that the CFO needs to sign off on anything over 60. So of course the CFO comes in and like, oh, could we get another 5%? Right? So, when you're negotiating with someone who doesn't have full authority, use, I say, use them in the best possible way just like they're using you to get more information about the organization, what the signing process looks like before you make these big commitments. Well, what you're doing is actually really, really smart. I do all of that stuff early in the process too. Like, when you're still selling the deal, you should be if you know there's a mandatory step to get a deal done, and I don't know what software doesn't need a security review, you should be presenting those things. And if I think about my sales process, there's, like, two or three every single time somebody goes through their their evaluation, they have to have those meetings. And when you present those things, hey. Usually, folks wanna make sure that this thing is gonna meet their security and privacy standards. Like, is that a meeting you wanna set up with your IT team? One, you've established yourself as, like, you know how to help them navigate the sale, and so you start to get some trust and, social proof. But then two, you start to accelerate the deal. The other other thing that it allows you to do is, David, there there are really three things that you're talking about that need to get done to have a deal finish. Number one is you need to finish negotiations. Number two, you need to finish legal review. And then number three, you need to finish security review. And if you can educate them on that process and get them to start legal and or security while you're negotiating, that is huge buying signal because now you know they're already planning to sign this contract. And a lot of times, a smart sophisticated buyer, they will not actually begin legal or security review until they know they're gonna purchase with you. But if you can educate them on that process and see if the organization is willing to start that process, then that is huge leverage, and you know almost for sure that your deal is going to come in. For sure. And by that time, like, they know how much it costs. Like, they you know, it's not like it's a surprise to them that you're two x your competitors or 50% cheaper, whatever it is. Right? So, yeah, I absolutely agree. If they agree to kind of take those next steps and share those next steps with you, it's a very good buying signal. And especially, like, the best kinds of negotiations are not the ones that are adversarial. It's the ones we're like, hey. Look. I I wanna help, you know, get you the best deal possible. There's lots of different ways that we can kinda nibble around the edges and get something that works for both of us. In general, like, one of the things, again, not to go back to Salesforce, but I think Salesforce did a great job in this, is just kind of educating the customer. Hey. Look. I'm happy to do all sorts of things for you. The the better the deal looks for us, the more stuff I can do for you. Right? Like, the the more you try to, like, crunch us and, like, it's harder for me to sell internally. Right? So just we're we're in this together. There's lots of different ways that we can work through. Let's say that the next step, the buyer now needs to start to relinquish control to procurement or to someone more senior. You mentioned earlier that if you get really close with someone below the line, they'll tell you things you're not supposed to know. Could you elaborate a little bit more on what those things might be and how I might obtain those things? Yeah. Look. You can talk about, like, you know, for example, hey. Look. I know we're talking about price and we're talking about, you know, negotiation, all that kind of stuff. Do you mind if I ask, you know, when you typically send things through to procurement, does procurement come through and always ask for, like, an extra five or 10%? Or, like, when you go up to the CFO, are they gonna always ask for a five or 10%? Because what I don't wanna do, Armand, like, I don't wanna kind of, you know, go to to go to the wall of my company, give us give you, like, our best offer, and then have you come back and say, oh, we need another 5% because, like, I'm not gonna have any room to go at that point. So getting as much insight into the process in advance would be super helpful. Do you have any insight into that? Right? So what am I doing? Like, I'm asking for information, but I'm also kinda telling you, okay, if I don't have this information, here's like the problem that's gonna occur later on. So I always like, you know, again, it it it it's funny. We're not we're not trying to cozy up to the customer. We are actually trying to help each other in this situation and to the extent I can just ask what that process might look like. Even and again, don't assume that they know. That they've never met maybe the thing they're buying now has never been through a procurement process before. Now it's like the first time. Can you check? Like, I just the the reason I ask is because I don't wanna find ourselves in this kind of, you know, tough bind, you know, a week from now where, like, none of us have flexibility. I've seen this happen. It's it's problematic. Well, this goes back to the concept of educating your buyers. And I find that the best sellers are able to convince below the line buyers that they don't want a discount yet. You can ask them questions where it's like, hey. Like, you you know I can only do this once. Right? Do you wanna burn this bullet between you and I? Or should I save that for when it gets to procurement so they can get this pound of flesh and it's one cut and done? And then they'll be like, oh, shoot. Like, I don't want the person who's held accountable across the organization for making the one cut if my one cut wasn't good enough. And you can actually top them off the ledge by educating them and then get them on the same side of the table. So it's you and your buyer against their procurement team, not the other way around. I'm I'm smiling because we actually used to use that from, I guess, from a hiring and promotion standpoint. Right? So Arman comes to me and says, hey, David. I've I've been doing really doing well on the floor and my I'm at quota. Do you think, you know, would I be up for a raise or promotion? Right? Can I get an extra, like, couple grand a year or whatever it is? And I say, like, look, Arman, like, here's the thing. I if I went back to my the leadership team and said, Armand needs an extra $2 a year, they'd be like, no problem. Right? Absolutely. But the problem is, like, I don't wanna get you $2 now. Like, I wanna get you $10 at the end of the year. And if I go now and ask for the $2, come the end of the year, they're gonna like, well, you already got something. Like I'd rather, you know, save it up. And in fact, we did this and this is this is all legit. This is actually legit. These aren't tactics. Like these are just things to think through. But I had, you know, one of my reps at Salesforce, I was looking to get promoted. Right? From like from small business to to mid market and so on. And, you know, he's like, hey, look. Is am I up for this? Is is it time? I'd really love to go. And we said, you know what? We could absolutely put you up and you would get it now. But, you know, Armand, we see you as a as a someone with tremendous leadership potential. And so what I wanna do, I actually wanna hold you back by a quarter, and I wanna give you experience with doing some really great peer management on the team here. Because when I send you up, I wanna not only set you up to be a a great rep in mid market, but a a manager as well. Right? So there's lots of reasons why you would say to someone, hey. Look. I wanna slow down now for for gains later on in negotiation and and elsewhere in our businesses. So, David, we've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing from, like, a negotiation and customer conversation perspective. Now it's time to flip that question on its head and ask you about a bad habit. So the final question is what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to stop doing because it hurts them more than it helps them? Yeah. Look. You know, the the one thing I always say when we I get asked this question is what I call, like, closing tactics. Right? Like, the closing tactics are like, hey. Look. What would what would stop you, you know, from moving forward this month? Right? Like, where I try to kind of, you know, cut off all your angles. Hey, look, it seems like we have this in place, we got this in place, we got this in place. You know, what's, you know, what would stop us from moving forward this month? Right? Now, and again, a lot of that, you know, kinda comes down to tone, but the idea is that customers hate it and it's actually like a human reflex. When we feel our ability to choose freely is being restricted, especially in sales, we're taught to to, you know, to cut down the angles, to ask the customer, hey, look, is there any reason why you wouldn't buy? Right? But when we corner our customers, they lash out. So we always have to make it okay for them to say no to give them freedom. That's the number one thing I always think about. Beautiful. David, is there anything that you wanna promote before we jump off here? I mean, look, you know, I give away I've been accused of giving away, too much stuff for free. So by all means, head over to my, my website Cerebral Selling. I have a book. Unfortunately, it's not free, but it's not expensive. It's called sell the way you buy. You can get that Amazon or everywhere else. And I have a new Facebook group which you can join for free and I'll I'll send you the details so you can include it in the, in the show notes where I give away tons of exclusive content, you know, weekly, Facebook lives. It's, it's really, really great. So by all means, avail yourself. I think when it comes to modern selling, the better we all are, the better the profession will be perceived and will elevate everyone. So I love giving as much stuff as I can away. Beautiful. And David also has an Instagram. Sometimes I go on Instagram and I see I get tagged by David in a wonderful clip from the show. So go check that out also and stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with David Premier include number one, never show you have the power in a negotiation. You have no power whatsoever. Number two, slow down the negotiations. It should be slow and painful and a lot of effort every time there's an ask to get any sort of concession. Number three, change the plane of negotiations each time you give a concession. There are certain gives that should run out and be scarce. And then lastly, number four, talk them out of getting a discount at all unless they are sure that they're comfortable committing to that being the only cut you have. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Arman, there's one other reason that I suspect your brain might be a little bit tired or hurting a bit, and it is because you have been working on our thirty minutes to presidents club newsletter. We have had so many fans of thirty minutes to presidents club say, hey, Nick and Armond. Is there a way that we can see your tips in written form? Is there a way that we can ask you questions? Is there a way we can know when thirty minutes to Presidents Club live is happening? And, yes, there is. My esteemed cohost here, Armand, is spending hours eating guacamole and typing up newsletters, and you can subscribe to our newsletter in the show notes. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes to Presidents Club.
