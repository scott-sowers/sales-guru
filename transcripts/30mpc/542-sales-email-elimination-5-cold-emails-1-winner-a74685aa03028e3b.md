## Transcript

On average, we get about three seconds to earn the attention of an executive in their inbox. If we're lucky and we get an open, we get about nine seconds of reading time. That's 37 words. I'm Jen Allen Knuth. I spent twenty one years selling into c level executives, but I got outbound wrong for a really long time because I treated it like an ad or a pitch. I finally started booking more meetings when I stopped pitching and started sharing in ideas and insights about their business. Now I help sales teams across the globe apply this same messaging framework to their outbound emails. Okay. So here's the rules for today. What I'm gonna do is compare five different kinds of emails I typically see sent to executives. We'll put two emails head to head in competition. I'll pick one winner and eliminate them one by one until there's one last email standing. Then we'll break that email down, and I'll rewrite it into a completely new email using that problem prompter framework. What's going on, folks? If you're hearing this, we've got a really killer new YouTube video up, and I I honestly think you'd really enjoy watching the visual breakdown on our YouTube channel. So if you just click the link below in the show notes, it'll take you right to the video. We'll see you there. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
