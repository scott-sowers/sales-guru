## Transcript

There are three big components to a successful cold call. The way that you open the call, the way that you pitch or explain what you do, and then the way that you handle the objections that you're inevitably gonna get on a cold call. Let's start with the opener. Today, we're gonna give you what's called the tailored permission opener, which has three big pieces to it. You lead with context, something about them. You then own the fact that it is indeed a cold call, and then you use the fact that you led with some context about them and you were disarmingly honest as a way to get permission to pitch. And so what that might sound like is they answer the phone and they go hello, and I say, Emma, I just finished reading the press release about the big case win over Acme. And I'm gonna be honest, this is a cold call, but it is a well researched one. And I'm wondering if I can get half a minute to share why that case win had prompted me to call you, and then you can totally hang up on me if it doesn't make sense from there. Most prospects here are gonna be like, alright. Fine. Go ahead. You've got half a minute. That takes me now to my pitch. But you'll see for your pitch, we are not advocating that you lead with information about your company or your product or your value proposition. Instead, you're going to pitch using what we call a problem proposition, where you lead with the biggest, meatiest problem that you think they're dealing with. Then in one sentence, you explain how you can make that problem go away. And then you finish by instead of asking for a demo or a meeting, you ask, hey. Are you even open to learning more? That might sound like this. They go, alright. Go ahead. You've got half a minute. Cool. Well, look. The reason that I called you is most of the CFOs of the insurance defense law firms that I talk to think it's pretty ridiculous that they have to deal with so many deductions, rejections, and appeals that they get from their insurance carrier clients that they bill after they win a big case for them. And we help about 300 other insurance defense law firms cut down on their billing appeals by alerting their attorneys to billing guideline violations right when they're entering their time. And, look, I know I got you totally out of the blue here, but I guess I'm wondering, would you would you be open to learning more when I'm not calling you out of the blue? From there, some people are just gonna say, sure. But the reality is you are probably going to get at least one objection on a cold call. And this is where most sellers drastically screw up the progress that they made in delivering a good opener and a good initial pitch is they immediately try to counter the prospect's reaction with a reactionary pitch in return, and that just increases their defense zone. So we're gonna use what we call the mister Miyagi method. Instead of countering the objection right away, we're going to wax the objection on and wax the objection off. So I know this is gonna sound counterintuitive, but let's just pretend the prospect says, look. I've got no budget as the objection. The first thing that I wanna do is I want to agree with the objection. So I might say like, hey, Nick. Honestly, I hear you. Nowadays, it's it's frankly hard enough to keep a tool, let alone buy something new. When I do this, it's like the prospect tried to sit in a chair, and I pulled it out from underneath them. And now they're actually open to having a conversation. But I'm gonna continue to pile on more and incentivize them to share more about why that objection is really true and why I should never call them again. And that might sound like this. Hey, Nick. Just so no one cold calls you again from my team, could you give me a sense? Is it because you just don't have budget for this cycle, or is it, like, anything you've ever tried to buy, you practically get, like, rung through the dryer every single time? What this does is, number one, it gets them comfortable because they start talking. But then number two, it will usually give me more information so I can effectively handle the objection. And now what I wanna do is I wanna sell the test drive, not the car. In other words, why should they take a test drive even if they never buy the car? In other words, what will they get out of a meeting with you even if they never actually buy? So here's what that might sound like. You know, honestly, Nick, my guess is you're probably not gonna buy this thing. But, you know, every once in a while, if budget does open up, the the people who do end up getting it are the ones who know it's, like, one, two, and three on their punch list. So would you be open to taking a look at this thing? Not for now, but just in case budget opens up down the road. Once Nick is in the meeting, in the car, then I can convince him on how we're gonna secure budget, how I'm gonna rip and replace his existing car or his existing tool, and how we're gonna make the implementation of the transition super, super easy, but we're not gonna do that on a cold call. So, folks, you have your minimum viable cold calling script. It's not gonna get you through every objection in the world. It's not gonna get you through every situation, but it is absolutely enough to start picking up the phone today.
