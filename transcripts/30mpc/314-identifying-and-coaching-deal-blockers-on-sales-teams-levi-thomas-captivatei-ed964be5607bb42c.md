## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes at the president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my co host today, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have Levi Thomas. He is a sales leader from CaptivateIQ. He was previously a director of sales over at Outreach and as a referral from one of the best guests we've had of all time, Shay Keeler. Nick, why should people listen? Levi's got some really good stuff on identifying the stuff you actually should be focusing on training and upskilling your team on, how you should be coaching that stuff, and then also how you should be getting buy in from your managers when you are looking at broader organizational change. So we talk about how you can coach your team on small things, and then we also talk about the other end of the spectrum, which is how to drive bigger change. So if you're looking to make any sort of change in your organization and how people sell, this is one to listen to. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alrighty, Levi. Welcome to the leadership show. We start every show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. Number one would be focus. Right? Don't spend your time coaching 50 random calls or 50 random things. Coach the five right calls or the five right behaviors. What that is is it takes a lot of prep. Right? It's spending the time to identify of the 50 calls that you'll have to listen to. Right? You're gonna make sure that you're you're driving them down and say, hey. I just wanna look at the five pricing or the 50 pricing phone calls. And then I'm gonna five spend my time looking at the five pricing phone calls that something really great happened that I wanna either go ahead and reinforce to the team, or maybe there's a massive opportunity that kept coming up over and over again, identifying that opportunity, and then coming to your team with a a a curated list of calls or coming to that rep with a curated list of calls, where the outcome can be somewhat controlled by you based off of identifying those behaviors ahead of time. Boom. What's number two? Number two is when you are doing the more constructive calling, coach close lost or close lost deals versus deals that are often in flight. I think knee jerk reaction, I wanna jump in immediately and be like, oh, you did that wrong on that call, or, hey. What happened? Why didn't you book this next step? But reps are inherently very defensive of deals that they're currently managing. Right? That's their baby, and you'll have a ton more pushback trying to give feedback on deals that are that are active. Whereas closed lost deals, the reps have already disassociated with somewhat, and so they're far more open to feedback, especially constructive feedback on things that they missed or areas that they could have worked on. Let's do it. Alright. Bring it home. What's number three? The third one is have a coaching strategy or plan. For me, it's three r's. Right? I I wanna make sure that my coaching and my training is relatable, that it's relevant, and that it's reinforceable. Relatable for me means that whatever I'm talking about is something that my reps are going through on a daily basis. It's not some random thing that I saw from a podcast. It's going to affect their day to day and help them close more deals. The second one, is it relevant to the deals that they're working on this month or this quarter? Right? Is my training going to reinforce the outcomes that I'm hoping to drive from either a behavior standpoint or outcome standpoint? And then the final one is is my training gonna be reinforceable? So I wanna make sure that anything that I'm talking about, if I'm gonna spend an hour with my team, that I'm identifying something that I can continue to reinforce over time. It can be built upon, and it can ideally transition into in either new skill or another training down the road. Levi, I'm glad you mentioned those closed lost deals as a great mechanism for training because, Armond, there's a lot of deals that I know you've closed loss that we're gonna be able to coach you on. But, Levi, I wanna go back to your training strategy piece. What do you decide that you're gonna train on in the first place? How do you identify what those big rocks of your training and coaching are going to be? Because I know you're quite intentional with it. Yeah. I think big rocks is, is like a a very apt description for it. I think it comes down to fundamentals. There's always a new fire in sales. Right? Whether it be all of a sudden our pro cert pricing just got more expensive or a competitor is all of a sudden coming out of super hot. But at the end of the day, typically, the answer to those problems is a fundamental. So if we think about the a new competitive piece, often was gonna come back to value. Are we building value? Are we talking about our solution in the correct way? And are we talking about with the the correct people? So even though that's a new problem, the solution is still a fundamental. So for you at CaptivateIQ, what would you say your big rocks are? Just so folks can make it real. Yeah. I think it's probably the same rocks as almost everybody. So the first one is that we sell the value. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter if something's ten or twelve dollars more expensive than something else if the value is what the customer is expecting to see from it. And, of course, like, it falls within a, like, a budgetary piece, but I think value would be number one. Two is that we're talking to the right people. So at the end of the day, people aren't able to make a decision, then it doesn't really matter how much value that you're building. You need to meet, you know, speaking to folks that can actually make decisions. So who we're talking to, the value that we're providing, and then making it easy. So I think far too often, we create barrier upon barrier both internally and externally for our customers. So how can we remove those barriers and make it easy to buy from us? Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. What's an example of something that you had to train on recently? I'd say maybe just to stick back to the the question around making it easy. I think you'll see folks fall into a a pattern of what's a typical cost around this. I think that's one that you hear all the time. Right? You get in on the I'm and you'll have that initial, like, deer in the headlights of, wait. I'm not supposed to talk about price on the I'm and you'll spend five minutes doing everything but talking about it. And at the end of the day, you could something around the lines of, hey. Typically, a customer of your size pays x for something like this. Do you need to know more? Are you asking because there's a budgetary constraint? Like, who's gonna make the final decision about that? So utilize it as an opportunity to discover. So how did you decide actually, let me take a step back. For those of you who might be used by the jargon, I'm is just an introductory meeting, AKA discovery call. Levi, how did you figure out that was a problem on your team? So I think in terms of my experience, there's probably three ways that that'll come to bear. One is by watching calls. Right? So watching tape, whether it be on Gong, or being live within the calls. So being there either in person or watching it happen live, I think, is primary in in first one there. So if number one is watching calls, what are the other two ways that you figure out what the problem is? Yeah. I think the second one is working backwards from closed lost. Watching calls is obviously the most proactive way to do it. You can answer the problem right away. The second one is when you're doing your closed lost, identifying where things went wrong. If budget or pricing ends up being prevalent in those closed lost reasons, going backwards and identifying, like, how long did we hide from that conversation as opposed to having it early, right, to understand, hey. What are the things we've we've talked about that? The third one is in one on ones. So identifying, like, hey. What are the conversations that we've had around price and pain, and and knocking those out there? So your big three ways of identifying your big rocks are watching calls, working backwards from closed lost deals, and then what you're observing in our in one on ones. And for you, the big rocks that you identified are we gotta be selling value, we gotta make sure we're talking to the right people, and then we need to make it easy to buy from us. How do you then integrate those big three rocks into how you're training and coaching your team over a week, a month, a quarter? Yeah. I'd say the the first one is to to do your best to identify trends. Right? I think at the end of the day, we're trying to make the most use of our time and spread that across the the greatest amount of outcome. And so anytime that we can identify a trend that's happening either on a large subset of our deals but or a large subset of our team, that's typically where all where we'll focus in and identify, hey. Where do we need to spend some time training or coaching? And then from there, it's like, how do we allocate our resources appropriately to manage that? Sometimes it is like a full on training. You're gonna spend thirty days and and four weeks, and we're gonna focus on this on every single team meeting and bring five calls that are representative of the problem. And sometimes it's maybe someone on your team is really great at this, and so they're gonna become a a SME or a subject matter expert on overcoming that objection or meeting the expectations of the customer there, and then we'll allocate resources from within the team. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Let's go back to that example of reps are struggling when they're asked about price on a discovery call. What did the training program look like for that? Yeah. Historically, I would say that this came to bear at Outreach. And we've we've been through maybe two years where we were very, let's say, skittish around offering that upfront. It was an incredibly competitive marketplace, and we were the most expensive in the market. Right? So everybody was afraid of of bringing that upfront. I think at the end of the day, the training was narrowed down to not hiding from it and to use it as an opportunity to discover. So the training was about discovery. Is I would say not to bury the lead. But at the end of the day, it's like, when that question is asked, what are the five questions that we can ask on the tail end of that? First one is why. So I think that it's really easy to say, hey. Respect the question. Why isn't it important this early in the conversation? Is there budgetary, like, constraints that we're trying to meet? So on on that one particular being a a smaller problem, but definitely more prevalent across the team, on that one, we attempted to rotate it into a a, like, a broader training. So the first one is we identified, like, five calls in which it was happening. So that same sort of process that we talked about previously, we looked at 25 calls. We found the three or four that it was most prevalent or most egregious. We looked at the tape as a team, and then we talked about, hey. What would be a better way to answer this question that felt more direct and felt more comfortable for the customer. And then we were able to pivot that into an opportunity to discover off of that. And so that particular, objection became a a in, inflection point to discover more around why around the question. So you run that training. And at that point, are you reinforcing what is a pretty simple concept over several weeks? Or were you like, no. Once we ran this training, they got the point? The reinforcement became on the discovery questions that were the tail end of that. So we identified the problem. And then from there, we went back and say, hey. Are we asking these five questions or these two questions whenever we receive that objection or whenever we receive that sort of feedback from the customer? Gotcha. And did you continue to coach discovery calls based on this specific point indefinitely in the future, or did you go and or was this, like, one of those things where once you got the concept hammered home with your team, you just went on to train something else? Yeah. You can let it you can let it go once once it stops becoming, so prevalent in your calls that you're observing. Question for you then. So the current team was trained on, hey. When we get asked about price, here's how we respond to that. Did you then do anything to make sure new reps who were onboarding didn't run into the same problem? Or how did you address the skill gap between people who are coming aboard and people who had already been through all sorts of different trainings, expectations, etcetera? Yeah. I think this is where you can take training from being good to, like, legendary is the documentation and reinforcement over time. So when you identify something like like this in this scenario, right, and you spend the time, whether it be one week or one training or or three weeks or three trainings, how do we then memorialize that so that it goes forward to to all future folks. Right? And so that's what we do in that scenario is, like, when those happened, they're captured, the training document is captured, and then we find a way to build that in to onboarding and enablement. And so where did that live for you? Were you creating, like, a a library of calls? Did you have a Notion document? I'm curious about, like, how you actually communicated that to folks who are onboarding. Yeah. So, typically, the, like, the way that we would train is there was, like, the next six weeks planned out. So there was a doc. These are the the next six weeks. Some were blank. Some were ready to be filled in with something that was, like, top of mind. Though when those sort of training documents and calls that we identified were they would be saved in the, obviously, the Google Sheet. And then from there, they'd be put into Seismic so that they could be leveraged in the future. We also, of course, use Outreach, and so there was the idea of creating call folders. You can do the same thing within Gong. And so, hey. If you're having problems with, IMs, you can immediately direct someone that here's five examples of how to do it right. What you're doing, Levi, is super smart. And the reason for that is as you learn things in the field, your training program needs to be dynamic. And you need to be able to train your team on one training in one week for a simple concept. And the three units of time that I oftentimes think of when I'm training my team are a week, a month, and a quarter. A week long training or a single one off training is oftentimes just folded into a bigger training. So for example, this concept of not mentioning price or not discussing price on a discovery call would just be folded into the pricing or the negotiation training, for example, or maybe into the discovery call. It wouldn't usually warrant a new training. If I've got to reinforce something for a month, that probably means in my onboarding program, I'm gonna add an entire new training because this is a meaty topic on its own. But if I have to reinforce something for a quarter, our team is struggling on getting to power, I probably have to change multiple trainings because that concept is so big and so complex that multi threading needs to live a little bit in the discovery training. It needs to live in the next steps training. It needs to live in the joint execution plan training. And now it's actually impacting multiple different trainings and probably has one of its own as well. So let's get off the one week one training, and let's go to a meteor training. So, Levi, what is an example of something that you had to train for either a month or a quarter long? Yeah. I think the the best example was in Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. As as the market shift happened, call it about a year and a half ago, all of a sudden, there was that reef that flashlight shine back on fundamentals, and MEDDPIC all of a sudden revived itself from five or six years ago and became the hot thing. It's training MEDDPIC at Outreach, I would say, would be a great example of a a quarter or a multi quarter initiative. Training your team on Medpick is literally a forecasting slash process overhaul from scratch. On the high level, what did that quarter long or however long training program look like? The first thing with anything that big is buy in. At the end of the day, it's hard to change a small a small behavior and to change literally every part of of the process. So the first thing you have to capture is buy in. Think the most important place to get that buy in is managers. So at that time, I was in a hybrid role where I was supporting all the managers across basically the the entire planet without reason. So at the end of the day, the managers are going to be driving the the final reinforcement. And without them, it doesn't matter what you do. It it's gone. So most training, especially that big, is a manager driven activity. So getting them on board. So they said that's first one, which is just the the the buy in. And the second one is the plan over that whole period of time. Now it doesn't mean that you have to have every single piece mapped out, but you need to have milestones mapped out. You need to have outcomes mapped out, and you need to have a deadline for when you're gonna hit those milestones. And you fill in the blanks in, like, the individual trainings as you move forward. Could you give examples of those milestones and deadlines? So with MEDDPIC, it's really easy. Right? Like, I think you start at the beginning. You start with the the discovery call and pieces of MEDDPIC that that live there. That could tie, obviously, the things like sales stages as well. But are we nailing asking questions around MEDDPIC? Right? And what that feedback is, once again, the fundamental piece is are we doing great discovery? And so what are the five questions that we can drill into our teams into our team's head of questions to ask to get to that metric to identify the pain? And what are the five things that they can listen to or listen for to help, like, spur. Okay. Okay. Hey. Now it's my time to to to ask this question. The other thing that you mentioned first was actually, hey. This isn't gonna work out. You can have the best plan with milestones, outcomes, dates. You can have an awesome plan. But if your managers are not bought in into actually helping teach, implement, and reinforce this, it's ultimately gonna fail. So when that decision was made and you were told, Levi, this is what we're doing. Talk to me about what that first conversation looked like with any individual manager. How did you bring this to them? How did you position it? And how did you ultimately win their buy in even with some folks who might have been initially resistant? As with everything, right, like, sales is sales. It doesn't really matter if you're selling a customer or a manager or a rep or what have you or your VP. The the first one is make it easy. Right? And when I think one of the easiest ways to make something easy is make the process transparent. Hey. This is what's gonna be expected from you. This is what's expected from me. This is what's expected from the business, and this is what's expected from the rep. So laying out all the expectations is so important because in people's mind, the work that they'll have to do for something is always five times more than what it really is. So assuaging those fears early is really important. And then the second one is just about outcomes. Right? So what's the outcome? What's the WIFM, the what's in it for them? What's the outcome that that we'll drive together? Right? And why is it worth their time? So this is how much time you're gonna spend. This is how much it's worth. And then now we just have to do the math on whether or not the ROI is there for them just like any other cell that we would do in any other time. What if you have someone who's not really a fan of this? I don't really think, like, they don't buy in they don't believe in MEDDIC or MEDDPIC, and literally the only what's in it for them is this is the way you're gonna keep your job. Do you what does it look like when you have more of a a stick rather than a carrot conversation? I think that's where buy in from leadership then becomes really important. Right? Buy in from the rest of the org. Very rarely does that is that person by themselves. Right? So it's really difficult for someone to be the one person that's on, oh, I don't believe in this. I'm not gonna to row forward. So the answer to that question is it's it's almost like that saying Fire Your Works customer. The idea is if you have one person that absolutely know it won't move when everybody else is, it's a different problem. Right? If if you've done the due diligence, you've done the work, you have buy it everywhere else, then that's a problem to solve on with another conversation. So let's say, buy in, I'd say the the answer to your question is an additional level of buy in on their boss, the VP, the CEO, that this is an initiative that we're all going to believe in and carry forward. One thing that helped me a lot was when I used to coach wrestling, oftentimes, you get the kid with the bad attitude. And sometimes the kid with the bad attitude was actually the most talented kid on the team. And so what I would do is I would make them my drilling partner. I'd be like, great. You and I are gonna demonstrate the moves together. So you actually put them front and center as the star of the show. And that oftentimes is the case with some of your top performers who think they know it all. Usually, your top performers a lot of them, the best ones will be open to change, but a lot of people, when they're at the top, they're like, I know what I'm doing. And so the first thing that I would do is I would actually get them on board with it. So if I knew our team was struggling with price, I would go to my top rep, Morgan Mello, and I would be like, hey, Morgan. Could you run this negotiation training for me? And here are the things that I want you to help me run with it. And by her feeling like she's rolling it out, not having it be received by her, she's way more bought in, and then everyone else follows the top rep. So if you can flip your top three, the rest of the team will turn. And then if there are any people left, to your point, it's a hard conversation. But usually, that will get you most of the way there. I wouldn't say that that kind of is a callback to when I mentioned around having a SME or a subject matter expert. Right? Anytime that you can allocate resources from a manager on the team or they even, like, a rep on the team, hey. You're gonna you're gonna be my my metrics my metrics person. And and, hey. You really seem to be you used to really seem to gravitate towards this. Would you mind running some trainings? I think anytime you can surround the problem with more folks, a, it's a great use of time because you outsource it. And b, it's it helps build it just helps move the deal forward, remove the the conversation forward. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. So, Lida, I wanna go to the last piece that it got my attention early. You talked about a lot of your coaching conversations you have with reps are centered around deals that are already centered around deals that are already closed lost. And I'm curious about this because I sell all of our sponsorships for thirty minutes to president's club. And last week, I sent our team a list of all of the ops that we've lost in the last year. And I'm curious, like, when you look at a list like that, where are you choosing to focus on the coaching? Is it on the most recently lost ops? Is it on the ones that had the biggest deal size? Is it the ones that you personally knew the most about? Is it just like intuition? How are you deciding which closed lot loss ops you are focusing the coaching conversations on? I think ideally, there it's the op that helps drive the conversation or helps drive the behavior forward. So there's very few op like, you were there. Right? You were there on the one on one calls and you listened to that call live and maybe you were on that call. So you were part of it too. And so you probably have an idea of what went wrong. And so if I have a rep that I'm really working on having great pricing conversations, having great discovery conversations, then the call I'm bringing to bear is probably the one that feeds into that narrative or the five that feeds into that narrative. And that kinda takes some prep. It's like that moment when you're on the call and you wanna give that immediate feedback of, hey. You really blew it here. Instead, make a note. Make a note to revisit it in forty five days or thirty days or what have you. Let it cool off. And that's and that feels weird. Right? That feels counterproductive, but I think there's a lot to be learned from thinking about a year as opposed to right now. That'll help you on the next fifty or a 100 or five. I'm actually so there's a couple follow-up questions I have to it. Is one, like, where are you actually storing those notes? Do you have a a system that you're using to keep track of that? Two, how are you broaching that conversation with the rep? Like, how do you bring it up? Do you bring it up on the one on one? Are you like, hey. Remember what happened four months ago with that deal? Those are some things where my head naturally goes that I'm curious about. So, Liva, I wanna take this one step higher. This is once you've already decided that you need some closed loss opportunities because you say, hey. My team's struggling with price or they're losing to no budget, for example. I know one way you're identifying these trends is by watching calls. The other way that you mentioned as number two was through closed loss reports. And I've struggled with this a lot in the past because I find that reps tend to not know why they're losing deals and aren't always the best at diagnosing. And sometimes the data can be really messy and noisy. And so I'm curious. How are you approaching closed loss reporting differently? I'd say one is tag it while it's it's warm. Right? So when every week, I think a a great exercise, any manager can go through is every week, look at every deal that was closed lost. And and tag the ones that stand out to you. There'll be eight of them that died after the demo because you were talking to the wrong person or what have you. But there'll be the two or three that will almost certainly stand out. Tag those for later. For me, I I keep track in an Excel or I'm sorry. Like, a Google Sheet, and I like to folder them. Hey. These are the four calls that bucket into we lost because of price, and I don't think we should have. So this is an area that we messed up. This was on us, and these are the four calls that that drive into it. And I think it's all about, like, planning for the future. It's like, we're constantly in the trenches giving feedback to our team. But are we planning for three months from now when we have a critical mass of, like, 10 calls that we can really dissect and and analyze and then help to build that foundation and that sort of, like, pattern recognition for the team. To to your point, Armand, is everyone's bad in the moment, and it's not until you can create that critical mass of five examples of you doing the same thing over and over then. In that point, you can really drill the time the point home. It's unrefutable. So this is a really smart nuance, and the reason for that is let's use the example of closed loss due to price. That might be what the prospect cited, and usually you can get good data on that. Now what you need to do is that's when you need to use your brain as a leader where you say, okay, what are all the reasons a deal could be closed loss due to price? One of which is we don't know how to handle competitors. We don't know how to do great discovery. And the last reason might be, yeah, we're too expensive. But it at least tells you what the prospects are saying so you can have truth in that because usually closed loss due to I couldn't do good discovery is usually not a closed loss reason to my knowledge. And if it ever was, it would never be one that is used. That said, the one other metric that I find really helpful for coaching, and I'm curious how you use these things, is stage drop off. So while a rep might not know if a deal was closed lost due to price because of a value issue or a competitor issue, you can almost always be certain. Deal is dropping off in the multithreading phase. It probably has something to do with their ability to win over power or get to power. And so I'm curious, how do you use stage conversion, if at all, relative to your closed loss reasons? Yeah. I think it'll depend a little bit in, yeah, I'd say the difficulty with stage conversion is, like, most metrics that are dependent on a sales rep moving a deal manually either through a Salesforce stage or through a pipeline stage. Most stages that I've seen, they'll move to one and two, whatever that looks like. They're top 20%. Right? Because they have to because they have to do that in order to move to qualified or what have you. And then all of a sudden, there's this sort of, like, ghost town of 20 to 75, and that's where all the deals, like, all the deals die. And if you're gonna use stages, it means that you're signing up for the massive lift of hammering home stages on every single one on one call with your team forever because they're never gonna do it naturally. I just have never seen, like, a rep that does it. So I think stages are helpful, and they're more helpful the fewer they are and the fewer barriers there are, to entry. Pipeline stages, I think, is what I've used more, like, more aptly in the past. So being able to say, hey. This is best case or this is likely or whatever you wanna call them. And so identifying, hey. Why did my deal in commit die? Or why did my deal deal in best case die? I think from a staging perspective, that is helpful, and I've used that in the past. Levi, we gotta move to the next stage, the final stage of this interview, which is the final question. We're running out of time. And the last question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things leaders should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what's one thing that leaders should stop doing so that every team that they coach gets better and better? So the number one thing a leader should stop doing is wasting people's time. Right? I would say that's my hot take. So wasting people's time is if you're not coming prepared, then how are you gonna expect your team to come prepared to their calls? So when you're gonna have an interaction action, whether it be a team meeting or a one on one, do the prep work, come prepared, have an outcome in mind, and drive the conversation towards that. And stop wasting everybody's time with things that don't move the team forward. Amazing show, Levi. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It is time for a two by two recap email from this episode with Levi Thomas. What do you have for your two? So first one is when you are looking to identify your big rocks of where you need to focus on with the team, there are three sources of where you can identify that stuff. Source number one is by watching call recordings. Source number two is by working backwards from closed lost deals. And then source number three is from what you can glean from your one on ones. Takeaway number two is each week, you should automate a report that shows you all of the deals that were closed lost that week. And then you should look at them and tag the ones that you think are indicative of a broader theme that you might want to focus on with the team in the next month or quarter. Number three. There are three different styles of trainings. You could do one week, one training. You could have something that goes a month long where you might have to do one training and three reinforcements, or you might need to teach something over a quarter, and your program should reflect the intensity of that training appropriately. And lastly, number four, whenever you're rolling out one of those bigger trainings, let's say you're trying to train your team on MEDDPIC over a quarter, you need to start by getting the managers bought in and your top reps bought in. That might mean you should have them literally deliver some of the trainings on your behalf. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? If you liked this episode and you want a full playbook on how to train your team, Armond, I know that you and Mark recorded a 30 MPC playbook episode on how to train your team. We will put a link in the show notes if you wanna go listen to that one. But if you like this one, you probably should listen to that one. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
