## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Frogg, and I'm here with my co host Nick Szygalski. And today, folks, we've done this a couple times recently where we've gotten a lot of requests for more of the Nick and Armand only episodes or the Mark and Mondo playbook episodes. And so this is another one where Nick is going to interview me on how to run a kick ass tape review in sales. Nick, why should people listen? Great episode top to bottom on how to run a tape review that doesn't suck. We talked about everything as to why you should do them in the first place because they do take some time, where you should get the tapes and which tapes you should choose, how you set up the board and have the rep introduce the tail of the tape before you actually get into the review, who drives the screen share, other things you're actually showing during the tape review because you're not spending the whole time in the call recording, and then you talk about the different types of questions that you can ask to work the room of your reps to get them actually engaged and then we talk about how you layer sales methodology and the discovery trees that you've built on top of the tape review, which I thought was the most compelling part of this episode. So let's get into it. And folks, before we get into it, we are seeking feedback on these different types of bits. So we have interview episodes, and then we have Nick and Armand playbooks or Mark and Mondo playbooks or whatever you wanna call them. Them. So if you could shoot me a DM on LinkedIn and just let me know if you want more of the leadership interviews or more of the post solo episodes, it would really be helpful so we can give you guys more of what you want. I promise I will not take offense either way, whether you prefer the interviews or the playbook style episodes. You can either DM me or I think sometimes there's, like, a window that pops up in Spotify that says, give feedback to the host. We do read all of those too. And a three, two, one. Let's roll. Alright, Armond. Welcome back to the leadership show. You hopefully remember we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Number one, tale of the tape. If you are reviewing a tape, don't just start the discovery call. The first thing you should do is you should figure out what bucket this tape is in. So, for example, when I was at Pave, I would always have the rep bucket the tape into a below 100 employee hasn't run a compensation cycle prospect. 100 to 300 employee has run a couple of compensation cycles, or 300 plus employee growing and having compensation scalability issues sales cycle. And then from there, ask your rep to develop a point of view on what types of problems do we anticipate this prospect will have. And what that does is you give yourself a hypothesis going into the tape of a problem that you can prove or disprove instead of just wandering in every single discovery, assuming you're going to take the same blanket approach you take for every single prospect out there. Amazing. What's number two? Number two, three types of questions you can ask your team in a tape review. The first type of question you can ask is if the prospect goes on a rift, you can ask your team, what did we pull from the prospect's mouth that was important? Second type of question you can ask is what type of question should we ask them now? And then the third type of question you can ask is what did the reps say, and what might we have done differently, or what did we like? Those are the three.

If you are watching a thirty minute tape review, word by word and pausing, your tape reviews will take forty five to sixty minutes, and your team will get super, super bored. I challenge you, especially in a smaller one on one tape review setting, you can get through a thirty minute tape review in ten minutes if you are smart. Here's how you do it. First thing is you toggle to transcript mode so you can see the words without having to listen to everything. The second thing is you skip all of the rapport and you jump into the agenda. The third thing is you dig into the discovery, and that's where you're gonna spend the most time on the tape review. And then the fourth thing is you're gonna scroll through the demo, and if the demo is largely an 80 to 90% monologue, you do not need to review the demo. All you need to do is give them the feedback that they're not asking enough questions throughout the demo, and then jump right to next steps. So you check the agenda, you go deep on discovery, and then you jump to next steps if there's no meaningful back and forth in the demo. Why do you even do tape reviews in the first place, Arman? You've got so many other things on your plate as a sales leader. The reason it's important is you can explain concepts to reps all day. I can talk about the best cold call opener. I can talk about the way to set an agenda. I can talk about the right time to ask a question in theory. But then once you actually get into the game, there are a million ways people can screw up the timing of the question. So I might be teaching people how to ask certain story based question. I might say, if you want to turn a problem in a story, you might ask your prospect, when was the moment you realized that that was a problem? But if a rep asked that question at the wrong time, it's not a good question. The other thing is they can screw up the tone of it. And so by seeing your best reps time the questions the right way and time them with the right tone, it brings it to life for your team, and it makes it very, very real for your team. But it also allows you to make sure that your reps understand the context around the concepts. Yeah. Okay. So question for you is where are you actually getting the tape that you choose to review? Because your team is having all sorts of discovery calls, demo calls, etcetera throughout the week, but sounds like you're only reviewing one call and not even that entire call in there. So are you picking from your best performers to model off of them? Are you picking from, like, a mid performer to show some good and bad? Are you picking a dumpster fire of a call to give a ton of coaching and feedback? How do you choose which call, and then where do you actually get it? There are two ways that I will get calls, and then I'll cover what types of calls you should look for. So I used to be VP of sales, and I had a series of sales managers rolling into me. And so I would have managers running tape reviews with all of their reps on a weekly or biweekly basis. I wouldn't be running one on one tape reviews with all of these reps. I would have the managers bring the best tapes into my monthly one on one tape review with each of the reps. So every single month, I would do a tape review with the reps as well, so I could certify them and give them a little bit more one on one coaching and make them feel like this is an important part of the sales team ritual. So between those two rhythms, the best tapes would oftentimes float to the top. And so by the time we're actually watching the tape as an entire team, I've usually already seen the tape, or the manager has usually already seen the tape, and that also allows me to skip around and summarize much more quickly, and I know it's a good tape. That's the ideal way to get a tape. But the reality is that doesn't always happen. And so what I'll usually do in the other scenario is let's say we're really focused on asking impact questions or we're really focused on multithreading or really focused on nailing a certain competitor. I will ask the team or specific reps who are good for tapes related to that topic. I think there's some value in reviewing dumpster fire tapes. I think that value is best had in a one on one environment, not in a team environment, because sometimes your team will be picking up these really bad habits. And you'll have, like, SDRs in the room, and they'll be like, oh, this, like, mid market AE asked this question. And I oftentimes have to say, no, no, no, don't do that. And so let the big tape and tape reviews be the good tapes. And then for the small one on one tape reviews, then you can critique and have the worst tapes. Okay. So that actually brings me to this one other point, which is there's two types of tape reviews it sounds like you're doing. You're doing one where you've got your Friday team tape review, where you're picking one of the best calls of the recent period, and you're using that to model behavior for the whole team. Then what you're doing is you've got a separate rhythm where managers are meeting with their reps and they're reviewing that reps tape, and that might be a good call. It might be a bad call, but it is their call, and that's in a one on one format. Talk to me about the one on one format and some keys to success related to that, knowing we're gonna spend most of the interview on the big team tape review. Yeah. So the key is that, again, the manager is the one who's running most of the weekly and the biweekly tape reviews. And, ideally, they've been giving coaching to their reps every single week, working on the different focus areas of where they've struggled. And they're doing this in context of what I call the three levels of selling. And so this was our version of a certification program where we would essentially have three levels to selling mastery in any given domain. So, for example, the three levels to discovery mastery where the first level was, did you get the parts right? In other words, did you set an agenda, ask questions to find one problem, and did you set next steps using the five minute drill? Until you did those three things, I'm not gonna get all fancy and cute with the types of questions you can ask. Like, you you forgot to set an agenda? Like, the it's not even worth getting into the level two stuff. The level two stuff gets into the style of how you execute those things. And so did you time the question the right way? Was there a way that you could have softened that impact question? Could you have maybe leaned in with your tone a little bit when you were asking what would happen to their business if they weren't able to do this thing? That's your second level. The third level is the hardest, and that's the advisory level or the challenger level. And that's when you can get problems or you can get a self diagnosis from a prospect, but if they're wrong, you can actually educate them or push them as an industry peer, and that requires the parts mastery, the style mastery, but also the extreme industry expertise. And so every single month when I would do one of these one on one tape reviews with the reps, it would be their chance to be certified in the three levels of selling. And so I would rank them on the three levels in their agenda, in their discovery questions, and in their next steps. And they would imagine, like, a three by three grid, which is agenda, discovery, next steps, and then level one, level two, and level three. And then next month, they would get their chance to certify again. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. I know you have strong feelings on call scorecards. Would you use them for these calls? The answer is sort of I use call scorecards. So if you think about it, there are guidelines for how you should set a purpose, plan, outcome, agenda. And that was clearly outlined in that agenda row of the three levels of selling. If you have guidelines for how you ask discovery questions, I had those as well. Right? Did you get to level three business part problems? Things of that sort. And then I had the same thing for guidelines around the five minute row as well. And I had that in terms of did you do it at all? Did you do it with the right style? Or did you do it in a way that actually challenged the prospect? But from there, I I didn't have the 17 scorecard. I prefer to keep things simple. You know how I work is it tends to be everything can be broken down into three steps, and it is literally three parts of the call, three grades you can have. And from there, believe it or not, if you're doing monthly tape reviews at a team level, your managers get pretty good at calibrating this with their teams every single week. So let's talk about those monthly reviews at the team level because we've talked a lot about the stuff that surrounds these tape reviews. We're in the meeting now. Everybody's there. It's Friday afternoon. I got my iced coffee. You're ready to rock. Time to start the tape review. Give me some of the keys to success for this. So the first part is that point of view Mhmm. Or the tail of the tape. And so oftentimes what's happening is I'm driving screen share, so I'm usually the DJ on the tapes. And I say, mister or missus sales rep, tell me about this tape. Where did they come from? What should we know about them? And what problem do we think that they have? And they can tell me where to go on the screen. So I'll have reps being like, okay. Go to the close loss opportunity. You can see that we lost this deal in the past due to this. Now go over to their LinkedIn. You'll see that they're growing by this much. That means they're probably really hiring a lot, and they're talking about how much their equity is growing in their hiring narrative. And so I think that's one pain track that we could possibly go down. But what you'll find inside of the tape is that actually wasn't true, and that's usually when you click go. So give the rep a chance to build their point of view in public, and then let your team opine on that point of view and see, is there anything else that we would like to know about this prospect? Keep that really short. I'm like three minute POV. Get into the tape as quickly as humanly possible. If you're not on the tape by five minutes in, you are going too slow on your tape reviews. I'm running a thirty minute meeting on a thirty minute tape. So five minutes into the meeting, you gotta be in the tape, and that includes your point of view. I think there's a couple things about the tail of the tape that stood out to me, Armand. The first was actually you talked about in the top three takeaways in the beginning was the almost segmenting of what type of customer are we meeting with. You use the example of never done comp reviews before, have done them before, but they've only been through one cycle, and then far more sophisticated customer that's growing rapidly. If I think about when I was selling to law firms, selling to a SMB 20 person law firm using QuickBooks was very different than selling to a 50 attorney law firm was very different than selling to a 2,000 attorney law firm. And then the type of accounting system we'd be kicking out for that sale also inform the types of problems or focuses that they had. The type of law that they practice would inform the types of challenges or problems they would have, and you wouldn't be able to accurately assess a tape without understanding what type of prospect you were meeting with, and it wouldn't be helpful for the team if they didn't know that. But what you're also doing is you're pushing everybody to say, hey. This is the type of prospect we're gonna be looking at a tape for. What do we think is going on? And what that does is it trains the team. They might need to start doing that for all of their discovery calls. Go in with a perspective on the stuff that you are looking for. This is one of the biggest things I've learned from you related to discovery is you have to have a general sense of the problems that you are looking for, not just go hunting and hope that the prospect is going to volunteer a problem that your thing actually solves for. If I can add two things on this, the first is there are two types of information I will look from my team when they're going into a tape. The first is tell me a little bit about the persona of the company or the company archetype or the stage or the type of deal. That's gonna tell me the types of problems I think this company will have. But then the second thing that I forgot to mention is tell me about the person that we're meeting with and then the other people on the account. So if the company persona is telling me about the problems that I wanna solve, the people on the account tells me the process that I wanna follow. In other words, what am I gonna ask for at the end of this meeting? So oftentimes, what we'll do is we'll pull up the company LinkedIn, and and we'll be like, we're meeting with this director of compensation. At the end of this call, I wanna see, is Claire gonna ask for Jane, the chief people officer? And so we can usually call that upfront. And now every time these reps go into their own sales calls, they're thinking of how they can do this in their own deals. Should we start this thing? You are driving the screen share because you want it to be a quick, efficient, effective meeting. You talked about skipping some of the upfront bonding and rapport. You're using the transcription. You generally it sounds like you start at the agenda, or do you tell the rep do you have the rep tell you where to start the call at? I will usually just jump right into the agenda, and I will skim the rapport. And I'll be like, looks like you talked about some reasonably intelligent business rapport, not about the the weather, but I don't really need to listen to all of that on the front of the call. The first thing I'm doing is I'm usually going to the agenda, and I'm like, alright. What I'm listening for is purpose, plan, outcome. Play the tape. Did they come with a purpose for the call? Did they come with a plan for the call? Did they come with an outcome for the call? And did they come with one that was slightly tailored to what you knew about the prospect coming into it with your point of view? That's usually the first stopping point. And from there, the first question that I'll oftentimes ask the team is how'd the rep do? Or sometimes I'll even pose it to the rep themselves. It'll be like, knowing what we just covered in our POV, is there anything that you would do differently, or do you feel pretty good about it? That's the first question. Don't spend a ton of time on the agenda because it's pretty static and standard what you should be doing, but that's the first stopping point. So there's generally some back and forth between rep, prospect, rep, prospect. My guess is every single time the prospect says something and every single time the rep says something, Armand, you as the VP of sales are like, oh, I could stop and point that out. Oh, I could coach on that. Generally, how often are you stopping or what are the times where you're like, okay, it's worth me pausing versus just letting the tape roll even if there's something that you might wanna give feedback on? It's really frustrating when every single sentence is critiqued in the tape. The way that I think about it is if the concept has been covered before earlier in the tape review, then I will usually skip it. So if it's like story question, what question could we ask to get them to tell a story? You go around the room. Some people give you some examples. Great. You play the tape. They don't get the story. It happens again later in the call. I will usually summarize the takeaway at that point. I'll be like, and if you remember earlier, we talked about one way to get a story would be this. I think this would be another good time to use that. I'm not gonna go around the room right this second. Let's keep the tape rolling, but notice that this came up again. And so I'll call it out. I'll summarize, but then I'll keep moving forward through the tape unless it's a new concept. And that allows you to basically say, hey. You remember that thing that happened at the beginning of the call? Ding ding ding ding ding. It's happened four times throughout this call, but I don't need to have the entire team rehash and beat a dead horse on the same part of the tape review. So you talked about three main places that you'll stop or three main types of questions you'll ask. The first one was evaluate how the rep do. You had two others recap what the prospect said, and then you had another one which was what is the next question we should ask? Can you tell me about those two other types of questions you'll ask? Let's talk about this in the context of a discovery call. So we got through agenda. First question, why'd you take the call? Almost always listen up, folks. This is really important. Almost always, this is when the prospect will give their first important riff. So they'll say, why'd you take the call? Prospect will start saying, oh, yeah. We've always thought about doing total reward statements. You know, our compensation process is a little bit unscalable. It seems a little bit antiquated that it's on spreadsheets. We don't need to solve the problem, but I wanted to learn more. First thing I'm doing is I'm actually switching screens, and I'm pulling up our discovery trees. Whatever your sales methodology is or whatever it is, for us, we would have situation, problem, and impact. And so I would pull up the discovery trees, and I would be like, alright. Someone plot me on these trees. Where did the prospect drop us in our discovery trees? And did they drop us in a situation where they're doing comp planning on spreadsheets? Did they drop us right into a problem where they said our comp planning process is unscalable? Did they drop us into impact, which is we're losing tons of people because of our equity program? And so you can now take the methodology that you've already rolled out in your discovery, and before you just start peppering your team with random discovery questions, you can orient them around where the prospect dropped us in our discovery flow. And now this starts to get everyone on the same page together thinking about, oh, this is where we are in our discovery flow. That must mean the next question should be this. So you orient them on the flow, and then you ask the team, what was important based on what the prospect said. Where did they plot us on this tree? And then the next question you ask the team is, awesome. If we wanna pull them deeper into the trees or if we wanna pull them from situation down to problem, what's a question we could ask to pull them from situation down to problem? Damn it. That is really, really powerful. What I'm hearing is you're literally layering your methodology over the real world interaction that your prospect or rather your rep had with the prospect. And what you're doing is you're saying all of the theory, academia, whatever you want to call it, that we've been talking about and training on, let's actually pull this up and show where are we in this right now? What's actually going on? And that makes it far more real, and it helps orient your team around what might I need to do here. Exactly. The other thing that is really helpful here is a lot of people think discovery is a pure art. It's not a science, and people will come up with a lot of random questions. But this allows you to really taper what question do we want everyone thinking about. So let's give a a more tangible example. Let's say that someone dropped us into a problem, and they said, our compensation planning process takes a lot of time. I know that that's not a business impact that's gonna sell this deal. The business impact that's gonna sell this deal is our compensation process takes a lot of time, and we spend so much time in these spreadsheets that we're making compensation mistakes. And compensation mistakes are how you get written up in Business Insider. So, team, what question could we ask to get them from compensation takes a lot of time to compensation mistakes? And you're gonna hear all types of questions. You'll hear humbling disclaimers where you could say, I guess this is an awkward question, but is it alright? Or you'll get the rep that asks in a little bit of a cringey fashion. You'll get someone who tries to trade a story in exchange for a story. And so there are a million different ways you can navigate from problem to impact, and this is what allows your reps to develop their different styles of questioning is you might hear four different types of questions across the room that all accomplish the goal of getting the prospect from problem to impact. So what I'm hearing, this reminds me of something that I learned from Kevin Dorsey, where Katie says, you need to determine what you need the prospect to say. In this case for you, Armand, you need them to say, yeah, we are making mistakes with our compensation process. And then you work backwards and figure out if you know where you need to end up, then you can work backwards and say, then what am I going to ask? And so what you're doing when you layer the map of your methodology over the discovery calls, you say, okay. Great. They just said this, which means the next natural thing we need them to say is we're making mistakes. How do we just get there? And that makes it so much more practical. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kind of where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Okay. I wanna ask about some of the surround sound in these. So you've got a lot of reps in these tape reviews. You're generally driving. It sounds like the reps whose the rep whose tape is being reviewed speaks up a decent amount. You call on people occasionally. Are there other things you're doing to make sure that the whole group stays engaged? Whenever possible, I like to give the rep the chance to replay their own tape before everyone else jumps on. This doesn't happen for every single question. It's not, oh, rep asked this question. What would you have asked instead? Mister or missus rep who's tape reviewing. But as many times as appropriate, I don't want them to feel like they don't have a voice in their own tape. So I would say at least half of the time or maybe 40% of the time, I'm going to that rep. But the other parts of the time, I'm usually going around the room and I'm asking. Now the problem is you have some reps who are really, really yappy, and this is when school teacher me comes out. I will have to tell reps where I'm like, alright. It can't be Nikki this time. Nikki's given us some really good questions. Antoine, what do you think? Alan, what do you think? I will cold call reps, and I'll make sure that they're all engaged throughout the room. And this gets everyone to, like, actually pay attention. It is not just whoever speaks up, whoever raises their hand, and you would be surprised how few people were disengaged in these tape reviews because, again, we were skipping around a lot. They were short, and they knew they were gonna be called on, so they had to be locked in. One more question, and this sort of goes back to the sourcing of the tapes. Are you picking tapes where there's an active deal right now, or are you picking one where it's already closed, whether that was won or lost? It depends on the goal that you're trying to accomplish. So I think sometimes it's really, really, really cool when your team has closed a massive deal that you've been working for a couple of months. I won't name logos, but there was one time where we closed a 250 k deal, and it was a logo that everyone listening to this show would know about. And seeing how that first discovery call started with an at slash slightly below the line champion and how the rep multi threaded up in the first part of the sales cycle, it makes it just feel so much more real of you never know when you're when you've got a 250 k deal in your hands. That's more of, like, the celebratory thing. I think the more important thing is less, like, is the deal open, closed, whatever it is. The more important thing for me is is the tape focused on the skill that I need the team to build right now. The reality is you can run a phenomenal tape and close lost the deal. You you do not have to have a next step on the books for it to be a successful tape. You could have no next step on the books, and that could be the right thing if we've really been focused on dequeuing bad deals. There was one time where our SMB team was, like, chasing these 12 employee compensation deals for months. And I was like, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna review a bunch of 25 employee tapes as a team. And if one of them makes them over the line, there better be a damn good reason that this 25 employee tape is in our pipeline. And we actually just made it a point of pride for all of the reps to be comfortable publicly walking away from small deals. I mean, just even the public nature of modeling the behavior, I think is one of the biggest things I'm taking away from this because your team will follow the behavior you say this is what we wanna do. And for a lot of salespeople, they are afraid to tell any prospective customer even if it would be a you're buying a churn customer, no. Hey. I don't think this is a fit. I'm not gonna sell you this thing. But when you show them in a tape review, here's how you eloquently DQ somebody. All of a sudden people are like, oh, I can do that. And here's the best way to do that. Really powerful. Armand, we are running out of time. The clock is tick, tick, ticking. I I got to move to the final question, which is this. We've talked about great things people should be doing on tape reviews. I want to flip it on its head and ask you what is one bad habit that leaders have on tape reviews? Do you think they need to break so that all sales teams get a little bit better? Not keeping a hall of fame library of all of these phenomenal tape reviews that you're doing. Every single week, someone makes it into that team tape review, and it's a killer tape. Figure out the number one reason it was a killer tape and put it in your best multithreading tapes folder or best competitor x y z tapes folder or best enterprise tapes folder. When someone joins your team, have them watch one tape in every one of the major folders. If you're not documenting this stuff, what they're gonna do is they're gonna go into whatever call recording platform they have, and they're gonna go look at the most recent tape, and it might not be a good one. You're doing the work of combing through all these tapes, document them forever, and build your own hall of fame library. Really good. Arman, thanks for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It is time for a two by two recap episode from this episode on tape reviews. What do you have for your two? So my first one is you talk about layering your discovery tree on top of the tape. And so what you do is when the prospect finishes a riff, pull up your discovery tree and say, alright folks, where are we right now? Did they drop us into a situation? Did they take us all the way to impact? Did they mention a problem? Get the team to say where the prospect is on your discovery tree, and then ask the group, okay, where do we want to take them from here? What do we want the prospect to say next? If they just told you about a situation, you probably want to turn that situation into a problem and so get the group to say, here's what we need to ask to get there. It gets the team actively engaging and it makes your methodology or your discovery tree far more real. Takeaway number two that I had is you want these things to be punchy and efficient. That means you do things like you drive the screen share to keep the pace. You don't pause after every single prospect or rep riff only pause. If there's a big issue that needs to be talked about, you can skip the small talk, the rapport, go to the agenda, move quickly, use the transcript instead of the video as as a way to get through these things in less than thirty minutes. Number three, the tail of the tape. Never just blindly walk into a discovery call. Have your reps look for two things. Number one, what is the problem that we expect this company or this prospect to have? And then number two, who are we meeting with today, and who do we want to meet with after this call? And then lastly, number four, Nick touched on it, but I'm gonna hammer it home. Three types of questions you can ask. What did the prospect say that was important? What is the question we can ask this prospect after that riff? What do we think about what the rep said? Three places you can stop. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So we spent a little bit of time in this episode talking about the idea of a discovery tree or a discovery flow. And if that's not something that you've built, Arman, you were the one that taught this to me. I use this for my sales calls and it helps me get to problem and impact much, much more efficiently than I did in the past. If you want to build your own Arman, I know you did a deep dive right up on how to build your minimum viable discovery flow. There's a link in the show notes. Go check it out. I found it helpful. Maybe you will too. Thanks Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
