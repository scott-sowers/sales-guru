## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to the president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my co host, Mark Cosgrove. And today, we have Maya Conant. It is the first time we have ever talked about top of funnel forecasting, and this is with someone who is highly qualified to do that as the VP of inside sales over at Clari. Mark, why should people listen? I think you just nailed it. This is the foremost expert on forecasting, and she's talking about an area of forecasting most people are not doing right now, and we got deep in it. So let's go. And a hint hint. If you want to hear how you can make your SDR team forecast, you better listen. And a three, two, one. Let's roll. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. First one, pipe gen forecasting. Forecast both by dollars and by number of qualified opportunities and get it down to the individual STR calling a number every single week. Super important as you get that predictability in your business and accountability, Literally having them look at the conversion rate over last quarter and this quarter of meetings booked to qualified opportunities and then taking that math and calling, hey. I have so and so upcoming meetings on the books. 71% of them are likely to convert to qualified. Therefore, I'm gonna call x number of qualified opportunities for my forecast for the quarter this week. Also, really important to make sure you're doing it by dollar so that across the different segments with the different ASPs, you are getting really granular even too down to the product level. So, right, you know, hey. This product that is newer to our suite, this is the number of dollars we can expect so that those teams then are ready to support accordingly. You're the first ever person on this show to make an SDR forecast. I like where it's going. What's number two? Love it. The next one is the end of week four part review. So really important to start there. The very first piece is that you have to do the metrics of the week. Right? What changed week over week? Where how are you pacing? Which deals closed? How much pipe did you generate? The next is calling out shout outs of the top wins from the week. Right? These I do three out of four of mine are professional. Right? So and so closed this deal. So and so had a twenty seven minute cold call. Then I'll do a personal one. Right? So and so bought a house. So and so aloof. Didn't tell anyone. And then I do kudos to a cross functional partner. Super important to make sure that you're recognizing those. And then I fire people up for the next week with what to expect. Right? Rest this weekend. Make sure that you're coming into next week ready to do x, y, and z. Really important, I think, to end the week on a high note and then get people in the right mindset going into the following. I love it. Let's end this one on a high note. Maya, bring us through number three. Yeah. Absolutely. So this is one of my favorite in that career coaching starts at retirement. A leadership coach of mine told me that you gotta envision what your last career stop before retirement is going to be. And so literally, you start with that longer term career vision, right, so that you can work backwards. So a few examples of that are things like what motivates you. Right? How do you envision that final stop? What environment do you work best in? If you didn't have to work for money, what would you do? This really gets at your passion. And then from there, once you've kind of established that final step, you go to the shorter career term vision. So in the next one to say five years, what do you wanna do? And so that is then what opportunities maybe exist in your current role, your current company that you want to take advantage of and which direction would you like to start learning and grow your career and scope. Then you dive into your strengths. So this is the easiest part, right? What comes easily to you? What positive feedback have you received, around your skills, knowledge, behavior, any of that? What do people come to you for advice on? I think that's a really interesting one to think about. And then last finally, you end with the development opportunities. And so this is what's that gap to go? What skills or behaviors do you have room to improve upon? What are gaps you've noticed? Where maybe are people not coming to you for advice on? What constructive feedback have you received? And how are you gonna work on these? I'm ready to dig into my thirty seventh favorite topic, but might be climbing into the top 10 forecasting with SDRs. So, Maya, take me through it here. Okay? So you're going person by person, SDR by SDR in a forecast meeting just like an AE, and what are the numbers they're calling? Like, show me the rhythm of how they call it out. Is it just like four meetings, $23,000 in four weeks, or give me the rhythm. Yeah. So every single Thursday, the SDRs are calling so their quotas are in qualified opportunities. Number up, so not dollars. And so they are calling their quarterly number, and I make them do it starting the first week of the quarter when every single Thursday saying I'm not gonna get 15 qualified mutes. What they're doing then to get to that number, so it's not just aspirational, it is rooted in science, is they are looking at their last quarter and even the quarter before that, their conversion rates of booked meeting to qualified opportunity. So maybe they're at 60%, maybe somebody is at 71%, and then they are taking what they expect to book, also a number that they can seasonally look at from previous quarters, and calculating in that conversion rate to it to arrive at the number. So I tell people you should never be actually calling your quota unless that is what the conversion rate is telling you you're gonna get to. Because you mean to use that science of what's happened in the past to inform the future. Alright. So last three quarters, I've set 20 meetings every quarter, and my conversion rate is 80%. So I'm getting to 16 qualified opportunities per quarter. So I start, week one. It's Thursday. Costa goes up the bat on STR forecasting, and I don't have any meetings on the books. Am I just saying, hey. I booked 20 the last two quarters, so that's my forecast and my conversion rate is this? Or am I, like, using some other kind of science to understand how many meetings I might book? You're using the formula of quarters past if you have nothing yet on the books. And then as the quarter progresses, you're using those upcoming meetings and then the conversion rate based off of those. So it starts with the past to then start to inform the future. So I'm working with several companies right now, and it's interesting that you said you don't just call the number. You make them call the dollars. How are you guys looking at what I've always called size of prize? Or, like, I'm booked a meeting. How the heck do I know how much is it worth? Is that rev ops feeding me that? Is that something I'm learning in my discussions prior? How do I get that dollar amount right? Yeah. So the SDR is actually we don't have them forecasting in dollars. The AEs and account directors are the ones doing it in dollars. They're doing it based because they are the ones who are pricing the deals and making sure that they know approximate user accounts too. So they are taking approximate user accounts and knowing which products that they're gonna be including in those deals to get to those numbers. We do have, like, a calculator formula for them to arrive at that. That was created in partnership with DealDesk and RevOps so that they do have a framework to get to that exact dollar amount. So if I have no meetings on the first Thursday, I'm gonna look back know, however many quarters, and I'm assuming that's some report I can access in Salesforce or Clari and be like, okay. This is about what I do every quarter. Then I'm gonna look back and be like, alright. What's the average number of dollars? And then when I finally booked my first meeting, now I can use my one book meeting versus my conversion rate. And then Salesforce has my size of prize. Right? So I can start to say this is about how much dollars that I'll generate in pipeline based off my book meetings and then my expected meetings. Right? So the beauty of Clari, we actually have it in there already, so they don't even have to do that math. Right? Because we have dollar amounts to make it easy. Awesome. I'm super fascinated. And then so I'll say then every Friday, the managers roll it up. I'm a second line leader. So then the managers roll up, and they give me notes on it. Right? So they're getting really specific, like down to the person level. Oh, and they can also make an adjustment on their people. Right? Oh, wow. So and so is pacing ahead. I think they're sandbagging. I think they're actually going to get to 25. And so the notes are actually things that we think we should adjust and change or things that are coming up. Right? So we just released a board meeting guide that is bringing us a lot of hot MQLs. And so we think we've seen a lift over the past week, and therefore, we think we are going to book more meetings because of that new hot content drop or that today we had, like, day in the life of our rev ops leader, right, and how he uses the platform. Alright. So ding, ding, ding. We're about to step in the ring. Maya, you believe in comping SDRs at the qualified opportunity? You know, I was a frontline AE manager. To me, if I think about the overarching business, close one revenue is what we're all going towards people. And so the closer you are to getting that accurate, and this goes back to why we have SDRs forecasting too, is directly related to those actually qualified opportunities where there is an initiative. There is some type of budget. You do have a stakeholder already involved. And, like, yes, it is less in the SDR's power to get there, but it is better for the over overarching business as it relates to growth trajectory and getting to that point of revenue predictability. Yeah. I'm willing to be convinced because there are issues with the qualified meeting model where, for example, you can have issues where SDRs are just going and booking a bunch of meetings that don't actually convert to opportunities. Right? I have found that by having strict qualification criteria at the meeting level, it allows the SDR to focus most on what they can control. There are obviously criteria for what makes a qualified SDR meeting versus not. It's not just that any sentient being decided to show up for a call. The tricky thing is when you go from meeting to opportunity, an AE has to do a good job. And the reality is the number one AE versus the last place AE will convert substantially differently on a meeting. And so what happens is people want to muck around with the round robin or they get all upset because their meetings are going to the bad AE, and I tried to take that entirely out of the equation where SDR, your job is to book meetings of a certain level of quality with a certain type of persona, yada yada yada. Right? And once it crosses that threshold, it's over to the AE's court. And, of course, you can comp SDRs more for bigger meetings, for example, or I've even seen models where you, like, provide incentives for, like, meetings that power. I never did that personally, but I've seen other people do that. But I find that there were so many forms of heartburn that would happen with, a, the subjectivity for what an AE would bring into their pipeline, and then, b, the level of skill, AE to AE. But I'm also aware that even though I had meeting qualification criteria, there were some SDRs who booked better meetings than others, and that is a drawback. So I'm curious, Maya, what you saw and then also, Mark, for your take. I think what you just described to me is, like, the 1.5. Right? It's in between. Yeah. Because it's not just meeting the book. It's meetings book with all this criteria. Yeah. I think, to be honest, just having all the sales leaders, all of the AEs aligned on, like, what is a qualified opportunity, what does the look, talk, taste, sound like? And having that be crystal clear. And, you know, sound like, hello. Nowadays, you can with call recording and go listen to the meeting, and that happens a lot. And so often, we will go do that level of inspection too to make sure that we're hearing and seeing the right things. Yes. They're booking a demo with three of their colleagues next week. So I think we're also in a different era now, I'd say, where the level of rigor we can bring to understanding the quality of that meeting that happened is different than, say, it was even five years ago. Just to push a little deeper here, Maya, the downfall of the qualified opportunity comp becomes very murky to decide, did the SDR set a bad meeting or did the AE do a bad job? How are you resolving that discrepancy? Well, you can go listen to the meeting too. I totally agree with that, but that's not scalable. Like, you can't go listen to every call. You're gonna listen to three or four. That's not a big enough sample size. You're just gonna see what happened in those three or four calls. So, like, do you guys have a way of, like, teasing out where that is causing a problem? So there is AI now that is doing that for us, that is showing leaders, like, here are the ones that didn't convert and showcasing. And even the ability to ask AI, ask it, like, is this meaning qualified? And you can do that in plain form even within call recording, which is pretty new and incredible and surfacing so that it is scalable to leaders. I always thought that it's best to have my best conversators as early as possible in the conversation. I believe, in general, AEs have better conversations than STR, so I always try to move them getting into the conversation as early as possible. I think that's what the qualified op does, is it says, hey. Let's get the AE involved super early. I think when you do the qualified meeting, it seems like to me that you push the AE further down because now the SDR has to have more of a conversation to qualify the meeting for it to count. So I'm curious, Armand. Like, where do you think is the right place for the AE to start their conversation? The handoff point happens in the exact same place. I'm vehemently against SDR driven qualification calls, which is another issue. I think it makes sense in some spaces, but in many commercial, mid market, and even lower enterprise sales, I want that in the hands of an AE. And if it meets the basic criteria of the right buyer persona, someone agreeing to a problem within your ICP, yada yada yada. Right? And so the handoff point remains exactly the same. SDR cold calls, cold emails, books the meeting with a persona who says, yes. I agree to this problem based email that this is interesting. At that point, AE takes that first call. I'm saying that is the point. Like, in SDR, when that meeting shows up, regardless of if the AE can get the prospect to admit to a problem, uncover the paying. An SDR should know that they're getting paid based on the quality of meeting that they've booked based on firmographic and persona graphic type of details. But I was going to ask, part of the reason I have had issues with the qualified op method is because god knows organizations left and right struggle with what is versus is not an opportunity and making that extremely clear, consistent black and white, AE to AE. And so I'm curious, Maya, for you, you mentioned that it's pretty darn clear, and that is the problem to solve. I'm curious. How do you go about making the what is an opportunity conversation as objective as possible? What is your qualified op criteria? You literally have pretty detailed entry criteria and exit criteria of, like, there is somebody with buying power. You know, there is an initiative to solve for one of the problems that your technology is solving for. There is a way to identify a budget. It might not be, you know, Karim Dauer identified quite yet, but they've spent on this type of problem solving in the past. Right? Timing, we, like, don't have as part of that. We think that sense of urgency can be created when you get into the demo and you show them the power of it. So that aspect is in as standard with, like, other band qualification, for example, we don't spend time and energy on. I'm super curious. How does the behavior of an SDR team change when you're doing this? I'm sure you weren't doing it, then you learned some stuff, started doing it. Give me, like, a juxtaposition because I think there's probably a lot of people being like, I like this idea. But there's gotta be some behavioral change management stuff that people need to be a little bit cautious around or think about through. Like, if you were to go to a new company, Maya, what would be the big things that you would make sure you avoided or did? One of the things people think it takes a lot of time to teach them how to forecast and to actually forecast. It does not. It takes them five minutes to update their forecast once a week. Like the managers, it takes maybe fifteen minutes total to look at all their directs and do that. So, like, take that off the table and teaching them the conversion rate and how to apply that and do the math really simple and easy. I'd say it's the mindset behavioral change. It needs to be tops down. Right? So, like, the CRO needs to agree that this is a priority. And as it relates to getting a more predictable revenue business, you need to know where you're gonna end from a pipe gen perspective at the end of the quarter. Let's say that I'm doing poorly or the SDR team is doing well. How does this change how the SDR team approaches what's going on? Are they just more in the nose or a little bit more intentional of what's going on? Are people freaking out because my forecast sucks for the first eight weeks of the quarter? Like So fun fact. We just did this actually yesterday after our forecast call. You know, we identified there's three folks who are looking like they're not gonna hit, and they're calling that they're not gonna hit. And so we looked at their activity across the three of them versus everyone else. And their activity was in line or above everyone else. And so we said, great. Okay. We know it's not like an input problem. Right? And so then we looked at other factors related to, like, the segment they were aligned in, some of the changes we've made in that segment. And so we started to work backwards to realize, hey, we have some upcoming things that they should get a lift from, but you go to the inputs that you can control once you kind of identified where there are problem areas. Just to double down on what Maya is saying around talking about revenue, getting your SDRs in the muscle of thinking about revenue pipeline, all this stuff. I used to be an SDR leader. That is actually how I started. I went from AE to director of sales development. And oftentimes, what happens is when I say an AE closed a 100 k last month, feels real. If you say an AE generated 300 k in pipe last month. Still feels real, feels a little bit less real. You say an AE booked 52 meetings last month. Starts to not make sense to everyone. Not everyone knows what 52 meetings is. Doesn't feel good. Then someone says, marketing generated 3,072 MQLs, and the entire sales team has no idea whether or not they should be celebrating. And so to be clear, while I believe that SDR should be paid on the meetings, I think that the way that you talk about impact in the organization needs to be as close to revenue as humanly possible. And that's why I love this concept of revenue forecasting or pipeline forecasting with SDRs is you'd be talking about all these AEs that made presidents club, and then you'd be talking about these SDRs who did, like, 300 meetings in q two or something like that, and no one understood what it meant. And the best thing that you can do as an SDR leader is be like, hey. The sales were closed $2,000,000 of revenue last month. 700 of that came from these four individuals on the team, and that's how you start to make your inside sales team all feel part of the motion together. And so on this note of pipeline forecasting, I wanna segue to the other parts of pipeline because SDR is one portion of a company's pipeline generation. You have AE self source. You have SDR self source. You have marketing. You have BD referrals, all that stuff. Are you doing the same sort of pipe gen forecasting for all of the other parts of your pipeline as well? How do you build up the full 100% pie of how much pipeline you're going to generate this quarter? Yes. Absolutely. For the AE side, like, that is a dialed in week over week. Like, the AE account directors are calling a number. They have a target, that they're driving towards too. In tandem with their SDR, we've moved to an account team model, which has been tremendous and amazing. And so that, for sure, from the partner side, we now are tracking it. It's not as regimented as the week over week, but, yes, we are tracking exactly how much either sourced influence touched. We are looking at it week over week, just they're not, I don't think, calling a number per se or a a dollar value. And then from the marketing side of things, they actually have a number of MQL goal that they are working towards, and that is what they're being tracked against week over week. When you think about the different ways to forecast revenue, there's the bottoms up forecasting rep by rep, and then there's the tops down forecasting, which is the rev ops looking at pipeline, all that stuff. You can also say that there's a bottoms up forecast that you're building for for pipeline generation. So you have you're adding up all the SDR forecasts, the marketing MQL forecast, the AE, which is fascinating that you have AEs on pipeline, quotas as well. You can add up all those forecast bottoms up. But, historically, I've heard that pipeline forecasts are done more mathematically, top of funnel, looking more like top down at historical performance, and then also just looking at marketing's activities. So how do you overlay these two? Are you using the SDR, AE, and, like, bottoms up MQL forecast as your pipeline forecast, or are you using more of a mathematical tops down forecast or both of the above? We're using both, but we are really relying on, like, the bottoms up to tell us what's actually happening. But we also, of course, from a finance demand gen perspective, have a tops down. And because we can get so maniacal too with our own platform and our own product, to me, it all comes down to the visibility. If you're not looking at this in real time every single day, have access to it, everyone's aligning around the right data, then you can't get to that level of pipe gen predictability. Armana, so listen. I think that you have, like, the layer one of your financial plan. Like, there's a huge spreadsheet or in a plan worksheet or somewhere that basically says, we need to get this many meetings set by the STR team to be on track. Some version of that usually becomes the top down forecast along with a little bit of modeling on what's happened recently. Right? Then what I've always done is the bottoms up forecast then tells me if I'm on pace for hitting the tops down. And so what I'm trying to find is the delta. If there's a delta between the bottoms up and the tops down, that's my frontline manager's job to reconcile that delta. Maybe the delta's in the great direction. We we're forecasting higher. I need to understand why you would forecast higher than the model. If you're under, then frontline leaders, I need a program with a specific goal and timeline that allows us to close this gap so that the AE org isn't stressed next quarter when they only have 2.3 x coverage, when they need 3.2 x coverage. And I'll tell you one other thing is I've had this thing, that I teach STRs called three strikes and you're out. And at the end of a cold call, on the third objection, listen. Get the hell out of there. Alright? Don't keep like, there's all these people keep pushing them. Come on. Alright? Three strikes and you're out. But how you leave the batter's box determines whether you get to go back in or not. What I mean by that is on the third strike, on the third objection, I teach my cold callers to say, you know what? Sounds like you're right. Sounds like now isn't a good time, but things are always changing. I'm gonna keep in touch with you via email. And if you don't mind, I'm going to call you in thirty days. I wanna put something on your calendar for five minutes just to check-in to make sure nothing's changed. Is that cool? 50% of people will say yes. Most SDRs will enter the next month with double digits of these little meetings booked. And guess what happens? They're high converting because you're showing your partnership. You're showing that you're good to your word. You're not harassing people. And my daughter, who was an SDR, could convert 70 to 80% of those pre booked meetings into actual meetings, and that's when she became the number one SDR at Outreach. It's because she was now booking her own pipeline for meetings in the future rather than just always having to rely on, is somebody gonna pick up the phone today? And so I would say, like, I found it's really strong to forecast that SDR performance when you can look at SDRs and be like, look at all the meetings that they've booked in the future in order to book meetings, then we can capture that conversion rate. So that's something that I found that makes it very helpful to forecast this pipeline for SDRs. Love that. Good for her. Amazing. She's dope. Dad brag. We're writing the book on cold calling, and and I'm gonna add that to it, courtesy of Mark Cosclo. Maya, this was so good. And, honestly, I've personally never talked about SDR forecasting, top of funnel forecasting within a sales org. And so this is a fascinating episode for me personally, but we have to move to the final question. So, Maya, we've talked about a lot of good habits, especially around top of funnel, and now we need to talk about a bad one. And so if there was one bad habit that every sales leader out there should break today to make all teams a little bit better, what would that be? I'd say that it is related to overpromising from a career trajectory perspective. I think a lot of people want to be hopeful about their people getting them promoted, But, you know, we should divide the conversations between reality and aspirational a bit. And I've worked closely, for example, with my talent partners on, like, having them to be the bad guys, so to say, in in the sense of being more realistic and helping in that. Completely agree. So everyone, hang on. If you want to get promoted, just listen to the recap coming up soon. Cheers. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alrighty, folks. It is time for a two by two recap. Mark, what do you have for your two? Two by two. Number one, booked meetings over the last two quarters times conversion rate over the last two quarters equals my early quarter forecast for SDRs. And then as we start to book meetings, we use those same numbers and and start to whittle away a quota. I really thought that was good. And then lastly is there's a top down financial plan. There's a bottoms up forecast. We use that to calibrate the SDR team on exactly what they need to attack to hit their number to make sure we don't put pressure on the AE team when they walk into quarters with low coverage. Number three. I love how everyone has to forecast. Marketing has to forecast top of funnel. SDR has to forecast top of funnel. Even the account directors were having top of funnel quotas, and all of those roll up into one big bottoms up forecast that tell you if you're gonna hit your number in three months before you're forecasting revenue. And then lastly, number four, one way you can make SDR forecasting even easier is if half of your meetings are already on the books. So this was a Marc Casaglow special takeaway, which is how you leave the batter's box matters. What you can have your SDRs do is after the third objection, tell the prospect that, hey. I'm gonna give you a buzz in thirty days if that's okay, and have them send a five minute hold as a reminder, and they will enter the next month with half their meetings already booked. Alrighty, folks. So if you like this one, we've been writing about some more leadership stuff on the 30 Newsy. Once a month, give or take, I try to throw some leadership content in there. If you're a leader, you can also just send all the sales content to your teams too. So go to 30 backslash newsletter. You can check out all the stuff we've written. And if you'd like, you can subscribe as well. Peace out.
