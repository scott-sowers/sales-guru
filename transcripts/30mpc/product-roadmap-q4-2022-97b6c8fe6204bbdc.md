## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this, not this episode, not this playbook, but this roadmap episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Zagelski. And as you guys know, every single quarter, we drop a roadmap episode that includes two things. Number one, here are the new products or the new things that we're doing out in the space. And then number two, what's our quarterly content roadmap? In other words, what are all the tactic tear downs, the podcast episodes, the tactic tool kits that you all can look forward to every single quarter. So, Nick, why should people listen? Well, this episode is sort of like when October 11 hits. October 11 isn't a particularly special day except it's only twenty days away from Halloween, and you start to get that excited feeling in your stomach. And we are hoping that this episode does the exact same thing. It makes you excited for all of the gifts and candy and sweets coming from thirty minutes to president's club. And, Armand, I'm gonna let you do the honors. I'm a little bit too too humble, I think, to share some big news that happened to me recently. Okay. So part one, here's what's new in the world of thirty MPC. Nick is too humble to share this, but he got a new job, folks. So congratulations to Nick. And you might be wondering, where does mister prince of sales, the coldest caller in the game, where does this man find a job? Well, I'll tell you, the company has amazing, really good looking leadership. They also have amazing perks like being able to expense double guacamole portions and then even finish the portions of your fellow colleagues. And then lastly, they have an inspiring mission to help sales reps around the world get better at selling. And so Nick Sigelski is officially the first full time employee of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. Congratulations to you, my friend. You have a really angry boss over there, but I'm very proud of you. Why don't you tell folks what this actually means for them? So what this does not mean is that I'm going to turn into a podcast host who doesn't really know anything about sales. The two things that I am going to be doing as a full time employee of thirty minutes to present his club is one, selling our sponsorship deals. If you actually listen to the beginning of the show, all of those sponsors and partnerships that we have are because I'm out there cold calling and cold emailing and setting up arrangements with these sales tech companies. So I'm still gonna be in the game. I'm still gonna be selling. I really, really, really do not want to become a talking head who doesn't know what I'm doing. The other thing you're gonna get from us is for the past two and a half years, everything we've done with thirty minutes to presidents club, Armond and I have done on nights and weekends. And believe it or not, I've learned a ton of stuff about best practices for cold calling and negotiation. And I get a lot of messages from people saying, hey. Like, are you ever gonna put together, like, a master guide on everything you've learned? And this now unlocks the ability for us to do that by me having just the focus on everything thirty minutes to president's club. So I'm gonna be selling this, and I'm gonna be creating more 30 MPC content. So I'm pretty excited, man. And just to double down on that point is one of the things that's made 30 MPC successful is we've interviewed a ton of people who have a really big name on LinkedIn. For example, they might be a sales trainer. They might be a big sales leader. But we're gonna be honest. Like, right now, we have an amazing following, and some of our best guests ever actually have never posted a thing on LinkedIn. And so in our commitment to be the world's most actionable sales podcast, what we're doing is we're reaching out directly to leading sales reps or top sales reps at top tier companies who have never posted on LinkedIn and trying to find some undiscovered talent. In other words, who's making president's club that's not really talking about it out in the world. And that's our commitment to you all to make sure that every single podcast is hyper actionable and hyper tactical so that we're always staying super relevant in the space. And so we've got our guests, we've got our employee, but a lot of this is talking about the things that we do or the things you can hear. Nick, what about the things that you can read? Well, if you don't know, thirty minutes to Presidents Club, amalgamates, I think that's the word, we put together all of the stuff that we learn every single month, and we actually share it in what you might call a newsletter. And it comes from boring emails at thirty minutes to presidentsclub.com. And I'll be honest, neither Arman and I really have any swag or aesthetic or style. And so when we launched our newsletter, we said, you know what? Let's just send out a plain text email of everything that we've learned. And the problem was we kept learning and learning and learning more stuff, and the newsletter looked pretty darn ugly. And, Armand, I know you've been doing a lot of hard work to make it look better, feel better, be more easily digested just like that guacamole that I'm eating. So you all are gonna see we are going to be tinkering with the format and design of the newsletter, and that is to make things as easy as possible for you to understand the actionable stuff that thirty minutes to presidents club is learning and then distributing. So note, if the newsletter looks different every single month, that is by design. Pun intended. There it is. And so that's what's new. So let's talk about what is to come with the q four content roadmap. So, Nick, why don't you lead us off? Because our first ever tactic toolkit, Charlie Johnson's cold email drip exploded. Thousands of downloads, tons of people are using it out in market. And again, if you haven't gotten that already, go check out the link in the show notes. You can steal Charlotte Johnson's cold email drip entirely. But for q four, we got another tactic toolkit that people can steal. Would you please do the honors and tell the audience what that thing is? Well, if you think, think, think about what's on the other side of the coin of a cold email, Yes. That's it. It's a cold call. And so we are gonna be partnering with the wonderful, illustrious Sarah Brazier to steal her cold call script. So if you wanna learn how Sarah opens cold calls, how she explains what she does in a way that the customer says, you know what? I actually would like to take a meeting with you. If you wanna learn how she handles objections on the phone, we are gonna be putting together a master guide on that with Sarah. So keep your eyes out. Keep your ears open. Keep your phones ready cause you are going to become a cold calling machine. And so we're gonna be continuing our live tactic teardown series. October, it's a cold call review with me and Sarah Brasure. November, cold email teardowns with Arman and Kyle Coleman. And then December, a live negotiation role play starring Nick and Arman. And so as always, folks, if you wanna sign up for those in advance, we always tell you what's coming before it's coming. Go check out the show notes. And guess what, team? It's a little bit sad because in between now and the next time we have a roadmap episode, we're chowing down on Reese's Pieces and Sour Patch in Halloween. Y'all are gonna be 20 pounds heavier from eating turkey and cranberry sauce and gravy, and Nick will eat all the stuffing as well, and so he might be packing a little bit more heat the next time you hear from us. And then of course, the next roadmap episode is my personal favorite one. It's the holiday edition of the roadmap episode coming at the end of the year. And so folks, we got Nick full time. We got a new newsletter coming. We've also got some new hidden guests coming. And of course, we got some killer content as always coming in q four. And so Merry Christmas to all, and to all have a wonderful 30 MPC night. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes.
