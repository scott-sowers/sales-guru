## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Armond Farrokh. I'm here with my co host, Nick Skalski. And today, we have the CEO, yes, the CEO of Connect and Sell. They created, if you didn't know, the twenty seven second breakthrough script that many of us use. Nick, why should people listen? Well, I thought I knew how to use the phone as a great tool to set meetings, and then Chris blew my mind with a ton of other strategies. One of my big takeaways here was how to avoid certain death on a cold call by getting categorized. Stick around, folks. 27, 26, 25. Roll the tape. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Chris. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Yeah. Well, number one is talk to everybody on your list. Don't prejudge anybody before you talk to them. The only thing that reveals the truth in sales is conversations. And if you don't have a conversation with somebody and you think you know something about them, you are merely being arrogant, unfortunately, you're also being stupid because your number one problem is not selling to somebody. Your number one problem is not talking to somebody and then not selling to them. It's simply not selling to them. So the best opportunities will slip by if you fail to talk to everybody on your list. Number two is actually a don't. Don't do pre call research before a cold call. It will kill you. Pre call research waste time, and it puts you in the wrong frame of mind. You need to be taking that person on a psychological journey, primarily made of emotions, taking them from where they start, which is their fear of you, believe it or not. Not your fear of them, their fear of you. And you need to take them through trust, through curiosity, through commitment, and to the action of taking a meeting. And number three is don't sell anything but the meeting in a cold call or a follow-up call. Until you've had the first meeting, don't ever sell anything but the meeting. And you need to know, to do that, what's in that meeting that's of independent value for that person. I mean, independent value is independent of buying your product. So if you're like a dog trying to get through a bone, through a chain link fence, you need to recognize the gate is over there. The direct route will get you bloodied, and you will accomplish nothing. You need to back up, calm down, and just sell the meeting. So how do I just sell the meeting without telling anybody what I'm actually doing here? Well, the way you sell the meeting is through two things that work together. So one is you have to recognize you're in a psychological situation. It's like a hostage negotiation. The main thing that's going on is feelings. And so Chris Voss taught me this. The author would never split the difference, how to negotiate as if your life depends on it. And I asked him once, how long do we have to get somebody to trust us in a cold call? How long do we have before it's too late? Like, they'll never trust us. And he said, seven seconds. He didn't say, like, well, let me think about that a minute. He said, seven seconds. Thankfully, I asked him a a follow on question. Chris, what do we have to do in those seven seconds? He says, oh, that's easy. I said, what do you mean that's easy? He says, that's easy. All we have to do is show that other person that we see the world through their eyes, we call it tactical empathy, and demonstrate to them we can solve a problem they have right now. And I said, well, wait a minute. Isn't the problem they have right now in a cold call me? And he said, yeah. What do you have people say? I said, do we have them say this? Hey. I know I'm an interruption. Can I have 27 tell you why I called? And he thinks about it. He says, it's perfect. I'm going great. Perfect. I seek free consulting over bourbon after dinner, and I get nothing. I get perfect. I wanted a nice correction from the master. He says, no. No. No. It's perfect. He Says, here's the deal. When you say in that hard flat voice hammering the word no, I know I'm an interruption, you're saying clearly you see the world through that person's eyes because they know you're an interruption too. It's not that I'm interrupting you. It's I am an interruption. I am a bad thing. They see you as a bad thing. You need to say it before they can. Get it off the table. So that's tactical empathy. You see the world through their eyes. Then he said, you changed your voice to a playful, curious voice. Now that's a technical term in FBI hostage negotiation parlance. It's a playful voice, and it it evokes curiosity. And he said, you made your voice go up twice. Can I have twenty seven seconds to tell you why I called? And you used an odd number. I said, like odd, like twenty seven isn't twenty eight or 26. He says, no. 27 is a weird number. If you say thirty, you're alerting them to the fact that you're up to something. But if you say 27, you're being precise, and you're getting them to be curious. So change your goals as a salesperson and your approach from value then trust to trust then curiosity then commitment, then the action of attending a meeting, defer all value discussions until the person comes to you. When they come to you, they're in a psychological state ready to listen to what you have of value. When you ambush them, they are not. Chris, let's talk about the next piece in that journey. Right? We've done the I know I'm an interruption. Can I get twenty seven seconds? They say, alright. Fine. Go ahead. Alright. You got twenty seven seconds. I'm starting my watch. Right. By the way, you blew it. It's not can I get twenty seven seconds? Can I have twenty seven seconds? Okay. So I Word for word. Word for word. This thing was crafted like you would not believe. This is not an accidental pile of this is not a word salad. Okay? So, yeah, now now where are we gonna take them? Well, we gotta take them to curiosity. And how do we get them to curiosity? We say the following. Nick, I believe we've discovered a breakthrough. So that's what we say. Why do we say that? Well, first, we say the person's name to get their attention pay attention. Then we say, I believe to get them to really pay attention. Because when you say I believe and you hammer, I notice the I and I believe is exactly the same as the know and I know I'm an interruption. The I and I know I'm an interruption is light. I know I'm an interruption. The I and I believe is I believe. Believe is light. I is hard. And then you've gotta talk about something that gets them to not push back. Well, you know the most neutral thing that can happen that's positive? Luck. You discover something. You're lucky. Everybody likes a lucky guy. So I believe we've discovered a breakthrough. Notice discovered is soft. I believe we've discovered a breakthrough. Breakthrough is hard. Why? Breakthroughs are all positive, and they all engender curiosity. Then we're gonna channel that curiosity into three channels, but we're gonna do it with a story. Our problem with talking to humans is they can't do anything but understand stories, And there's really kind of only one story. It's called the hero's journey. And the hero's journey needs, guess what, a hero. And the hero of this story is the breakthrough. I believe we've discovered a breakthrough. The breakthrough is gonna go on a journey. Well, so what does a hero do? It goes and slays a dragon and brings back the gold. So how many heads does a good dragon have? A great dragon's got three heads. Once you understood that, you were gonna do okay. Head number one is economic. You have to say something that'll make him curious about time, risk, or money. Making money or saving money. Number two is emotions. There's only one safe emotion that you can always go to, which is frustration. Everybody in business is frustrated because they wanna do well. In fact, they're motivated according to w Edwards Deming who taught us the people work for pride of workmanship. Well, they're frustrated by everything that keeps them from taking pride in their workmanship. What's that next thing? Strategy. Where are you trying to go? What's keeping you from getting there? But if I say to you, Nick, I believe we've discovered a breakthrough that completely eliminates the waste and the frustration that keeps your best sales reps from being effective on the phone or even using the phone at all. And the reason I reached out to you today is to get fifteen minutes on your calendar to share this breakthrough with you. And you say, you know, not only do we not use the phone, we would never use the phone. In fact, we hate the phone. In fact, our whole business is based on people walking up to us in the street and and recognizing us and shaking our hands. And if we do anything else, we're screwed. I go, great. No meeting. Wonderful. You know? No. I wouldn't. I'd make them go to the meeting anyway because I think it's good for them, but that's just me. You do have to have a a mental framework, a point of view when you go to to say these words, and it has to be this. You have to believe in the potential value of this meeting that you have on offer for this human being that you're talking with if they never do business with you. If you think this meeting is a stepping stone to get to where you wanna go, you're insincere, and human beings smell insincerity like wool, smell fear. Naturally, after you you gave that riff, I was like, well, what do you do? And you were saying earlier, don't sell anything but the meeting. And so what do you do when people are like, alright. Like, you you gotta tell me what this breakthrough is before we get on the meeting. Like, what do you actually do? The death move is to say, here in fact, I can do it in script itself. So I'll do it in the connect and sell version, but you'll be able to map it. I believe we've discovered a breakthrough dialing technology, and then I go on with the rest of it. I'm dead. Why am I dead? This person's just been ambushed. They're not ready for a category explanation. The reason they asked so, you know, so tell me more. This is I call it the Venus flytrap. It's my favorite objection. It's so bad that most reps will fall for it and think that they're doing great. So, Nick says, so, Chris, tell me more. And here's what I say. You know, we've discovered the hard way that an ambush conversation like this isn't a fair setting to talk about something this important. Are you a morning person? How's your Wednesday? Now when you finish with that, you you've changed the context to them as a human being. You care about them. You care if they're a morning person or not. Now they could come back and say, no. I really need to know. And you can say, you know, I found out that every time we go into that, I just end up confusing the person I'm talking to. This isn't something that we can even talk about reasonably in a few seconds. I have another call to make. How's your Wednesday? You're gonna have to ask for the meeting three times. You're gonna have to insist on the meeting, and you would only insist on it if you believe in it. The point is what value are they likely to get from this meeting that has nothing to do with them buying your product later. And you better have one economic value, one emotional value, and one strategic value. Strategic means we're trying to go somewhere. So a connect and sell meeting. You come to a connect and sell meeting, I guarantee you, you're gonna get this value. Do you ever go with connect and sell even at the level of a test drive? Frankly, I don't care. That's not my business, not mine to prejudge. And if I prejudge it, I'm really saying this is for me, not you. Chris, I wanna talk a little bit about one of the first things you said in this interview, and I think that's tied to the, prejudging piece you just mentioned. You talked about no precall research and no prejudging. And we've had people on here who are like, you gotta do a ton of research and make sure you know that person and know their business before you call. And you've got the opposite, stance on this. And so I'm wondering if you can talk about that a little. Yeah. It's a really good idea to be confident that they're a human being before you talk to them. So, fortunately, nonhuman beings well, they answer the phone 21 out of 22 times a nonhuman being answers called voice mail. Right? I don't care if it's a recording of somebody or not. It's still nonhuman. So if you could use something like Connect and SALT to flush out the nonhumans, it'd just be left with the humans, and then the humans who are on your list, that's pretty good. But once they're a human being, you have a pretty good shot at getting trust and then curiosity and then commitment and then action, having nothing to do with knowing anything about them other than that they're a human being and that they might be interested in your little breakthrough. So precall research will lead you to take a guess. Hey, Chris. I see that you went to Arizona State University. Go, Sun Devils. Really, what you don't see is that that was an expedient after three years at the University of Arizona, far away down in Tucson, where I had a very intimate relationship with the school, and I had kind of a cold relationship with Arizona State. And so you don't you can't tell that from the data, and that's simple. But you got it wrong, and your guess let's put it this way. Your chances of guessing right for a cold call are zero, and your chances of getting it wrong are about ninety nine point nine percent. That is emotionally. And now there's another kind of research you could do. You go, well, that's okay. Let's see. Let's let's try to figure out something else, something about the company. Let's guess it as to what their pain is. Well, we're doing that. Right? We're doing it with something emotional and something economic and something strategic. We're just keeping it at a level that has something to do with being curious, not giving somebody a lecture about how great we are. But the point is when you think you know too much, you screw it up. It's a human being. That's all the precall research you need. The rest of the research is gonna happen in their response to the breakthrough question, the breakthrough sentence. And it's gonna be this. If their response is tell me more, you should have the meeting. Don't tell them more right now. Just, you know, insist on the meeting. If their response is, what in the world are you talking about? Do you know what we do? Say frankly, no. I actually don't. Tell me and let them tell you. Right? Just be honest. You don't. It's okay to call somebody without knowing what they do. That's okay. That's not like there's no religious injunction that says I have to know what you do before I call you. So, Chris, I wanna go back because a lot of people talk about, quote, unquote, handling objections. And a lot of times, you're saying, fine. We don't have to have the meeting. But let's say someone hits you with the one of the most common ones, which is like, hey. I'm not interested. Are are you just going, okay. Hang up. Next one? Or or are you handling them? Well, I'm not interested in what? It's a it's a simple question. What are they gonna say? What they're really saying is they're trying on the we're set objection in a soft way, and the we're set objection is the one that's the response to the insult. So they heard in your tone that you're taking a a point of view that says I have something that you need to know about, and I know about it and you don't. I'm superior to you. And they say, I'm not interested in order to kinda push you away because they want out the other door. You offered them a twenty seven second way out the door. Remember, in twenty seven seconds, we're done. Right? But they're trying for another exit. Oh, and by the way, the problem that the person has is they have to maintain their self image while they're saying no and getting out out of the conversation. So this is a way to do it. I'm not interested. That wasn't really the question. I didn't ask if you were interested. Ask, you know, can I can I have 15 on your calendar? The reason I reached out to you today is to get fifteen minutes on your calendar to share this breakthrough with you. You're not interested in this breakthrough? What is it about this breakthrough that's not interesting? Is it that you're not interested in the waste that's associated with people using the phone? Are you not interested in the frustration of somebody like one of your reps doing whatever they're doing? I think they're dialing to nowhere over and over and over. Or are you not interested in being able to use the phone at all in your business? I mean, I wouldn't ask them that, but that's what's in my head. But let them talk. Just ask them, what is it you're not interested in? Because, by the way, as soon as the prospect lies, they lie for psychological reasons to defend themselves. That means they're defending themselves against the fact that they're about to say yes. So don't accept the lie because that's a lie. I'm not interested. It's truly a lie. It is that rare case. They're they come on. Really? You're not interested? Maybe you're busy. Right? But you're not interested? I got a sucky breakthrough statement. By the way, people marketing people will construct breakthrough statements that are so sucky that, legitimately, you could say I'm not interested. Chris, one of the other things that you talk about is the importance of having a conversation with somebody, and I think the words you use are a high impact conversation, before you ever leave them a voice mail. And what I always got taught as a new salesperson is, like, you leave a voice mail every single time when you direct them to the email that you're gonna send them. And you have a different perspective on this that you need to talk with them first. Can you talk about that? Sure. There is no way to get somebody to trust you through a voice mail. It's impossible. Can't be done. They know it's a voice mail. You know it's a voice mail. Everybody knows the recording. They're listening to a recording. Nowadays, they're listening to it while watching a little thing go along the screen. They may be reading a transcript of it that's all garbled and full of garbage. They are not going to get you to trust. You the problem with leaving a voice mail is you've given up the opportunity to have your first interaction create trust. If you wanna succeed in sales, you have to start with trust and move to value. And in this case, you're trying to start with value. Now Sandler will teach you techniques to leave voice mails that are pure curiosity voice mails and will get somebody to be curious without trusting you, and they might call you. But they might have called you more twenty years ago or ten years ago than they will now. There's not as many callbacks on those kind of voice mails. There are some. Their techniques can work on a pure curiosity basis, and you're skipping the trust step and trying to put it in later in the first conversation. But let's face it. If you had the choice of having a conversation or leaving a voice mail, which would you do? You'd have the conversation. So why are you leaving a voice mail? Well, it's a desperate alternative to not having a conversation. But as a desperate alternative, it's a little bit weird because what you're really saying is, I don't think I'm ever gonna have a first conversation with you, at least not one that's not proceeded with the voice mail. So why am I doing this? Because I think I'm gonna fail, and I guess I gotta do something. It's just a fallback. I guess it's the I guess I gotta do something fallback. Same thing about emails in this particular context. What's the email? Well, I couldn't get you on the phone the one time I tried or the two, so, I guess I give up. Right? Chris, we hit a lot of awesome stuff. We talked about not doing pre call research, getting to trust before you even get to anything else on one of those cold calls. I really enjoyed talking about tonality with you, and so we gotta move to our final question here. And so the last question that we ask to every guest is, what is one belief that exists in the world of sales that honestly is a load of junk and needs to be ditched? Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. So I'll take one. There's a bunch of them, but here's one. The there's a common belief that we should qualify on cold calls. This is the single most destructive thing you can do to your company's go to market strategy because it invalidates your list. It basically says the effort you went through to put together a targeted list is completely wasted. And now what we're gonna do is take a rep's opinion for whether we should go to market with this particular customer or not. It's nutty. Anybody who's running sales or running a company who allows qualification on cold calls other than did they take the meeting or not is sacrificing their entire company strategy to the whim and the mood of a person that's being paid on commission. Don't do it. Beautiful. Chris, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? Well, our test drive is pretty fun. It's free for most companies. It's mind blowing. It's a full day of production of talking to tons of people. As Tony Safoyan, the CEO over at SADA Systems, said on his podcast when I asked him a question, didn't you guys make some money on your connect and sell test drive or some dumb question like that? And he and his VP laughed. And finally, the VP, Billy Front, said, Chris, we made tens of millions of dollars in those three hours. So given that it's free, and I was taught by somebody once that zero cost option should always be taken, it's kinda foolish not to take the test drive because it's a zero cost option. The other thing is if somebody wants to check out my podcast, the stuff that we've been talking about here, I think we fit all 67 episodes into this podcast, so don't really bother. But if you really like listening to me just go on and on and on and on as a prelude to reading the book, say you want this. I wanna be the one person who listened to every episode of Market Dominance, guys, before the book came out and you're that one person, go listen to my podcast marketdominanceguys.com. Awesome. Chris, thank you so much for coming on. Everybody, go check out Connect and Sell. It is a life and sales changing, I don't even know what you wanna call it. It's a game changer. Stick around for a sixty second recap from Arman coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Chris Beal include, number one, you gotta build trust right away in those first seven seconds of the cold call. The way Chris does it is he says, hey. I know I'm in an interruption. You gotta do something to build that trust. Number two, stop being a yogi and doing yogi language. Things that you say that might sound like, I I realize I may be interrupting your day. Don't use over formalities. Just break the pattern and earn the trust. Number three, stop categorizing yourself as a solution or a category provider or even worse, the leading provider of anything. Do not categorize yourself as a solution. Talk about the problem that you solve or the breakthrough that you've created. And then lastly, number four, you gotta have three reasons. Three reasons not why somebody should buy your product, but why somebody should take the meeting. What are they gonna know? What are they gonna get? What are they gonna be smarter about at the end of that meeting? Nick. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. How can people help us out today? So we've gotten a couple really nice compliments about our nice thirty minutes to presidents club shirts that Arman and I have been wearing in all of our videograms. And we're we're starting to wonder, would people actually wear these shirts if we, I don't know, sold them, Armond? So we're trying to do a little market research. If you like the shirts and you've seen them, go on LinkedIn. They're on every single Videogram we post. And if you would actually buy one so we don't waste our time ordering a bunch and then them sitting in my closet or something, I don't know. Send us a message and give us a heads up. Check you guys next week on thirty minutes of Presidents Club.
