## Transcript

What's going on, folks? It's Arman from thirty minutes to Presidents Club. I have an announcement that I'm super stoked to make. So, one, I will give you the announcement. Two, I'll give you some special goodies as part of that announcement. And then, three, there's gonna be a change to the podcast drop cadence. That's a good one. You're gonna get more stuff, and so hang on all the way to the end. Alrighty? So, if you don't know the one and only legendary Marc Casaglow, he is one of the best sales leaders in the game. Whether you are a rep trying to become a leader, whether you are a rep who just wants to learn how to coach yourself because maybe you don't have a great leader to learn from, or whether you are a sales leader like myself who's really just trying to master the game, it is absolutely ridiculous how there are no good resources out there for sales leaders. It's amazing. Like, there are million methodologies for selling deals, but, like, this whole, like, leadership world is like a bunch of super reps who just, like, backseat drive deals, and it's ridiculous that leaders aren't trained. So that ends today because Mark is officially launching his sales management operating system course with us. And I have learned more from Mark as a young VP of sales than I have learned from any other leader that I have ever worked for in the entire past. And literally, this entire course was just asking Mark, how do I not screw up my forecast? How do I run non useless DOR reviews? What could I have done to make my training stick better? I made three or four mishires. What should I have done differently? It is literally everything you could possibly need to be a sales leader in under five hours, and it will be worth every single penny you pay. But, also, there's a lot of free stuff that you're gonna get over the next couple weeks even if you don't decide to take the course. So if you sign up for the launch event down in the show notes, in a couple of weeks, Mark is going to be breaking down the entire course in sixty minutes for free. Sign up for the launch event down in the show notes. Mark is literally going to break down the entire course for free in sixty minutes, and you will get frankly more out of that than you will get out of most other paid courses. So that's number one. Number two, if you sign up for that event, you'll get early access to the course, and you'll get a preorder discount that is the cheapest this course will ever be. It is never cheaper than it is during preorder. And so definitely make sure that you sign up for the launch event, and that will get you early access. And then lastly, number three, the course is broken into three different parts. So it's Mark's sales management operating system. So everything from, like, his sales process to his forecasting process to his AE prospecting process. Then number two, it's his operating rhythms. How do you use, like, team meetings, one on ones, and other meeting cadences to hold people to the operating system? And then lastly, number three is the talent system. How do you, like, hire people? Mark has put together ten one page frameworks that break down literally everything inside of this course also for free if you sign up for the event. I'm going to read them off right now. It is your five stage sales process to close deals as an AE. It is your forecasting process to make sure that you actually land deals correctly, your deal review process, your AE prospecting process, section two, your training program, Mark's training program, your team meeting framework, Mark's one on one framework, his entire metrics dashboard that he uses to make sure his org is doing well. And lastly, in section three, you have his hiring playbook, so his entire interview guide and his sourcing guide, and then also his 30 AE onboarding plan. So literally, all of these things are deduced into one page each, so you can literally start taking action on them today, all for free, even if you don't buy the course. So go check out the launch event. It's down in the show notes. Or if you just go to, like, 30mpc.combackslashteardown, you should see our list of upcoming events, and you can go check it out there. Alrighty, folks. So there's gonna be a quick change to the drop feed cadence drop cadence feed on this feed, whatever. So you might remember a couple weeks ago, we decided to go all in on YouTube content, which is more like solo breakdowns instead of interview style. Kinda like this where I'm, like, sitting at a table, like, talking to you at the camera if you can see me. And, overall, the reception from you all has been, like, absolutely phenomenal. I really feel like this has been, like, some of the most tactical sales content we've put out in years because you can just cover one topic beginning to end in ten minutes versus trying to, like, pull it out in the thirty minute interview. So over the next four weeks, if you've seen us launch courses before, we always do four weeks of content related to that course. So every Thursday, we're gonna be releasing one module from the leadership course with Mark. So Thursday is gonna be four weeks of sales leadership. Then from there, on Tuesdays, we normally do interviews. We're actually gonna keep doing YouTube content. So we're gonna do even more. So you're gonna get your same Nick or me or other creators breaking down step by step sales tactics on Tuesday. So, basically, Tuesday, Thursday, you have solo YouTube style breakdowns, and then all of our interviews will slide to Monday, and we're mostly gonna be dropping Mark Hall of Fame interviews where it's some of Mark's best stuff or upcoming interviews that we haven't published yet with Mark. Alrighty, folks. So that is the update. And as always with any of these, like, more intimate announcements, if there are questions or certain topics that you would like us to cover in future episodes, please just send me an email at armond@30mbc.com. It's the easiest way to reach me. I literally my email. I don't know why I put in all these episodes, but a surprisingly low number of people email me with things that they wanna learn, and I'm always open ears. That's number one. And then two, folks, go check out the launch event down in the show notes. And you'll also see, like, a link to Mark's actual course page if you want more details on that. Alrighty, folks. Peace.
