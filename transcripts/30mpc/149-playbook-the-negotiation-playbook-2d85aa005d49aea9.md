## Transcript

Good morning, everybody. And welcome to this playbook episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have a revisited version, an expanded version of the negotiation playbook that we did way back when in the early times of 30 MPC. And the reason for this, folks, is especially when times are a little bit tougher, when the market's down, when the economy is crashing, you get pressured on price way, way, way more. But here's the thing. While the variables can be radically different in an economic downturn, the key mechanics of how you negotiate are really the same. And so we're gonna be talking a lot about how you go back to the fundamentals. And, sure, you might be at a 20% discount instead of a 15% discount, but we're gonna talk about how you make sure that you don't give away the whole farm. Nick, why should people listen? Well, you don't wanna give away the whole farm, Armand. You wanna keep the bacon. You wanna keep the eggs. You wanna keep the toast. Do you grow toast on a farm? I don't know, but let's get into this thing. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alrighty, folks. So the way this is gonna be carved up is we're gonna talk about things you need to look for before a negotiation starts. Then we're gonna say, hey. When you give price, how do you give price? Then once you give price, if they ask for a discount, how do you handle that and go back to discovery? Once you've gone into proper discovery, then you can start to align on a path forward. And then the final fun part is we'll talk about how you use options at the end if you get past the first cut to stop the bleeding and finish negotiations once and fast. Alright? So first of all, let's talk about what you need to look for before the negotiation starts. So neither Nick nor I love BANT. Okay? But it's one easy way to remember how derisked or not derisked a deal you have is. It's also a good proxy for understanding how much leverage you have in a deal. Okay? And the key thing here, folks, is you should actually enter a sales cycle where you should enter a negotiation, and you should know based on the conversations you've had so far if you're gonna have to discount or not. And that leverage is defined by a couple things. So let's start with the b part of Bant, which is budget. K? The first thing that I would look for is is this previously budgeted for, or are you having the fine budget? If they already know they're gonna buy something, k, you have much more leverage. The other part of b is are they competing with other quotes as well? If you are the only competitor that has met their requirements and it's budgeted for, you better not be discounting very much. The second piece of it is the a, which is authority, which is power. If I am single threaded, this person can kill my deal, and it can go down very, very quiet. But if I'm across the organization and up in the organization and I know there are multiple people pushing for us, I know that I have leverage in the sense that I don't have to discount because someone else isn't going to be happy if they don't end up going with me as their vendor of choice. The third part is need, and this is one is probably the most obvious of them all, but the bigger the problem, the more defensibility you have on price. And the last part is t, which is timeline. In other words, you shouldn't have to discount. If you know you are a vendor of choice, it's a big problem, you're threaded to power, and you know they have to do something about it tomorrow because they're launching a product or because they're trying to close their year or whatever other milestone it is. Okay? But if you're selling a product that is, like, a nice to have or there's no clear timeline for it or they could do it this month, next month, next quarter, now you may have to actually use commercial terms to create artificial timeline. And, again, that will continue to reduce your leverage. So it's a simple framework. It's bent. But if your greens across the board, that probably means you could find yourself in a no discount deal. If your reds and yellows across the board, you might be stretching into that 40% range in a market like this. Part of your preparation for that negotiation is you don't need a 47 negotiation checklist where you're you're doing hours of negotiation prep. But anytime you're walking into a call where you know there's going to be some negotiation, you should be doing a quick pulse check using Bant to understand, is this one where I can hold really, really firm, or is this one where I'm gonna need to bend a little bit? Because that's how you're going to then proceed and navigate that negotiation. Doesn't have to be a long labor plan, but any plan is better than no plan. So you show up on the meeting. You've got your nice polo shirt on. Customer comes on. You're going through price. Let's talk about how we deliver pricing to a customer because that's actually part of when the negotiation really starts. The way that you share commercial terms with the customer impacts downstream the rest of the negotiation. And so you have to make sure you deliver pricing in a way that is extremely clear and confident and that the customer understands. So one of the things you want to avoid, however, is getting into pricing way too early in the sales process. If you're on your first meeting with the customer and they start asking you about pricing information, you may choose to say, hey. There's a lot of complexity to how we put together the quotes. It would actually be far easier for me to give you an accurate picture of what this will cost in a conversation or two or after we have the demo or after I understand a, b, and c from you. The idea is early when you're trying to understand more about the problem and the gap of where they are and where they wanna get to, you don't wanna get into an extended conversation about pricing on your first call with the customer. Now when you get to the place when you're delivering pricing to the customer, there's a couple keys here. One, when delivering price, explain the structure of the pricing before getting into the number. You might need to explain, hey. Here's the product mix of what you're getting. Here's the billing terms of how we bill you. Here's the agreement length. You wanna get all of the commercial stuff on the table and then give the pricing information. If you try to do it backwards, what ends up happening is they get fixated on the number, and they miss all of the other information. So share the critical information, share the number, and then do the thing that's hard for me, which is shut up. So, eventually, you give price to these folks, and you stayed silent. And there are some times when people will just say, okay. Great. Sounds good. And in that case, we're not really gonna plan for that much today, folks. What you wanna do is you wanna not make an object for it, and you wanna make it seem as business as usual. And all you wanna do is slowly prod and poke about the deal process and say, like, awesome. Who do we typically need to get this in front of? Are there any other blockers that you see us from moving forward, etcetera? But, usually, that is not the pleasant reaction you get. Usually, the reaction you'll get is holy cow, that is way more expensive than I thought it was gonna be. In other words, they are going to try to get a rise out of you, and they're gonna try to rattle you. And in return, what you need to do is you need to put it back on them, and you need to act surprise and make it clear that their ask is the one that actually needs to be checked. Nick, what are some of the ways that I can actually do that? Well, if you're on a Zoom, don't forget the power of your facial expression here. You should look concerned. You should be posturing and portraying that you're you're concerned here. You must have messed something up if they thought this was gonna be so much less expensive, and this has never happened before. You're gonna be confused. Right? Oh my gosh. Like, I don't even know how they got to this number. The idea here is you are showing them with your face and your tone of words that, wow, I must have really screwed something up. I don't even know how we got to this place. And And so I'm acting surprised, but also confused and concerned and a little bit worried because, well, gosh, if this is where they're at, now I'm gonna push them away. And so this transitions to the next piece where I start to push them away. And I might say things along the lines of, gosh, I must have really screwed something up. Armand, if that is really where you guys need this to be, I might actually recommend that you work with competitor x or that you find an option where you guys take a little bit more of the work in house to get this thing solved because we're not gonna be able to get over there. And what I'm doing is I am pushing the customer away. If they are really needing this thing to be half as expensive as what my thing costs, we shouldn't work together. And I wanna tell them that right away. Because now what I do is I get them to come back to the table and take a step forward. Well, woah. Woah. Woah. Nick. Like, hold on. Like, let's talk about this. The intent here, push them away. And if they come back to the table, let's start to do some discovery. Remember, the customer came into this Zoom interaction expecting a quick and efficient negotiation, and you are not going to give that to them. You are going to drag this thing out and make them work if they get any sort of discount. And you do that by rerouting their negotiation ask back to a discovery call. And you're going to discover, hey. Maybe you should go with the other competitor. Oh, no. You don't wanna do that? Well, help me understand, like, where do you feel like this thing needs to be? One of the other things you can do is they've asked you for a price discount. They've said, we can't do that. Now ask what other reservations or concerns do you have around working with us? Because I need to understand the full picture of what's stopping them working with us. And it's probably not just the pricing. There might be billing terms. There might be other things. And I explained to the customer, I need to understand the entirety of what you feel like isn't aligned with what you need so that I can start to weigh those things and figure out if we even have a path forward. Alright. And so at this point, I've gotten the full ask. And if it's miles apart, what you need to do is to Nick's point, you've pushed them away and tried to get them to consider another solution. But now what I need to do is I need to get them to actually step back into a reasonable negotiation before I even negotiate. My favorite way to do this is to pull them up. And so what you'll say is, look, I just know we're so far off based on the 17 things you asked for. At this point, I can't even go back to my CEO or my sales manager or my VP of sales with an ask like this. Right? Like, I just I just I know what can get approved, and I'm I'm willing to work with you, but I just know we're too far off. So I guess, like, on that basis, is it is it fair to say, like, I I shouldn't even go back and and make a request knowing that this isn't gonna work? And almost always, you'll get a response that sounds like this. Sounds like, well, maybe you can do your best. Right? Or let us know what you can do. And what that shows to me is they're actually willing to play ball, and they were just anchoring us low. And now I need to turn the tables back on offense in the negotiation where I need to start saying, like, look. No. I'm not going to, like, go to my CEO and shoot in the dark. Right? What I need from you is look. This is what the process looks like. I've never seen a discount like this before. I've never seen a request like this before. I think you'd be an awesome customer. Between you, me, and the wall, we've got some room here, and we can work on some stuff. But I'm gonna have to put something on my CEO's desk and on finance's desk that literally says the customer told me that this gets it done. Because if I come back to you and they I ask for something else, they're gonna be like, get it out of here. This isn't the right deal for us. And so what I need you to tell me is you told me x y z were important to you. Right? What I need you to come forward with is what can we actually go towards, And it's not gonna be a 50% discount. And now you need to get them to take that step forward. And for the first time, this should happen ten, fifteen minutes into the call. For the first time, now we are actually negotiating. But we are negotiating with them taking a step forward first, not with you taking a step forward. I wanna add to what you said there, Armand, which is when the customer asks me for my best price, you don't have the authority to give them that is what you're doing when you say you have to go to your CFO or your CEO. You're saying the other person in my org makes the decision. And when I go back to them, if I go back to them two or three or four times, I'm gonna lose a ton of face at my organization. And so I need to know in one clear cut from you customer where you need to be. The worst thing that you can do is walk off that negotiation call with the ask being from the customer, give me your best price. Because you're gonna come back, and you're gonna have no idea if that actually gets it done. And that makes it easy for them. Your job is to make it painful for them. The key here is drag this part of the conversation out. Alright. So at this point, we've dragged it out, and it's finally time to start aligning on a path forward. K? So once they start to come forward with more reasonable asks, usually, I'll be like, hey. Before we even talk about any of this stuff, like, let let's talk about what what needs to happen to even make this case. We talked about, like, we need to have an option that you and I agree upon gets it done in one cut. K? But the other thing is, naturally, my team is gonna wanna know that this is gonna get done at the end of the month or the end of the quarter. Right? And what that means is you and I have discussed that x y z people need to sign off on it. We need to get through legal. It's gonna take us this long, yada yada yada. In other words, if today is the first of the month, can you and I commit to a full signature by the end of the month? Because if not, then we shouldn't even make this case right now. Right? And what you need to do is lock in the access to power that you need to get, the legal reviews that you need to finish, the security reviews you need to finish, and the ultimate signature date before you give anything upfront. And the reason for this is this gives you the right later on to rescind a discount if they slip on the timeline that you agreed upon before giving the discount. But if you say, great, I can give you a 30% discount, could you do this by the end of the month? You have zero leverage whatsoever. So always make sure that you get that first before giving anything. Otherwise, you're gonna have a deal slip, and then you're gonna give a prospect a terrible taste in their mouth because you tried to take away a discount that you never even got them to agree to a timeline on. So, Nick, I've gotten commitment on when the deal can be signed, who signs off on it, legal, the contract date, etcetera. And they're like, yes. I can get this done. Great. Now we need to start agreeing on what a proposal should actually look like. Nick, how do I go about formulating the proposal back? So one of the things that we've done a lot during this imaginary negotiation we're talking through is we've given the customer a look behind the curtain of, hey. Here's how we negotiate in my company. I go back to my CFO. And one of the things that a lot of sellers neglect to do is share with the buyer the things that they care about. If you are in a negotiation and the only thing that you're negotiating on is what the customer has asked for, you're actually just giving concessions. You're not really negotiating. And so it's on you to share the things that matter to your company. And so what you should do is make a list of what are the things that your company cares about in a negotiation. It might be timing. Your operations team needs to plan for when new deals are gonna come in so that they can implement and onboard those customers. It might be the total number of licenses they buy. If they move from buying a 100 licenses to 200 licenses, chances are there's an economy of scale, and you could give them a better unit price for those things. It might be billing terms. Maybe your company wants to get all the cash upfront so that they can deploy that cash and do things as a business. Whatever the things that matter to your company are, tell the customer that. And so you say, Arman, anytime that somebody is asking for a commercial concession related to the license price, which is what you've asked for, here are the three things that we care about. And then explain like I just did, timing, volume, payment terms. I think we might be able to do something with the license price that you're asking for. I don't know if we can get it exactly to the number that you're asking for. But based on those three things that we really care about, is there one in particular you think we should talk about where you think your side might be able to have some movement on? And now what you've gotten them to do is you've gotten them to take a step forward on the things that they can affect. It is not a good use of your effort to push them hard on timing if that's absolutely not something that they can touch. And so understand where they can affect, and now you can start negotiating on that plane. They want a lower license price. You want upfront billing terms. How should we think about now, Arman, once we've started to align with the customer conceding things or negotiating items? So there needs to be a cost to negotiation. Okay? And so if you just start giving away price constantly, all that's gonna happen is a customer is gonna realize there's no cost to me asking for more. Well, why can't it be a 25% or a 30% or a 35% discount? And so the reason that Nick described you need to create multiple planes in a negotiation is because it's sort of like whack a mole. If they want a lower price, what I'm gonna ask for in return is a longer term. If they're gonna ask for more licenses, right, I might ask for them to include more teams in the deal, whatever it might be. And so what you need to do is not give unilateral concessions. Every time you give something, you need to get something or take something away in return. K? The other thing is you need to start to taper your negotiations. K? And so oftentimes, you'll start with the thing that is most important to them. Right? So let's say, for example, it's price you might start and you say, okay. If pricing is at 50 k right now, you're asking for 25 k. You might say something like, I can get a 4 in front of that. Cool? And they'll say, like, that's gonna be really, really tough. What about the other things? And the key thing is you can start to change and taper what you can give. And you can start to say, like, look. That's all I can do on pricing. But you mentioned y and z were pretty important to you. Right? Maybe we can bundle getting this thing around, like, 40 k in line with getting you net 90 billing terms. Do you think that gets us closer? And so you can make yourself seem tapped out on the asks that ultimately hit your pocket and pivot the negotiation to smaller incremental gives until ultimately the negotiation screeches to a halt. Now there's one last piece that happens here, folks, is sometimes you get into longer negotiations. And what you actually end up having to do is you do the first cut, but then you need to go through one more round of cuts with procurement, for instance. And oftentimes, a great way to get through it in one final cut is via options. Nick, walk us through how you might construct options in a negotiation. Part of the reason that you're constructing options in the first place is it's really tough just to sit there and fight and hold the line. You end up butting heads with the prospect or with procurement. And when you give them options, hey. Here are three different path forwards. You accomplish two things. One, you actually give autonomy to the other person. They no longer feel boxed in. They can pick door a, b, and c, and they're in control. Any of those options, they are in control with. But the beautiful thing about this is because you have constructed those options, you're not allowing them to go through doors d, e, and f. In fact, those doors don't even exist. So one way that you might do this is you might say, okay, Armand. The license price will be a $100 a user if you buy a 100 licenses. But we can get that down to $90 a user if you buy a 130 licenses. And if you really want to get the lowest license price, if you get 200 users, we can get it down to $65 a user. And now what you've done is you've asked them to make a decision around what's most important. Is it the total cost of this thing, or is it going to be the absolute license price? You've given them control, but you're also controlling the options that they have. It's like when you go to a Japanese restaurant, Armand, and you try to order a, a cheeseburger and they say that's not on the menu. You're not upset about that because that wasn't one of the options presented on the menu. You control the menu, the customer feels happy, and you move to getting a deal done. Alrighty, folks. And the last piece here. You've now, at this point, identified a proposal that you think can work for your champion or whoever you're negotiating with, or you've presented options that are palatable and you have a sense of which one they like. K? Do not drop the baby at the finish line. A lot of times people will go back, and what they don't realize is the negotiation wasn't actually done or they didn't make the cut that actually gets the deal done. Or because you went back too quickly, people realize they could ask you for another favor. Right? And so unless they explicitly said this 100% gets it done, I will be signing this contract at the end of the month. There's nothing that will stop it. Power doesn't need to sign off. Finance doesn't need to sign off. Only I need to sign off. What I always recommend doing is get a written commitment from your prospect in return. What that sounds like is I'm gonna say, Nick, it sounds like this would get it done. Right? You mentioned I think we should be good. Can we go and run this option by finance and by your boss, your CMO, before I go to my CEO. And the reason for that is this is a really big ask, and I need to know. My CEO is gonna ask, has their exec team or their finance team signed off on this? And if I can go to them knowing that your team is 100% inked it, I promise you, it will give this a much more likely chance of this deal actually getting done. So can you send me an email at the end of the day once you've gotten the green light internally? And that is how you formally, formally, formally lock up your deal. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, folks. So beginning to end, we talked about finding the leverage in the deal, making sure that it's been budgeted for. You have power's eyes on it. There's a big problem you're solving. You gotta make sure that your timeline is locked up. Otherwise, you're gonna have to use commercial concessions to possibly create timeline. From there, you give pricing and you stop talking. And most of the negotiation is actually discovery. It's acting surprised. It's understanding why they thought they deserved a discount in the first place, and then it's illuminating the gap between you and the competitors. And then from there, you're slowing down and building up how big of an ask it is to get a discount, and then you're asking them to give you the full request from their side and prioritizing what's important to them and then finalizing your deal by not making unilateral concessions and giving them options to create a cost to negotiation that ultimately drag a deal to the finish line. Alright? That's it, Nick. How can people help us out here? Well, if you listen to this episode, chances are you're not going to be throwing as much of your commission check into the trash can. And so you might wanna help your teammates out and say, hey, folks. I'm not throwing my commission check away because I listened to this great negotiation playbook episode. You might wanna give it a listen to. So share this with your team. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes to Presidents Club.
