## Transcript

I'm about to demo a real life scenario where I'm doing executive level discovery, and by the way, is for a product I've never sold before. And I'm gonna be the pissed off prospect. And at each step of Jen's discovery framework, we're gonna pause and break down exactly why she made certain decisions throughout this executive role play. So if you wanna close big deals and you wanna see what an executive conversation actually sounds like, here's what it sounds like. So as a reminder, I am a salesperson selling a security solution. And my dear friend, Armand, over here, he is my prospect who is the director of environmental health and safety at ISU, Illinois State University. You ready to get into this? We keep campuses very secure. Don't be too tough on me. You never know. Okay. Let's get into it. Arman, thanks so much for making the time today. Now, before we get too far in the conversation, I have to ask. I see that for you from Chicago. I've never been, but I've heard the deep dish pizza is amazing. What's your take? I think it's trash. I think deep dish pizza is like if they tried to turn bread bowl soup or bread bowl chili into a pizza, but it was it was like overflowing from the crust and so they had to, like, make the edges really wide. You wait forty five minutes for deep dish pizza. You burn your mouth when you're eating it, and then it just tastes like soggy lasagna. And so I don't like the pizza. So if you come to Chicago, there's lots of great food, but don't get the pizza. Okay. So what pizza place should I eat at instead? Domino's pizza is usually better than Pequod's pizza or Giordano's or whatever it's called. You you none of that nonsense. Okay. I can tell I really struck a nerve. I'm gonna shift off this topic, though I kinda feel like you could spend thirty minutes talking about your hatred. I got a lot of time about it. Okay. We'll take the finger off the the button there. So before we get too far into the discussion about what we do, which I'm sure you're kind of curious in, I wanna take a second just to kinda tee up what I learned about ISU. Now, obviously, I don't work in your shoes, but from what I could tell as an outsider, it looks like there are a ton of different types of buildings on campus that you probably need to protect. So I saw, like, academic halls, residence halls, stadiums, event spaces, and it looks like there's about 21,000 students. And it's a pretty distributed campus. So I'm sure the expectation is probably, like, we gotta keep all these spots safe. But what did I get wrong? Obviously, I don't work there. Yeah. Obviously, they're so we're a very distributed campus, and there are certain spots in campus that are particularly dense. It's weird because you have the center of the campus that's very dense, and so there are a lot a lot of eyes on it. And so it's not as hard to protect the center. But I think one of the things that's challenged about the distributed campus is you have a lot of different hubs, like, kind of on the outside of campus. So you'll have, like, student traffic on the edges and, like, making sure that we keep all of those areas secure as they're very spread out and don't have as many eyes on those, that's a little bit harder for us. So is that, like, one time stuff? Like, we've got events that occur off campus, or are you talking more, like, residence halls are surrounded around the campus? What are you seeing there? It's the latter. So it's more residence halls or, like, an engineering hall or something like that. Alright. So let's do a quick pause. That was step one, which is opening with credibility. Could you break down what you did there? Yes. So we talked about deep dish pizza, and I had no idea Armand had such deep feelings about deep dish pizza. But notice, when you get someone talking about something that they're passionate about, you start to see their personality. So that's exactly what I'm going for there. With that tip I mentioned before, let's say Arman ghosts me later in the sales process. I might use the subject line, pea quads greater than Domino's to trigger him again. That would be something that only he and I have probably talked about from a business perspective, so it's a great way to stand out later on. Great. So that was the rapport piece, and then you moved on to telling me what you know about my business already. So what what did that look like? Yeah. So that's when I got into listen. You've got a large distributed campus. You have 21,000 students. You've got all these different types of buildings. And what I'm looking for there was what did I miss? And Armand did a great job. He adds he added something to it, which was like, yes, but the concentration of our our buildings is primarily here so that's why we have everything here. So notice, that's not something I uncovered in my research. I'm learning something. So even though I wasn't completely correct, it didn't didn't feel like I botched the call because of that. Right? It just felt very, very natural for you to correct me. Correct. For me, it was very easy because I was like, okay. You have this many locations. This is what your campus looks like. And my correction was more an addition Yeah. On the nuance of why security is complex at a distributed campus. So I felt like you already brought me to step 10, and I didn't need to explain, hey. This This is what our campus looks like. This is how many students we have. Yada yada yada. I just explained one nuance, and we were already starting two or three steps ahead. And it it that part took way less time. Right? Like, it wasn't seven minutes of the call, you explaining, well, explaining. Well, we've got this building and that building. So I think we were able to move faster into the call. Exactly. So at this point, you have the lay of the land. You've demonstrated some credibility. And now we move to step two, which is anchor to a strategic objective. Let's do it. When I was doing some research before the call, I was looking at there's this excellence by design initiative that your president talks about a lot. Is that right? Okay. And one of the things he was talking about was just how important it was to increase student retention and graduation rates. Mhmm. Now I don't wanna assume this is the same for you, but a a few of the other universities I'm talking to have spoken about how state government is deinvesting and how that's impacting your cost structure because now you don't have the same revenue that's coming in from the state. So you need to make that up for it with tuition revenue and keeping those students in school matters a lot. But before we go too too far down that path, like, where am I completely off in that? So that is correct for what the university is focused on. In terms of my business, as much as I would love to think that my job in security is to help with retention, honestly, the biggest thing for us is a little bit more, you might have seen that we have some budgetary constraints with funding. And keeping a campus secure with budgetary constraints is honestly the bigger thing on my mind because I feel like it's kind of table stakes to keep your campus safe and, like, that may or may not boost retention. Obviously, an unsafe campus wouldn't be good for retention, but the bigger thing that's on my mind is we are operating with a pretty lean budget due to, like, lack of public funding. And so for that reason, like, I need to be able to keep students safe while not having a really big pocket to spend from. That makes a ton of sense. I would assume you're probably not getting additional headcount to help you with that either. No. If if anything, I'm getting less. Less. Okay. Alright. So let's pause real quick. That was step two, anchoring on a strategic business objective. Could you break down what you did there? Yes. So here's where I'm taking my research on what I uncovered that the university is trying to achieve. So that was the whole excellence by design initiative. That was me saying looks like student retention and enrollment are the focal points. And notice when you corrected me, it helped me get closer to how you interpret the the initiative that you're mindful of. So, again, just because I do research does not mean I'm gonna have a complete answer. That correction allowed me to better understand Arman's point of view on the initiative as opposed to just what I read off of a, you know, chat GBT prompt. Exactly. And so one of the things that we intentionally did here is Jen was saying, hey. A lot of people are focused on employee retention. And I actually kinda wanted to push on that and say, there's another priority that you might have seen somewhere else that is a little bit more what I care about. And if Jen just kept hammering me on some of the original things, I would have felt like she's not listening to me. But then she clearly makes a pivot to understand more about our budgetary constraints. So that finishes step two. Let's go to step three, which is a problem hypothesis. So then when I was looking at it, it looks like when you're looking to protect the campus today, there's a combination of fixed cameras. Right? It seemed like there was a recent investment that was made to kind of establish cameras across the campus. And then it seems like maybe there were it was also, like, an emergency text alert system. So if something goes wrong, like, everyone on campus is alerted. One, did I get that right, or did I get that wrong? And two, what am I missing? Like, what else are you doing to try to keep the the campus secure without investing a lot of extra money in it? Yeah. So we've invested a lot in things that don't literally require a security officer to see the thing for it to go well. And so it's everything from what you described. But also one of the things that we've invested in is we have a campus safety app that all the students are required to download. So it becomes super easy to report an incident or even, like, easily text a line where you can say, hey. I saw this thing at this place. Oftentimes, what is really hard is people will see certain things, but they don't even know how to go about reporting on incidents. And so a lot of this is taking all of the eyes we already have on on campus and making sure that people find it as easy as possible to report an incident if something seems off. Is there an incident that, like, recently occurred when you've had to use that system? There are a shockingly large number of petty theft incidents Interesting. Car break ins in parking lots. Really? Yes. Like, what is like, what's shockingly frequent? Like, how often is that happening in a month? If we get, call it, three to four, DPS, Department of Public Safety Yep. Notifications, I would say at least half of those tend to be related to petty theft, give or take. Oh. It's someone who sneaks into a parking garage and they start looking inside of cars. And oftentimes, students will see these folks, but then they'll just be like, they don't wanna confront the person because that frankly puts them at risk. And so there was one incident where we had caught someone who on camera had been seen multiple times, but we had never, like, gotten there in time. And now a student reported it, and so that was how we were able to catch that incident. So let's pause there again. That was step three, introducing a problem hypothesis. Where did you take the call? So this is a great example of our need to pivot in a conversation. So Armand had mentioned we've got this dense concentration of buildings in the center of the campus. So active listening is really important here. When you hear something earlier in the call, don't stick to a script of where you're gonna go anyway. So what I did, if you notice in the beginning of this part, is I'm seeking to understand. So you've got this dense population of buildings in the center, but how frequently do you have these events where you wouldn't necessarily have a fixed camera because it's a one time event or an infrequent event? So before I go down that path, I'm looking to validate or invalidate my assumption. Notice how it's like it wasn't on script, but if I didn't do it, the original talk track wouldn't have added up. Also notice how all this stuff comes together where Jen was building credibility, understanding the shape of our campus, and then I explained the nuances of the shape of our campus and why it was hard to protect. And then from there, I talked about the issue with budgeting as our strategic objective while still keeping the students safe. And then Jen used that information that she got all the way in step zero or step one around building credibility to say, like, hey. Here's a problem that I think you're gonna have based on what you mentioned earlier in the call, which is you have a very distributed campus. It must be hard to cover all of that with cameras. Exactly. So that was step three, introduce a problem hypothesis. Now we move to step four, which is name the status quo. Okay. So then if this is often happening in parking garages, which makes sense. That's where the money is. How many parking garages do you have on campus? I couldn't find that in advance. We divide the the campus into quadrants. Yeah. So, usually, each quadrant has two to three major parking lots, and those are surrounding the major entry points of the school. So you've got somewhere between eight to 10 parking lots including some of the off campus smaller lots. And then how many fixed cameras in each? Because I imagine, like, you've also got the stadiums, you've got the residence halls, like, you've got a lot of places and there was a finite amount of budget that you were spending on fixed cameras. So how many are in the parking garages? Do you know offhand? Yeah. So it depends on the the arrangement or the size of the parking garage. But, usually, you wanna have one in each major corridor Okay. Within the parking garage. So if you think of, like, how a floor is laid out, you usually have, like, one on each corner, so there's four. But then also you have all the in between halls, so there's, like, another two. And then you also have all the stairwell, so there's another two. So if you have a five story parking garage, you might have anywhere between 20 to 40 cameras set up in a parking garage, give us a sec. Okay. And so are there still spots within that pocket parking garage though that would be not visible by camera? There are definitely going to be spots where something can't be seen. Okay. You can never get everything. Yeah. I mean, even if you walk around like an apartment complex, you'll see that the cameras are usually at the major choke points Yeah. Where you kind of, like, have to pass through it. So we have all the major pathways covered, like, all of the the nodes in the pathways per se, But there are definitely things that could be missed due to gaps in the camera. Okay. So it sounds like the parking garages are kinda covered. One of the things I saw when I was doing some research before was that there was an event that happened at a student it looked like a student pep rally or something. And when I was re I could be totally off here, but I was reading the article and it looked like you couldn't identify who was actually, like, conducting the crime. Yeah. So I'm wondering, parking garages make sense. Right? Because it's a fixed building. You always have the same traffic in and out. What about, like, when you have a pep rally or you have an event on campus where you don't typically have as much crime? How many like, do you think cameras are covering those areas well? Or Yeah. So for those ones, that's where it's really hard because, I mean, you've probably seen on NBC News where it's like person breaks into the store and you see the fidelity of those camera images. Yeah. And it's like, even in a store where it's a fixed location, it's kinda hard to make out what's going on. Mhmm. When you have 400, 500 students or if there's a major period where classes end and people are trafficking all around Yeah. It's so easy for someone to, like, disappear on camera, which is, again, it's part of the reason that we're trying to rely on, like, students to report things because they can use their eyes to identify people a little bit more as opposed to me looking at, like, a pixelated camera image where the person disappears. And then I've gotta look at, like, 17 different frames to, like Mhmm. Figure out what that person looks like where they went. Alright. So let's pause right there. That was step four, name the status quo. Could you break down what you did? Yeah. So, again, I'm going back to my research. And what I found in my research, if you remember, is that they had just invested in fixed cameras and they have this, text system where they alert the campus if an event is occurring. Now what's interesting and the reason why we always seek to be corrected, not correct, is because Arman brought up a point around security guards and how not likely it is to be able to make the case to invest in more security guards because they aren't allowed to have additional headcount. So that's yet again something else I learn in discovery simply by asking for a correction. Alright. So now let's move on to step five, which is empathize with the status quo. It's so hard. I I hear this a lot when I'm talking to others at other universities. It's like the expectation is we completely eliminate crime. And so we're also doing that within a fixed fee environment where we don't have a ton of headcount. We can't put security guards at every spot because we just don't have the funding to do that. Like, that's a really tough spot to be in. Yeah. It's one of those things where it's, unfortunately, no one gets thanked Yeah. For like, hey, no one broke into cars. Yeah. It's just kind of expected. Yeah. But the problem is, I mean, you see it all the times where it's so hard to find a bad actor Mhmm. In a place and it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. So you try to cover as many areas as you can with cameras. But the reality is someone who's a little bit more adept in crime, they're gonna be able to spot the holes in the system and they're gonna try to find your blind spots. And you can't literally surveil an entire campus nor do I think that is what our students would want. Right. Big brother watching. That's tough. Right? Because there's only so many cameras you can place because there's a fixed budget for that, it sounds like. Can't hire a ton more security guards because that's another headcount expense. And then even with the emergency alert system, that's happening after an event recurs. Right? It's not preventing crime. Right? Exactly. Yeah. It's tough. I think one of the things we see is particularly for campuses that are in a city like yours is, there's already a little bit of hesitation from students who are either considering enrollment or already enrolled around what does safety look like. Like, I'm going away from my home for the first time. I'm not with my family. What happens if something negative happens to me? We actually have seen that it impacts retention rates and and enrollment rates. Are you seeing something different? If there is a place that feels, from a reputation standpoint, unsafe. For example, I have friends who have gone to USC. Mhmm. And USC is, like, in an area where it's, like, pretty rugged urban environment and there's a lot of crime around the area. You will see students who hesitate to go to school unless they are living on campus. But the reality is usually sophomore, junior year, you start to move off campus. I would say for us, having issues around retention specifically related to student safety is less the issue. It's hard to know if you're having issues with student retention due to that, but it comes up in, like, NPS surveys or in, like, student wellness surveys where you'll ask the students about a variety of different things, affordability of housing, all this stuff. And some of the rising of these break ins and others incidents has led students to be concerned around overall student safety Mhmm. In the overall, like, sentiment of the population. So, like, your goal is to drive positive academic outcomes and a great experience for the students. And so it's definitely impacting Mhmm. The experience. Whether that is the reason that people are dropping out or transferring colleges is probably another question. I don't know if that would be the only Mhmm. Reason, but I see it as a contributor to student happiness and well-being. Do those NPS scores get reported publicly? They do. Okay. As a public university, we need to report those. Alright. Let's pause. That was step five, empathize with the status quo. Now notice I'm not saying, Arman, you're not doing your job correctly because you don't have every inch of this campus covered because that's unrealistic. And so what I'm doing here is I'm if you notice the tonality of of how I responded, I'm showing empathy. Empathy the fact that, like, this is a really tough job. There's serious consequences if something goes wrong. This is a human being on the other side of the phone with actual repercussions that happen to them if if a negative event occurs. So that's why we talked about it's really important to empathize with the situation that they're in. It's a it's a really difficult job to be up against. What I felt as a prospect is Jen was saying, hey, your job must be really hard. And in my mind, in character, I was like, yeah. It's really hard to protect the whole campus, and it's even harder to do that when you don't have money. And on top of that, it's kind of a thankless job because, like, how could you possibly cover every single inch of a campus? There's no way you could. And no one is, like, stoked when you do a good job. They're only pissed when you do a bad job. Yeah. So that was step five, empathize with the status quo. Let's move on to step six, which is introduce an enemy to the status quo. Because I'm wondering. Right? If I'm making the trade off between, do I go to ISU or do I go to, I don't know, the other ISU Indiana State? They're relatively close, relatively similar in size. Like, I see that one campus is safer than the other and my parents are heavily involved in that decision, I wonder if they might push me towards the safer campus. Possibly. I think if there's a stark enough difference Yeah. One could, I my mom likes to worry. And so Well, mom got that. I could see mom mom whether or not mom would be able to convince me to go to a, you know, that lesser university down the block as TBD. But, yeah, it could it could factor in. Okay. Because I was talking to Penn State University, which is my alma mater. And one of the things they were saying is, like, it is really tough with to manage this trade off because, obviously, the job is to prevent crime. Right? It's not simply to react to crime. But when you have a fixed budget, you can't dump a ton of money into putting cameras everywhere. So one of the things that they were looking at is is there a way to not fix the cameras but have it so you can move those cameras around? So let's say, like, you have a pep rally, and you know you're gonna have a large population of students that walk into that gym. But, normally, it's a low traffic area. You can't really justify a camera. Is there a way that you could actually put something there that would allow them you to feel like we've got eyes on those students Yeah. Without having a fixed camera in a place where you're just not gonna typically have high traffic? So that was something they were exploring, which is how do we think differently about the monitoring of student safety as opposed to the reacting of student safety. Yeah. That almost essentially allows you to have, like, more campus patrol Yeah. Around without having more campus patrol around, especially with the overnight shifts. I mean, imagine you see during the day how many people are walking around campus. Imagine having the same number of security people and staff all through the night. It's it's frankly impossible, so you just have to pick and choose. So that's I didn't I didn't know that was possible. It's it's interesting. Like, the even if you look at attrition for manned security guards, it's such a high attrition job. So you're having to constantly throw money into recruiting and investing. And that's I mean, based on what you described about the cost situation, that's a a unnecessary cost. So I know we're coming up on time here. Alright. Pause right there. That was step six, introduce an enemy to the status quo. Let's break it down. So here, notice what I did is I brought in the example from Penn State. So, again, I'm not finger pointing and saying, well, what you should do is this. I'm I'm creating this moment where I'm saying this other university was doing something similar. Here's the thing that they didn't realize was going on. And so as we talked about before, it makes it safer for Armand and executive to be able to be like, yeah. Okay. I kinda fall into that trap too without assigning blame towards him for not doing his job effectively. This is also one place where I can start to get a sense of the solution that Jen is offering, but it's not in the way of, like, hey. I think you should use this thing, like, buy my product. It's like, hey. Like, someone else also dealt with the same problem. Here's how they solved it. And how they solved it probably happens to be what Jen is trying to sell. But I look at Penn State as a respected peer, and it's easier for me to be more open to that when I hear how a respected peer solved the problem versus how a salesperson wants me to solve the problem. And that's a great example of, like, sometimes you're gonna be pushed a little bit to to tease the solution. I noticed I didn't get into pitching mode. I positioned it more as an idea. Like, here's an idea another university is tackling, which is we don't have to have a fixed, you know, fixed camera in place. There's a different way to think about camera monitoring. But I'm not then going into a deep pitch about it because at this place, I'm still just testing the waters. And so if you noticed his reaction was a bit like, didn't know that was an option, that's an ideal state, I think, to be looking at at this point in discovery, which is just opening up the executive's eyes to new ways of thinking about solving existing problems. Alright. So we've empathized with the status quo, and now it's time to move to the high impact close. Let me just pause for a second. I've really been enjoying the conversation. I hope you have too. Based on what we've covered so far, I'm gonna ask you two questions, actually. One is, does this feel like, this issue of protecting students, reducing or ideally eliminating crime on campus, does that feel like a problem worth exploring? Yeah. I I would say so. It's within within cost. Yeah. That that that's the job. And, with some of the recent spikes, it I would I would like to continue exploring it. Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is worth exploring with the caveat of can't be a 8 figure solution to address it because that's not realistic. Okay. So I'm gonna ask you a second question. It's gonna sound a lot like the first, but I want you to be completely transparent in your answer with me. Is does this feel like a problem worth exploring right now? So right now, we are sitting in it's coming toward the end of the school year. And so right now, we're in March. Mhmm. And so anything that we would be discussing would be for the new school year deployment. And so my guess is we're not gonna keep the campus safer from April to June other than the things that we already have planned. We start to do a lot of our planning around security and budgeting once the school year ends. And so it's, like, a little bit early. Mhmm. But that planning cycle begins in, call it, June, July, give and take. So and this is probably not the only thing you're planning for come June, July. Right? I imagine there's a ton of others. Okay. So here's what I'm thinking. Why don't we schedule time for Friday? And what we'll do in Friday is I'll walk you through how Penn State shifted from what they used to do to increase security to what they do now. If you like what you're hearing and you're interested to explore more, then we can shift and talk about exactly what the solution is and how much it costs and all the things I'm sure you're wondering. But first and foremost, why don't we use our time that way, and then you can decide if this is even something worth going down the path of. And if it's not, by the way, you can shoot me straight and you can tell me to cut bait. That's all good. I know there's a ton of stuff that you have to plan for come planning season. But maybe that way you can evaluate even if this is something worth looking into. Cool. Sure. Well, that was easy. There you go. Alright. And that is a wrap. So that was step seven, a high impact close. What did you make of the way that I responded and how we closed the interaction? So I think it's, like, a really good example of a very practical response. Right? It's not like your executive is gonna be like, I am drowning and I need I need help. Throw me a a life jacket. What he said, if you notice, was, like, yes. It's a problem worth exploring, but that's very common. It's, like, I will open the door a little bit, which is our goal, but I'm not gonna, like, spend just because you gave a great discovery conversation. So what I did there is I acknowledge what I'm hearing because I want to build that trust. So I'm hearing this is a problem worth looking into, but I'm also hearing it can't be an 8 figure solution to solve that problem. It's really important at this point to make the executive feel heard and not just take it as our ticket to start pitching. By separating those two questions, I also think I got a better answer around predictability of this deal and timing of the deal. So notice when he talked about, like, we're not gonna change things between April and June, that gave me a clear signal of how can I position the need to have a conversation between now and June but not put this thing in my forecast for July? Because that's really unlikely we'd get through problem, solution, and budget all in that time line. So I get really clear clarity, and it also, at the end, would allow me to make a recommendation for next steps that felt aligned with your schedule as opposed to align with my end of quarter. This allowed me to opt in to the next step because a lot of times, a seller will get to the end of a discovery call and they'll be like, great. The next step is let's schedule a demo. And sometimes the prospect will be like, okay. And then they'll cancel later. Or sometimes they'll be like, I'm I'm good or whatever because you haven't actually given your prospect the chance to explicitly say, hey. Was this relevant? Do you want to opt in for more? And so one, you did that, but then two, you also removed the pressure of the sale by saying, and if you don't like what you see, you can totally tell me to kick rocks or whatever it is. I didn't feel under pressure. I felt like under my own control, I was choosing to take a next step knowing that you weren't going to try to force me to buy something. I think that's such an important call. It's a mistake I made all the time. The second you start introducing demos and things like that, someone feels like now I'm entering your sales process. And I think there's this moment where an executive thinks, do I really wanna do this? Because once I know I'm in your forecast, I know you're never gonna let me out. And do I wanna sign up and opt in to that? And so notice, like, the step we talked about is talking about how another university solved this problem. That's insight. That's ideas, things that we can offer them. And then that way, it's not here's the demo of the product. It's more here's what another person in your position did, which as we talked about before is is generally what executives are curious about. What are you doing that I'm not? What do you know that I don't? And so it's very much in line with an executive audience and the type of thing they wanna hear about. The demo itself, candidly, might fall to someone on his team. And I don't necessarily wanna give up the sale at the executive level that quickly because it'll be much easier for me to take that next step for the demo with the team once I have the executive saying, we need to solve this problem. We need to solve it now. So part of this is also just about, like, not losing control of the conversation by getting too quick into product. So if you wanna learn how to prepare for and deliver discovery conversations like this with executives, check out the link in the show notes below for our course on selling to the c suite. You'll learn how to do discovery. You'll also learn how to earn and book meetings with executives. You'll learn how to manage champions, and you'll learn how to multithread, particularly in bigger deals where you've got lots of different stakeholders involved. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes.
