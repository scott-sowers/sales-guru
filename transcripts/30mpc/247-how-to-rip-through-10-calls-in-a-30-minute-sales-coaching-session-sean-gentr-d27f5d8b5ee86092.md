## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my cohost, Mark Casaglow. And today, we have Sean Gentry. He is an outstanding sales leader over at Webflow, one of the best episodes we've ever had on hands on coaching with reps. Mark, why should people listen? I've worked with Sean before. Sean is the kind of manager that you send good performers to to be great, and you send okay performers to to be good. And I think in this episode, you'll see exactly why he's that kind of a up level your rep type of leader. He has a defined way of doing things, and he has done it enough that he can explain it because he actually does it. He's a operator. He's doing this stuff. He's not just a talking head about it. Boom. And a three, two, one. Let's roll. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, Sean. Welcome to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. So number one is gonna be working backwards to diagnose issues. So so often new managers fall into the, quote, unquote, do more trap. Right? They're telling the reps to make more calls, sell more deals, close those deals faster. But reps and managers really need to learn what's causing that behavior and the actions behind it. So I would start with the result that you want to influence. Let's say that's closing percentage, and then work backwards through a checklist to find the root of the issue and make small tweaks to influence that outcome. So for example, if you find out that one of your reps really is struggling with conversion rate, right, they need to increase that. It's not gonna happen overnight. So you have to find the things that are influencing that. And let's say you pinpoint that it's setting next steps. That's the point there that you have to work on simply setting next steps and see that improve week over week to eventually influence closing percentage. Alright. The next step is number two. Yeah. So once you find that issue so let's say it's setting next step. We'll stay on that. Issue number two is really creating a repeatable coaching process. So people crave process. They wanna know the guide rails of their job. And once you find a specific issue to coach on, you're gonna create a repeatable framework with that rep. So this includes finding that issue. Let's say it's setting next steps. You wanna align on it with your rep and make sure you're both bought into that being the key thing to change. You obviously have to document it in a shared doc so that you know that's the thing you're focused on, and then plan that action together. So you say, hey. You've got a call coming up in two days. Let's book the last ten minutes of that to set next steps. Let's role play through it a couple times. And then the key here is to automate the follow-up. So as a manager, I would go through and delay a Slack message or delay an email to hit their inbox five minutes after that call completes to follow-up on whether they said next steps or not. Alrighty, Sean. What's number three? So number three is eliminating the micromanage. Right? I don't think I've ever met a rep or a manager who says they love to be micromanaged. It's usually the exact opposite. So how you get away with this is that you proactively communicate everything that you're doing. So every single Friday, I create a framework document that my reps send to me to keep me informed of what's happening with their business. So this includes their revenue, how they're pacing, what they have in their pipeline, what's going well in their business, what's maybe not going well in their business, what they're focused on for the following week. And the bonus hack here is that once I've compiled all that, I actually send the exact same framework document out to my leader so they stay in tune with what I'm working on week over week. Well, we have another great sales leader who's if you boil down the theme, it comes down to coaching. And coaching, I think, is, like, one of these great unlocks. So, Sean, let's dig into coaching a little bit more. If you're looking at a rep or looking at a team or, you know, I know you've had teams underneath you too. How do you identify what to coach on? Do you have, like, a series of, hey. Here's the punch list. Make sure you look into this. Are you self diagnosing for each individual rep? Like, the what to coach on question is a seminal question that most sales leaders don't take time to answer. So how do you know what to coach on? Normally, when you're looking at your rep that's struggling, right, not hitting quota, it's gonna come down to, I think, one of three major factors. One is simply gonna be conversion rate. They're just not closing enough deals that they have in their pipeline. The second thing is gonna be ACV or contract value. Sometimes, let's say, they are closing the right amount, but they're just lower end deals, and they're not able to hit to their quota. And then the third thing falls under sales cycle. Right? So they close enough deals. Maybe they're a little bit smaller, but they're just not simply closing enough, out of their pipeline and quickly enough to fall within that quota period. So once you land on an end result, most managers stop there and they say, hey. You know, Bob or Shirley, you have to increase your close rate. But they don't know what's actually influencing that. And so what's really been helpful for me is I have built out a checklist of all the things that go into, let's say, a closing percentage. And this starts with really separating a day to day of a rep into two major areas. One is gonna be everything they say on the phone with their customer or prospect. The second is gonna be everything that they do off the phone. Right? So that's sending follow-up emails, organizing their pipeline, keeping their pipeline up to date, multithreading through their business or the org. And so once you separate it to, hey. Are they saying the right things on the phone to the right people, or are they struggling with things that they're doing off the phone? You then can work back through another checklist to find that small issue. Right? So let's say, Mark, you know, it comes down to conversion rate, and we found out that Tom on my team is just simply not setting next steps. He's talking to the right people, talking to the right companies. He knows their why. But by the time we get to next steps, he's letting the ball, you know, land in their court every single time, which leads to ghosting or, you know, him chasing deals, and therefore his conversion rate is suffering. So we can make those tiny tweaks, set actionable coaching to just that one small instance. Hey, Tom. The last ten minutes of the call, you gotta set next steps. And that's the big thing for you to focus on right now, and you make those small changes that are gonna lead to the end result. Yeah. Telling people to do stuff and getting them to do it is two totally different things. So you tell Tom, hey. You're gonna go do this. How you making sure that he actually does it? Because you have eight, ten other reps. If you have multiple teams, twenty, thirty other reps, like, you can't keep your thumb on Tom all day. Yeah. So I I view coaching the same way I view selling. Right? So when I was a rep, you're not gonna sell your products until your persona or your point of contact wants it. They have to be bought in. They have to wanna go on the journey with you to get that thing sold. They gotta sell it internally. And I view coaching the exact same way. When you're working with a rep, if they're not bought in, if they don't want to see the change, they're gonna resist you. They're gonna dig their heels in the sand. So I think as a manager, once you're able to pinpoint, hey. I've I've listened to enough Gong calls. I've seen that Tom is not setting next steps on these. It's finding what that issue is, but then the first way I would approach it is asking Tom. I'd say, hey, Tom. Like, we know that conversion rate is below the average right now. We know that's the main area we're struggling with. Why do you think that is? Because I'm curious to hear their opinion. Sometimes as a manager, I get surprised. They may say, oh, I'm struggling with x, y, and z, and it's something that I hadn't pinpointed. But if we're not able to come to that conclusion, that's where I bring it up and say, hey. I've listened to the last four or five Gong calls. It seems like we're struggling with next steps. Would you agree that's an issue? And I need them to buy into, hey. This is the thing we're gonna try to solve together just like a sales cycle. And then once we're aligned, it's documentation and follow-up. But to your point, like, if you can't align with your reps on what they need to be coached on, you're gonna be shouting into a void as a sales leader. You're gonna be telling them the same thing every time. They're not gonna be doing it. So you gotta make sure that they're bought in and willing to go on the journey with you. I think one thing that makes a really outstanding coach, Sean, is your ability to diagnose. And your ability to diagnose is oftentimes limited by how many calls you can listen to, how many calls you can be on. And this is something that I struggled with a lot when I was coaching SMB sales is I could not possibly be on every call. I can't watch a million SMB calls. But at the same time, I feel like so much of the nuance is lost if I'm looking at sales stage conversion rates, for example. And so when you wanna figure out what's going on with a rep, there's the sales stage conversion method. There's the listen to 3,000 Gong calls method. There's the pipeline review, deal review method. What do you find is the most fruitful source of coaching intel, or is it sort of a combination of all the above? So I think it varies shot by shot. I think one of the biggest hacks that's helped me get really strong in my coaching is been the time that I spend with myself. So I think what what's interesting is that if I look at my calendar right now and I pull it up for every single week, I've got thirty minutes per rep blocked as one on one prep on my calendar. Where if I'm working with tone, what most managers are gonna do is they're gonna jump one on one to one on one to one on one to customer call to internal meeting, and they're never gonna have time to actually prep for themselves on how they want that one on one to go. So what I've done that I feel like has made me successful with this is that before my one on ones, I've got time blocked where I can dig into those reports. Right? I can listen to Gong calls. I can go through their sales stages and where the maybe deals are falling in. So that I'm able to basically come to my own conclusions about where that rep is struggling week over week so that when I'm meeting with them and I'm aligned, I'm not going in blind to what they may think. Right? So I think the prep is a huge thing that people overlook in sales management that I have to be prepared to understand what to coach on, make sure it's the right thing. And then I think to your point, when it comes to every single company, they're gonna have different reports and different things in outreach or, you know, SalesLoft or Gong that'll help you come to your conclusions. But I like to start with those big three, right, on sales conversion, contract value, sales cycle, find if they're below the mean or below the average outstamingly from the rest of the team, and then kinda work my way backwards through my own checklist. I'm hearing, like, we got an issue, work backwards, find the root cause, get alignment on that issue with the rep, get agreement that they need help, then you do that in a repeatable process. You know, you're prepping. They're coming to their one zero one. It's the same. They can expect it. And then you're then transitioning to, now let's go from this being driven by me to let's this be driven by you, mister or miss rep. Do you have, like, a story, Sean, or, like, an illustration of somebody that got it and how it happened? Because, like, that's the ultimate is when your rep says to you, hey. I'm prepping a half hour before our one zero one because I wanna tell you about the stuff that I need help with because I know you can help me. I don't always need you to tell me what I need help with. So take me through, like, a rep or two that you've done that with or, like, how the process works. Yeah. Well, I think the the beauty of the framework in general is that once a rep goes through it a couple times, to your point, they know what to expect. Right? Like, Mark, I've heard you talk about forecasting calls a ton, and we we hear this from working together, where people come in and they've got everything dialed up. They know what questions you're gonna ask, and they could come prepared. So once you get reps to go through this a couple times, let's say Tom knocks it out of the park and start setting next steps for the next five calls. Right? It's not something you need to continue to harp on. But with most reps, they're going to have a myriad of issues of things that they could always get better on, and then you go to the next one. But for this specific story, I had a rep that had a high conversion rate higher than the rest of the team, was doing great in sales cycle. But the biggest thing is that a lot of his deals were much smaller than the average. Right? So our average contract value was around 60 to 70 k ARR, and most of his deals were almost half that. So digging in and listening to some of the calls, you know that's going to be an on call issue as a manager. And then when you start listening to the last ten or fifteen minutes, one thing I would say as a manager too is you don't have to listen to the entire thirty or sixty minute Gong call. If you know that issue is contract value, just listen to the section on Gong that's highlighted for pricing. Right? You know that's gonna be the issue. Normally, that's three to five minutes. You can bust out 10 calls in an hour. And so once you listen to that section, we found out that this rep was discounting well before any negotiations were taking place. Right? Didn't necessarily feel confident about the pricing that we had and would say, hey. You know what? Our normal contract values range between 60 to 70,000. But from where you're at, it sounds like you're probably gonna need a solution that's around the 30 k range. Right? And not sticking to the value of the product, automatically dropping down and discounting. And because of that, he had a great conversion rate with selling deals a little bit faster, but he needed double the amount of deals to get to quota. And so because we've gone through this coaching framework a couple times, we would show up to the beginning of the month and say, alright. You know what do you need to work on? And they're saying, yes. This is the thing I'm working on. This is my contract value stinks. It's half that of the team. What do we need to do? He's bought in. He knows the problem, and then we're able to go through and pinpoint exactly what's influencing that. You're just negotiating yourself out of a deal. You're negotiating yourself out of a contract value, and here's what we need to work on. Let's role play through this. You've got this call on Tuesday. What's your approach? What's your goal? Let's role play. And then I'm delaying that Slack message for five minutes because, Arman, like your point, I can't be on every single call. The Slack message automatically comes through and says, hey. How did the last ten minutes of the pricing call go? What did you find out? Right? And then I don't have to remember to exactly do that, but it automatically hits their Slack or their inbox at that time. Dude, this is so smart. And I think one mistake that a lot of managers, leaders make is they're like, we're gonna do call reviews, and they spend an hour reviewing a thirty minute call because you're listening to it on one x speed. You're listening to the whole thing. You're pausing for feedback at each moment. And one of the things that probably helped me similarly the most was being able to slice up a tape review like a turkey as quick as humanly possible. So, for example, the other day, I was coaching a founder, and we only had seven minutes left in our advisory call. And I was like, hey. I don't know if we're gonna have time to go through it, but let's see if we can get to the problem quickly. And I knew he was struggling with discovery. So I skimmed the images of the call, and I figured out when he was going to show a demo. And that's when I knew I was gonna stop. And it was at the twelve minute mark. So I knew at most it was gonna be twelve minutes of discovery, and then I skipped past all of the rapport upfront, and there was five minutes of rapport. So that leaves really, like, six to seven minutes left of the part of the call that I know he's gonna struggle with because we've already agreed upon that he needs to work on discovery on previous calls. And so I can rip through a thirty minute tape, a forty minute tape in six minutes or three minutes when it's on two x speed. And you can do 10 of those in a thirty minute one on one. So I love what you're doing there, Sean. Same exact thing for managers and role plays. Right? If you know its next steps, you do not need to go through a thirty minute role play that includes the disco and the discovery and all, you know, and the demo. It's like, just do the next steps. Role play those five minutes six times. Right? And then in that thirty minute session, how much better are they going to get doing it out of six times versus just one time in a thirty minute call? Sean, are you using AI in coaching yet, and it's okay to say no? I'm not, but the way that you ask me means that I probably should be. Here it is. It's that time of the interview. It's AI. We know the issue is is even though you're giving a lot of really good guidance on how to find time to coach by cutting out unnecessary things that you're doing that don't help with the specific issue that you're trying to train or coach or help with. A lot of people, Sean, aren't gonna sit down and prep for half an hour for a one on one. They're gonna answer emails. Even if it's on their block, they're gonna answer emails and get and get on Slack. They're not gonna come in with a plan. They're gonna come in and be like, well, show me a call, call, or they're gonna expect their reps to self diagnose when most reps aren't good with that and don't have the same data that the leader does. So I'm seeing, like, a couple of things that are happening with AI that I think are really disruptive for coaching. And if you're a rep and you can get good coaching on a daily basis, you have a chance to really quickly improve versus on a weekly basis with a manager. I think that's why one of the things that you're talking about is so important, Sean, which is getting people to do it on their own and creating that culture. So it's more than just a process. It's a culture. And I know you were really instrumental with that culture at Outreach. So talk a little bit about, like, beyond the tactics and the tips. What do you hire for? Like, how do you get people addicted to this getting better? Like, you know, man, we'd show up at 6AM in the Outreach office. There'd be twenty, twenty five reps in there, and all we do is, like, help each other iron sharpen iron for a couple hours before the day got started. That wasn't totally organic, but it wasn't totally architected. Like, how are you being more intentional about creating that culture? A lot of it does go into hiring. Right? The one of the things that we always look for, and I think a man a lot of managers can say this is extreme coachability. I think there's no surprise that some of the greatest reps out there were former either athletes or even people that had played an instrument for a long time. People that have spent hours and hours and hours honing their craft, getting specific small feedback to make themselves better is usually a great precursor to somebody that's gonna come in and do well in sales. So I think that's somebody you absolutely hire for. And then to your point, Mark, people want to be challenged in this role without being forced. And I think where that challenge comes from is a manager believing that they're better than they are today. So, like, I have been fortunate enough whether it was working for you or Kevin Dorsey or other people in my past. Like, they've always believed that I was I was and can be better than I am today, which has inherently motivated me to achieve that. And, like, hey, I'm not gonna let you down, Mark. Like, I will be better tomorrow than I am today. And part of that challenge comes with that feedback. Right? So I think where I've seen, you know, other orgs or other reps that I've worked with have given me some feedback to say like, hey, my last job, my manager just kinda let me do my own thing, was out on an island. And I think, inevitably, reps want to be pushed, but they also wanna be believed in. Right? And being told that, like, hey. I know you can do this. You're better than you are today, and let's keep coaching you there. So I think part of it is building that individual culture from a frontline manager standpoint, believing in reps, coaching them that they can be better, giving them specific feedback, and challenging them. People with that background, with the extreme coachability that you've hired for will become addicted to that. I know I have been. Whether I was being a rep, being a manager, being a director. Like, I wanna know what my opportunities are to get better, and I know the people that have believed in me and coached me along the way has challenged me and, like, kept me addicted to that. So there's a magic question of how do you test for coachability in your interview process early on? Yeah. There's always a a great question that most managers will ask, like, how coachable are you? Right? Or give me a piece of feedback that you've that you've gotten in the last, last role, and how have you applied it. And I think all of that is well and good. I think if you do ask that question, like, hey. Tell me about your last manager. How did they give you feedback? How do you like to receive feedback? And then tell me how you implemented that. The reps that I've found during the interview process that have given very specific examples, like, hey. Mark told me that I was struggling with my conversion rate. We boiled that down to setting next steps, and this is how he worked on setting next steps with me. That's gonna tell me a lot more than, you know, yeah. They gave me feedback every now and then and kind of giving this ambiguous vague answer. So that's the first thing. But as part of our interview process, even here at Webflow, we do a role play round. They have to role play part of the discovery. We ask their feedback. We give them feedback. And what I'm really looking for, and this may be a hack for people that are are gonna listen to this, is do they ask to do it again? Right? So I'm more in tuned with the people that take the feedback and say, hey. Thanks so much for that feedback. Can I try it again? Right? Because a role play is never that fun. It's never that easy. But I want the people that are going to get feedback on how to do it and then want to do it again. That for me is a big precursor to somebody that's gonna come into the role and say, like, hey. I I got knocked off the horse, but I wanna get back on. Right? So that's a big thing that we're looking for. So what's what's interesting is when I think about some of the top reps that I hired at Pave, we would always have the mock discovery call as a test. And a lot of times, a mock discovery call can be a false positive or a false negative. Sometimes the environment is really uncomfortable. If you're having them sell your product, they might not understand it or they might not be they might take a little bit longer to learn, but once they're ramped, they're gonna be 10 out of 10. There are so many things that could be false positives or false negatives. They could be really good at mocks, for example. I know there are reps who are really good in the practice room, and then they freeze in front of a deal. But one thing's for sure. Anytime a rep was, like, a yellow light, not a green light, but we're like, there's something here, like, everything else seemed really good, we would run back the mock discovery again. We would give them a week to prepare, get ready for it. And anytime a rep aced it the second time, I have never had that rep not be a top rep every single time. So much so that we almost always consider doing two mock discos. We didn't wanna do that because it would lengthen the interview process, but you're totally right on that. You can engineer coaching or even take a piece of them off and have them redo it again as part of your interview process. And the second pass around is the best way to see if someone is actually coachable. 100%. And to your point about delaying the hiring process, like, I would rather always, always, always take that extra week or two and hire slow and make sure that they're the right people. Because nothing makes your life easier as a sales manager than having great people on your team. If you hire great people who want to be coached and wanna get better and wanna be challenged and hit their numbers, nothing makes your life easier. So I'd much rather take the extra week, confirm it that way, and then, yeah, set yourself up for success. Can we go back to the topic of self diagnosing? Because both you and Mark have hit on this that reps aren't great at it. And, Sean, earlier on in the prep, you were talking about how you can motivate people to do things themselves, coach themselves, etcetera. And I think as a rep, I didn't have a great first manager, so I had to learn about what to look for to coach myself. But even for me, a pretty metrics driven guy, I would find that I wouldn't know what I was doing wrong unless someone else was looking at me. So how do you coach your reps to coach themselves, or do you think that's a complete waste of time and that's your job entirely? Yeah. So it's a great question. I think with that, reps have to know what's coming first and foremost. Right? So I think to teach anybody to coach themselves, they have to be taught how to look internally and self diagnose. Right? So doing this enough times, they're going to learn what that framework and what that process looks like. I I think back, you know, Nick Saban just retired, but one of the best coaches out there, and he talks a lot about wide receivers running routes. So he knows the end goal is that you have to get open. Right? You got a 15 yard slant route. You gotta get open. But the way that he's coaching is doing the minuscule things along that route to help yourself get open. Right? So you have to make this cut in two yards, and you gotta dig your right foot in the ground here at this point. And then at the, you know, 10 yards, you gotta cut hard left. And so he's coaching the reps to focus on the small things. And when he's running those wide receivers through enough iterations of that, they start to pick it up of like, oh, yeah. These are the things that are going to influence the outcome of me being open and me being able to catch this ball. And I think about that the same way in coaching a rep is that the first time you're finding out, like, hey. They need to be setting next steps. They're probably not gonna know how you worked backwards to get to that issue. But as you start working with them month over month, quarter over quarter, eventually, they should start to pick up. Hey. These are the tiny things that I'm doing that influence the outcomes. Right? So maybe it even comes down to is minuscule the thing of, like, hey. I'm sending out the right sequences, but I'm sending them out to the wrong people, and that's why my meetings are low. And that is a minuscule thing that is the exact, like, company size or the wrong persona that I'm sending these sequences to. And so once you go through this framework enough and they know what to look for, the goal is that they show up to these meetings and they say, hey. I'm struggling with sales cycle, and it's all because it's taking me way too long to set up an initial meeting or see that meeting through, and they can kinda learn how to self diagnose themselves. And back to our coaching part before, if they are intrinsically motivated and getting challenged and wanting to be better, they should hopefully buy into this aspect that the they're going to be working on small things as their time as a rep to get them to that end stage of them being successful. Awesome. Well, Sean, we talked about a ton of good habits that leaders can practice. I love some of the stuff you had around coaching, and now we have to talk about a bad habit. And I think I know what you're gonna say. But what is one bad habit that every sales leader in the world should break, throw in the trash today to make the world a better place? Yes. Please stop trying to motivate your sales reps through fear and money. These are extrinsic motivators. When you motivate somebody by saying, hey, you're going to make x amount of dollars or you're going to lose your job. That is going to cause burnout. It's gonna cause frustration. It's gonna cause disconnect in the relationship. What you should focus on is the intrinsic motivator. So people wanting to get better, wanting to serve their prospects or their company, wanting to make a valued impact in what they're doing. That's going to motivate somebody to want to be coached, to continue to show up as opposed to just, hey. I'm doing my job so that I don't get fired. Yeah. Stop motivating people through fear and money. Boom. Well, I was gonna try to scare people into listening to the recap afterwards, but I'm not gonna do that today, folks. Sean, this was an outstanding interview. To praise y'all with Honey, if you wanna hear the Mark and Mondo recap afterwards, we're gonna recap all the amazing things that came up from this interview. Cheers, folks. Today's show was brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alrighty, Mark. What'd you think? Listen. My man Sean brought it. I mean, I think that there's some real tactical stuff in there, but I think the thing I take away from it that challenges me is, am I putting time on my calendar to actually prep and have meetings go the way I want to, or am I just showing up and hoping I can wing my way to it? And that level of intentionality helps you be super successful, and I think that it's it's just a great reminder for all of us. Yeah. I I think the mistake that you can fall into is thinking that you're developing your reps because you show up for thirty minutes or sixty minutes every single week, and you happen to be physically present with that rep. But a lot of those one on ones, I think back ten minutes of it is really just gaining context, and that's a waste of their time and mine. And I almost wish that I did a biweekly one on one, a week a one on one every other week and spent that extra time prepping and actually developing my point of view instead of doing discovery work to figure out what we're gonna talk about in the first place. The other one that I really, really loved is when you have that prep, what you can do is he does the similar to KD, the rapid fire practice. He'll rip through 10 Gong calls and only do the last five minutes of the Gong call every single time. And the reason for that is because he's done the prep. He knows exactly where to zero in. So you can actually get five x the productivity in a one on one versus just sitting there reviewing one call figuring out what to talk about. Yeah. Cool. Well, alrighty, folks. Go connect with Sean on LinkedIn. And if you like this one, stay tuned for the next episode of the leadership edition. Cheers, folks.
