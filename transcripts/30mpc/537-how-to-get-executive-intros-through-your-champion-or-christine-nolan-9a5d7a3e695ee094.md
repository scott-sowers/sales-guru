## Transcript

When a champion offers to connect you with someone else in their organization, say that's wonderful. Let me ghost write you an email for them. Send a draft to them that day and they can do it in one click. The template I have here is, hey, champion. Thanks so much for offering to connect me with your stakeholder. Here's a draft that you can use. It removes any friction, and it increases the the chance that they'll actually make the introduction. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to the president's club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my co host Nick Skalski. And folks, we have someone who's made president's club four times leading enterprise sales teams. She leads the team that closed one of Asana's largest enterprise deals, $100,000,000 in contract value, which is absolutely nuts. And if you didn't know, it's kind of important to be able to multithread in enterprise deals, and this is a clinic on that. Her name is Christine Nolan from Asana. Nick, why should people listen? Unless you are selling the world's most transactional of transactional deals, you typically need to win over multiple stakeholders in an organization. Christine's AEs quite literally have, on average, like, six accounts in their book of business, and these are massive accounts. And so much of their job is using one stakeholder to get connected to other stakeholders, but also reprospecting the account even when they're already talking to other people to get into other pockets of the organization. And so if you sell in a motion that requires you to multithread, whether you are commercial or mid market or enterprise, enterprise, enterprise, you have something to learn from Christine around mapping power charts, handing your champion a whiteboard marker, using mind control in your introduction emails, and also understanding the political dynamics of the orgs you are selling to. This is a master class in multithreading. I'm pumped for this one. And three, two, one. We will take over the mind of Bob the champion. Begin. Alright, Christine. Welcome back to 30 MPC. You might remember that we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. So the first one is the whiteboard power map. So I'd say never let a conversation with a champion stay casual. When your champion starts talking about organizational challenges that they're working through or specific people, key stakeholders that you need to work with, stop and ask, can you show me? Or can you walk me through what that looks like? If you're in person, I've actually brought someone to a whiteboard and say, can you use this whiteboard and map out where you are and what you're talking about here? Then map out the org structure. If you're remote, you can also do it over, LinkedIn power map that you've created, ask them to correct you, or sometimes they might even show you, like, a work day org chart if you're a really good champion. And then get specific with the details. So who are they? Where do they sit? Why do they matter? Who are they connected to? Who has influence over them? So this really happens all the time. I had a champion that was in our office working before an event that we were hosting. And during lunch, I specifically brought up names that we had found in our research. And he said, hey. Let's go to a room. Do you have a whiteboard? I wanna make sure that you really understand who these people are and how we need to get in touch with them. So fifteen minutes later, we had the power chart mapped out with three new executive contacts that we needed to reach out to, and he offered to make the introduction. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. So this works at any deal size. It doesn't have to be an executive. It doesn't have to be a really big company. It can be even just a handful of people, and it helps you understand who you need to talk to to get a deal done. I love it. I just added buy whiteboard to my Amazon cart while you were explaining it. Love it. Number two, Christine. What's the next one? So they can't make it pivot that actually works. So what this is, a lot of the times you're going to a conference, you're going to an event, or maybe you're inviting someone to a dinner or an event that you're having. The contact response, amazing, wonderful, hey. I can't make it. Well, your response, don't let that sit there. You respond immediately, say, I'm so sorry I will miss you this time. However, I'm actually in the city for an extra couple of days. Do you have thirty minutes to meet for coffee anytime during this time? Or I'm sorry you can't come to this event. I'm gonna be flying out to your area in a month. Can we find some time then? So it really shows persistence without being pushy. It lets them know that you're committed to being with them and you wanna meet with them. And there's also social proof. You're already meeting with other customers in their area. It lowers the barrier to face to face. It's not a big dinner. It's not a big event. It's a fifteen minute, thirty minute coffee, and it makes it easier for them to say yes. Beautiful. Round us out, Christine. What's number three? Champion introduction. So make it effortless for your champions to connect you. You. When a champion offers to connect you with someone else in their organization, say, that's wonderful. Let me ghostwrite you an email for them. Send a draft to them that day, and they can do it in one click. The template I have here is, hey, champion. Thanks so much for offering to connect me with your stakeholder. Here's a draft that you can use. It removes any friction and it increases the the chance that they'll actually make the introduction. At Asana, I would draft an email that sounds like this for my champion. Hey, Bob. I've been working very closely with Asana over the last couple of months, working on, you know, increasing our efficiency with their AI functionality, and we've had some really great results that I think your team would benefit from. I wanna introduce you to my contact there, Christine Nolan, who can explain what we've been doing and help to see if there might be an opportunity for you. Done. So you wanna insert your, like, value driver, what you're doing for that team into that email. It also kinda psychologically like, when someone is willing to take what you've given them and put it out to somebody else in the world, it goes deeper in their head. They are a stronger champion, and they will use that same language in the future. So as we start to, put our hooks into Bob's brain in the sales cycle, I wanna talk about the whiteboard, which is probably one of the first places that this happens. So I'm wondering, you talked about mapping out the organization chart and, like, who's influenced by who on a whiteboard. Could you give an example deal story and explain what did the person draw or show you, and then how did you use that in your sales cycle? And this is a really good example of also why you need to be multithreaded. So I am not the sales rep on this deal. I'm the manager on this deal. And we in advance, we said, okay. Here are the different levels that we're gonna connect with, and here who makes sense from my level and from the company that we were working with for us to build a relationship. It also happened that this person is really amazing, and so it was a very easy thing to to build a relationship with them. But I built a relationship with a VP at a large Silicon Valley enterprise company. More old school. So the hierarchy and the power structure matters a ton. So people have been in their role for twenty years, and they may be chief of staff, but they may have more power than a VP who's been there for ten years, for example. And so when we were trying to figure out how did we need to get to other parts of the organization, because we were already in one part of the organization, and it was going really well. But we were having a hard time replacing an incumbent, very long term vendor that was in the rest of the organization and very embedded with IT. And so by having this relationship with the VP in one part, we were able to get him to map out the various parts of the other organizations and who is the ultimate decision maker and who had influence over that decision maker, what their priorities were, what they were focused on, and where he thought we might be able to provide them the most value. What were some of the questions that you asked this person to help fully build out this chart? Are you asking things around, like, champion versus detractor? Are you asking things about political influence? What are you doing to help coach them as they coach you? Yeah. So you wanna understand or get as much as you can from that person about what is important to the person you're trying to get in the introduction to. So, okay. Hey. I've seen I brought up the names. This person is the president. This person is the president. This person is the president. These two, to me, give an opinion, seem to be the most important people to talk to. Is that true? Let them correct you. Because when they correct you, they're gonna say, this person a 100%, they actually know, and here's why. And they'll give you more details than they would normally if you just said, like, tell me all the things I need to know. So you're asking, okay. This person's been in their role. What are they trying to achieve this year? How can we help with our technology them achieve that goal? What is their next role? What are they looking to do in their career next? Are they looking to make a name for themselves? Are they technically, like, recently promoted and so they need to prove themselves? Are they looking for their next promotion? The more you understand about that person, the better you can align your approach to their specific needs. This is really interesting because I think a lot of times in enterprise selling, we're taught to only think in terms of business objectives as if every single person in the company is addicted to earnings per share and quarterly earnings. But what you're talking about is, yes, you need to understand the company's business objectives, but you need to understand this person's personal objectives. In other words, what motivates them. And maybe one subset of that is they wanna hit the company goals, but there are probably a lot of goals that they have internally for themselves that will teach you how to best navigate a deal as well. And sometimes in large organizations, you know, maybe you have the hierarchy of, like, here's the company goal, but each division will have their contribution to that goal. But the directors and the VPs sometimes aren't even as aligned to that top line goal as as you think that they are. And so asking them of their version of it and how that attaches to it often is kinda one of those, like, double sided discovery questions where you learn something and they learn something as well. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. You've been selling these pretty complex, multiple, multiple stakeholder deals for a pretty long time, Christine. I'm wondering about some of the common political dynamics that you've observed when selling into big organizations and how you'll typically navigate some of those, oh, I've seen ones like these before. There's politics in every single organization, I will say, from small s and b to large enterprise. There's just more of them, and you have to understand how to work them. Typically, when you work with larger organizations, the people higher up are very adept at doing it. So one of the things that you need to understand is what version of politics is at this company, and how do you plug into that? So things like, yeah, who has the power, things like who has a preference on a technology that they're we used to call it, like, the fox in the room. They're not gonna tell you exactly how they feel. But when you leave the room, they're gonna tell everybody how much they hate you and how much better the other product is. And so first, how do you identify that person? Then how do you get them one on one to really, like, understand what what what keeps you up at night? Like, what is what is making your current process problematic? And then using that to kind of air any of their concerns before you get into a meeting with their peers. Because if they feel like they vocalized their challenges before, they don't feel like they need to as much or, like, do kind of an moment in the larger broader meeting. So you have to pick people apart. There might be 10 people involved, understand their influence, understand how they're connected to the other people in the deal, and then try to get everyone one on one as much as you can. And it doesn't have to be just with you as a seller. It can be with, you know, connecting, subject matter experts. Hey. I'm gonna connect my head of product with your product lead and make sure that you guys have the opportunity to talk and learn and network. Maybe it's not gonna work out, but I've just made a really great connection for you in the future. So don't limit it to just your selling team, but think about it more broadly with your the rest of your company and their company as well. Christine, I feel like there's no, like, tactical do these three things to get the inside scoop. I'm wondering if you have a deal example or a story where what did you do to get your champion to open up in that way? Like, how did you bring down the walls for your champion so that it felt safe for them to expose the political cap the political organization? It's about building trust. And the number of it's like, you know, when you're making new friends, it's the number of hours We've struggled with that historically here. That's why we have two hosts. Let me give you some advice. We we moved to a new area. We had to make new, like, parent friends who have little kids. And it just takes a while, like and it's quantity and quality. And so it's how often can you get yourself in front of the person for calls. There just becomes a familiarity. They build the trust in you. You are trying to show them that you're not just trying to sell them something. You're really trying to solve their problem. Getting in person. And I'll bring this back to a a deal in just a second, but there's often things that people say in person in between meetings that they will never say over a Zoom. And I know, like, a lot of sellers now, it's post COVID. There's so much more Zoom and so much more remote selling than ever before. But before, we didn't have Zoom, and we, like, picked up the phone, but we were in person all the time. We were, like, on the plane at their office taking them for lunch. And so one example, a deal that we did this summer, and it was a massive undertaking. And they were not going to continue working with us, And we had to completely change their mind, not only to not stop working, but, like, actually expand and replace another vendor, which we we did. But we identified a really key champion, wonderful person, and I'm not too far from their office. So whenever possible, I would offer to go out there where the rep wasn't local. So I said, hey. You know what? We're having this meeting. Why don't I come out and do it? Or I'd email the person and say, hey. I'm actually gonna be diving through your area. Do you wanna meet for lunch? And kinda taking down that barrier of this is only gonna be a business conversation and only gonna be a business relationship helped when we were at lunch. We spent thirty minutes talking about our children and about living out here, and then we spent five minutes talking about the deal. And those five minutes gave me so much more insight about what we needed to do and what our next steps needed to be than, like, probably the last four meetings that we had with this person. And so get in person, but also try to meet with the people as much as you can to build that trust so that they feel comfortable giving you those little gems. When you think about an enterprise deal, Christine, what would you say the ratio of one to one meetings, like, one on one meetings with a contact, to big team meetings where you've got, like, a group and you're presenting to a group are? There needs to be at least, like, three to one or four to one. Like, for what we have so there's often a, hey. We're gonna have a weekly meeting with the core evaluator group to move this forward. For every one of those weekly meetings, we have at least one one to one. And then there's the even larger meeting. So that's like the core group of evaluators that are working on this project. Then there's the how do we have the large executive meetings. So those are maybe once a month, whereas the core group is once every week, and the one to one is at least once a week, if not more. Where else do you think we should take it around multithreading or complex stuff, Christine? Is there anything where you're like, oh, I really want. This makes me think about something. Don't just limit yourself to where your champion says that you need to go. You know, everybody does prospecting. They look at who matters. Spend real time looking at, okay, this person just moved to this company from another company. What products did they use before? How will they have influence in this deal? We had someone with this deal this summer that I was talking about that my rep caught that was moving to this this company and asked proactively to connect with them. At that time, we also had someone who knew them from a previous organization at our company reach out to them over email. Congratulations on joining blah blah blah. It's really exciting for you. Like, I'm over here at Asana. Let me know if you have any questions. We're working really closely with your team. Completely outside of what the rep was doing. The rep is doing what he should, asking for permission. In theory, you know, you don't always have to ask for permission. But to your champion, you don't wanna betray their trust and, like, go around them too much. So saying, hey. I think this person might be an important person to bring along. And then they maybe learn, hey. This actually is an important person to bring along. We'll bring them into the next meeting. So you don't get bombarded by new people joining. Yeah. I mean, it's interesting. You're describing a system that I would run when I was selling ERP software to law firms where every day, the first two out two hours of my day were for what I considered, like, cold calling time, but they weren't all cold calls. Calls. From nine until ten, I would make net new prospecting calls, so cold calls. And then from ten to eleven, I would make my multithreading or in between calls where it was like you talked about you had that recurring meeting with the evaluators, and I'm like, I've got a deal. I've been talking to the COO of this law firm and the CIO for a while. I know there are these three IT guys that I probably need to try to catch. I'm gonna call them back to back to back. And I would make all these, like, in between calls, and they were still a little awkward because the IT director at this big law firm wasn't expecting to hear from me. But I had already, like, done the harder thing, which was made the cold calls. And so I had my cold call block and my, like, multithread expand the buying group call block. And that was a system that worked really well for me, and it sounds like your your reps are doing something similar, if not in the same system, but similar in, intent. My reps have anywhere from, like, literally two accounts, 10. And so but if they don't know everything about these accounts, they could be surprised, and that's a very bad thing. So we have people who we're connected to that have absolutely nothing to do with our deal. They're at the executive level, and they could be using our product, and they have influence in some way. And some of those, they just happen to be in a meeting, and it comes up. And they're like, oh, I had a meeting with the Asana rep a couple of weeks ago, and we're using them to roll out this new enablement, you know, for AI across the company. And that one little nugget of information in an executive meeting will go so much further than maybe someone that's lower down in the organization trying to push for you. So I would say, like, don't underestimate executives that you can be connected with even if they're not directly in the the buying process. What do you see if you look at those 10 accounts in an enterprise rep's book? What is the sign of an account that is engaged the right way or a healthy account that you know is, like, ripe for expansion? So there's a lot of different data points. It's not just any one thing. It's it's how many context do we already have. It's looking at your own, like, user information, how often are people using it, is it connected to core projects that they're working, to how many people do you know, how many people have you had meetings with, then looking at, okay, this account is right for expansion, external factors, how are they doing financially. What is their, like, brand marketing saying about what they're focusing on, and does that align with what we could do to help them? If it's everybody's talking about AI transformation now and how to be more efficient, are they hiring more people to do that? Where are those people coming from? What has been the turnover? So it's a bunch of different data points, and then you can actually put a weight on it. So you look at this is what we do. We look at accounts that have been successful in the past, and we say, okay. What made them kinda like for this one deal that we did this summer, new CIO who wanted to, like, enact change. What was a key thing that they wanted to do? AI transformation. Okay. How can we get connected to that CIO and make them see that we are a core part of them being successful in that? Can we spend a moment or two talking about how you are breaking in to getting meetings with important stakeholders at these accounts? Because you just shared with me reps have between two and ten accounts. There are going to be some stakeholders, champions. They'll take you around the org and get you insured to a lot of people. But I imagine you have some accounts in your AE's book of businesses where it's like, they talk to a couple people over here, but they're not gonna be able to get them to the new CIO or the org is just too big. And you've shared some gold in the past, Christine, around playing musical chairs at conferences, talking to people while you're washing your hands in the bathroom to try to get an introduction. Talk to me about how do I break in to not accounts, but specific human beings at some of these accounts? What is what are the strategies It's so hard nowadays too because people don't read email. Yeah. You can't just say, hi. I saw you were hired, and you have an AI transformation initiative, and we would like to discuss how we align with those goals. They're not gonna see it. So I, like, look for any possible in. You know, one of the, one of my former CEOs, he we were talking about someone high up at a a big company one time, and he said, oh, I met him once on, Marc Benioff's plane on the way back from a Salesforce conference, and this is what we talked about. And I was like, how how do you know how do you remember that? And this is, like, fifteen years ago or whatever. And he kept a log of everybody that he meets, when he meets them, and what they talked about. Now this is in the past, so he had, like, a Rolodex, and his EA would keep it up. But whenever I meet someone, I go and I add them on LinkedIn Mhmm. And I send them a note in my message saying it was great meeting you here. Mhmm. You know, looking forward to connecting. Sometimes they don't connect. That's fine. But I can always go back to that invite, and I can see that message that's there. As such, I have a lot of connections on LinkedIn. We were doing this, for an account just the other day, and I was one of my reps was like, I really wanna get in touch with this person. So I pulled it up, and I said, wow. I have nineteen first connections to this person. How how do I know this person? And I went through and I looked at who are my best connections and can I text them and ask them about it? So I literally texted three people and said, hey. You're connected to this person. Do you know this person at all? Two of them said no. I was just prospecting, and, like, he responded and Mhmm. Connected. The other one said, yeah. He was our key champion when I did this deal here. He's amazing. I haven't talked to him in a while, but, like, let's chat and see, you know, maybe if it makes sense to introduce you. By the way, I'm gonna be in San Francisco next week. You wanna meet for coffee. And I was like, great. Now I got an introduction, and I get to see an old friend and have a coffee with them, them, which is really wonderful. You can do this. Maybe you're not as connected, but what we do as a team is we'll have, like, an unblocking it's like Tuesday. Yes. So we put a contact or a couple of contacts, like a TLDR. Hey. Here's what's going on with the account. Here are five people that I'm trying to get in touch with, and we'll put it in the broader, like, top accounts team Slack channel. Mhmm. And then my ask of my team is to go in there and click on these people and see how they know them. Half the time, you'll get someone being like, oh, my husband went to business school with that person, or, oh, yeah. I actually sold to this person that also knows them. Let me try. And you know what? Let's say half the time or maybe three fourths of the time, you still don't get the person to respond. One out of four times, you'll get that connection and you'll get the person to meet with you, and that is, like, you've just, you know, saved yourself twenty hours of prospecting and cold calling just by doing that one thing. So don't let yourself limit yourself to just your own connections or just your manager's connections. This is great. You're teaching me how to make friends, coffee with an old friend, and break into my top accounts in multithread. I appreciate you. The clock is ticking. We gotta move to the final question. So the last question is, what is the biggest multithreading mistake that you see salespeople make that you think might actually be killing their deals? I think it's when and this happened to me. When you think you understand the power chain and you go around it slightly to try to get an extra meeting and I personally did this where I met with someone, a champion had introduced us, and I was trying to get a follow-up meeting with that person, and that person wasn't responding. So in that my response, I said, hey. We're also having a meeting with these other people. Totally, seemingly innocuous mention. And my champion called my phone and said, you don't do that. You don't understand the interplay of politics here, and that's actually gonna make that person less likely to meet with you. And so, like, you wanna be careful. You don't always wanna do exactly what your champion tells you to do, but you really wanna be careful in those very complex power dynamics not to step in it in a way that you think that you're gonna help yourself, and then I never got a meeting with that woman again. That's a heartbreaker. Christine, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a three step recap and one thing you can do. Alright. Three step recap. Number one, do not just look at LinkedIn and assume you know the org chart. Make sure that you literally pull out a white board or ask your champion to show their org chart and walk you through how it's structured. That's number one. Number two, within that, don't just understand the org chart as it stands. Understand the political capital. In other words, who has what amounts of power in the org chart, and who cares about climbing what ladders or accomplishing what missions within the organization. That will tell you what you need to do to motivate each person to buy. Number three, when it comes to actually breaking into that org chart, obviously, you wanna go through your champion, but you can't always do that. So if you can't go through your champion, number one, Christine mentioned top account Tuesday where they will point at all the people they want to get into at their top accounts and have their executives or other people at the company say, hey. I know Bob at this account. And then lastly, another strategy is if you do not have a large network, as you start meeting people, every time you meet someone, connect with them on LinkedIn and just say, hey. Great meeting you at this place at this time, and now you have a thread that you can pull back on to keep your network seeded. Alrighty, Nick. What's one thing people can do? You should action what Arman just described, which is if you're not already building your personal CRM of people that you've met with notes about how you met them, go back, look at the last quarter of meetings that you've had, Find the human beings that you met with. Send each of them a LinkedIn connection saying, hey. It was really great to meet you at the conference in San Francisco, and I enjoyed the iced latte that we shared together. I promise you, you will call back on that network for years to come. You might be coming back to thirty MPC to say thank you. Thank you. Thank you, future or past Nick. And, Nick, what's one thing people can steal? Well, if you liked what we talked about multithreading wise today, we are dropping a multithreading master class with the one, the only Jen Allen Knuth, and there is a link to register for that master class in today's show notes, and it's free. You've got a free master class. You've got mind control. You've got Jen Allen Knuth. What more could you want? Check the show notes. Register for that one. I promise it's gonna be a good one, and we'll see you next week on the show.
