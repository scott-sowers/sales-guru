## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have a round two with the one and only founder of Samsales. It's Sam McKenna. Nick, why should people listen? So Sam has some phenomenal stuff around parallel processing next steps in deals, how you should be thinking about getting to power and involving multiple parties both very early in the deal, but also late stage to accelerate the vendor review process so you are not stuck trying to get a contract signed on New Year's Eve. This was a very good one, Armand. Three, two, one. Let's roll. Alright, Sam. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. Thanks, Nick. Thanks for having me. Let's talk about first, are they presenting, asking, or telling? Who are we talking about? This is something we're talking about when we're specifically talking to a buyer that says, hey, we're gonna go in front of a board and we're gonna talk about your deal. Right? So we can't get your deal done until we present to the board. That's gonna happen in a couple of months. We'll let you know after that happens. Most people say, okay. That's great. You know? Nothing I can do until then. That's it. But here's the thing. You've gotta think about what is actually gonna happen when that person goes in front of the board. So one of the uncomfortable questions you have to think about when you're asking your buyer about this deal is number one, are you gonna be presenting, telling, or asking the board for permission? Are they presenting and waiting for feedback? Are they asking for permission to spend money with you? Or are they saying, hey, this is what we're gonna do? That's a key differentiator in thinking about how your deal is gonna move forward. And then add on top of that really quick, has this person presented a deal of this kind to the board before? Is there pushback? Are there questions that usually come up? Is there something that you can help them prepare for? Because if this is the first time they're doing it and they're presenting, not asking or telling, you're gonna be in for a different story for your deal than you probably thought. What's number two? Number two. Thinking about parallel processing with procurement. So let's say for the same deal, person comes back to you and says there's nothing we can do. I don't know. Let's say it's August. We can't do anything until this presentation happens in December. Great. Let's start talking to procurement. Can we get in front of procurement and get our MSA done? Can we go and do red lines? Can we understand how they buy, what the processes are, what stamps we need, what buying thresholds happen? Can we do all of that? And the buyer says we could, except we don't have approval yet to move forward. We won't have until the board meeting happens. And because procurement is outsourced, we can't do anything with them until we have these levels of approval internally. So, again, most reps would say nothing we can do. We can't touch procurement until then. So two things I would tell you to do here. Number one, make sure you have the meeting scheduled with procurement directly after that presentation happens. Right? There's absolutely no harm in getting the meeting scheduled. Not only will this help you make sure that you get on their calendar now before everybody else is trying to do it, But to make sure that you get on your own legal and procurement team's calendar right now, again, before everybody is rushing. The second thing, ask for a standard MSA. You've done this before, buyer, presumably. Right? So what are nonnegotiables? What do you guys never agree to? Do you have net 45 terms, net 60, net 90? Do you only do litigation in Delaware, Texas, California? What does that look like? Because here's the thing, whatever they want, we're not gonna ultimately agree to. We're gonna have to go through our own legal procurement, rev ops, sales ops to get certain things done. So do that all in advance and have all that documentation ready and the meeting scheduled way before you ever need to. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Round us out, Sam. What's number three? Alright. Let's think about who are the they's. Now the grammatically incorrect sentence makes a lot of sense. So I want you to think about whether you are a leader or whether you are a rep, every single time you hear the word they from your rep or from your buyer, we want you to ask yourself, do you know who is in that they? Is it they the the competition you have? Is it they the buying circle? Is it they the influencing committee? Who are the days? Because I think about every time I've heard that from a buyer, and the buyer says, hey, we're gonna look at this proposal. They're gonna take it back to the team, and then they're all gonna decide together. And I say, that sounds great. Thanks. What I really need to say is, that's awesome. Do Do you know who's in that buying committee? Who makes up those theys? And I ask because I wonder if part of those are people who have been our clients before, if they have mutual connection with our executive team, if they've worked with our CS team before. Right? If you, buyer, are serious about working with us, tell us who those they are because, man, we'll be able to figure out who they know, what experience they have, and help this deal move along. Same thing on the competition. Right? When we hear they about the competition, they are submitting their proposal. They are going to answer the questions that we have buying COB Friday. Who are those they's? We have to find that out because if we don't know who the competition is, we're aiming in the dark. Imagine if we're selling, I don't know, a $250,000 car, and and they say we're gonna look at the competition. We don't know who that is. And then we later find out, I don't know, it's a Prius and maybe a 1989 Honda. Great cars. Maybe not good competitors for our quarter of $1,000,000 car. Figure out who those theys are, and you'll open up a whole series of information that you need to know to get your deal done. Sam, that first takeaway is amazing. When someone's like, I'm going to the board. How do you suss out if they're presenting, asking, or telling? I think what you need to think about is change the lens of how you look at this partnership with your buyer. We are so uncomfortable in asking uncomfortable questions because we don't wanna upset anybody. We don't wanna step on toes. If you instead about think and said that it's you versus them, think it's you two in cahoots. Right? They want your software solution technology, whatever it is, as much as you want, let's be honest, their money and their revenue. Right? When you go into this board meeting, one, is this the first time you've done this? And two, are you presenting, do you have to ask for permission? Are you telling them, like, because you have authority to do this? Tell me about that simply by asking this. Right? You're hopefully going to open up the conversation for them to be honest with you, tell you exactly what's going on and for you to think about those questions that are forthcoming, those objections that they're going to get. You can build an analyst for them. You are going to make sure that they are prepared as all get out for this presentation or hopefully this. Now, if you think about that advice and you're like, oh, that makes me cringe, that may also be a sign that one, you don't feel like this deal has as many legs as it does or, two, that you haven't built the relationship enough with this buyer. Well, we talk about all the time. Understand your buyer, who they are, not only as a wallet shareholder with somebody with WellCare, but also who they are as a human being. Get to know them, build that rapport, and then you can earn the right to ask those questions. Could you give an example of a deal or maybe a story where you sent some hesitation in their response? This is something that happens when we listen to discovery calls and we listen to calls that move further along all the time. We hear the hesitation because the the rep is really just pushing and pushing a particular solution that hasn't been vetted correctly. So maybe that buyer just says, you know, we're making our presentation of the options on December 12. A person hears, you know, happy ears. They think that this is going to move forward. They throw it and commit. We hear the hesitation there from the buyer to give any additional information because they're probably not right sure that that's the opportunity that they're going to go with or the solution they're going to go with. Again, this is why just in the very beginning, right, the discovery works that you do, asking open ended questions, broad questions about the true business plan they have is so critical. So we can really understand who we're dealing with and if this opportunity is worth our time. Sam, let's make this real. I sold accounting software to law firms for a very long time. And very often, the CFO or the COO of the law firm that was looking at our solution would be making a presentation at the quarterly meeting of all of the partners of the law firm. I'm in that conversation with CFO, and they're like, hey. On December 12, we're gonna be giving a presentation to the partners of all the options. They tell me we're gonna be presenting options. What should I be asking them, and what are some of the other questions I should be asking them to help them have a better presentation and help sway the deal in my favor? The first thing I would do, especially because you sold accounting software to law firms, right, and you understood the law firm and the professional services space, which is one that I specialized in for a very long time, The first thing you should do is make sure that they understand your expertise in their space. So you can leverage that to earn the right to ask these questions. So number one to say, you know, the last time I worked with K and L Gates, the last time I worked with Scadden, right, one of the things that came up was partners always seem to ask this. The managing partners or the buying committee, right? The executive committee asked this and this and this. Have you guys heard those questions before? Is that important to your firm? Tell me about that. The second thing that often comes up, and I know every firm is different, but when we think about this, do you is this all within your authority, or is this something that needs a majority vote in terms of spend volume? Right? What does it look like for you guys? Right? Is this ultimately your decision, or do we need to get some buy in? The other thing to think about is how can I help you prepare for that meeting? As you guys have presented, you know, software that you wanna purchase before, what questions come up? What objections come up? I know sometimes firms have one or two very persnickety and skeptical partners. Do you guys have that in your group, and how can I prepare you for their questions to make you look like a star? Using the language that feels authentic not only to you, but then also that that fits the personality of that person. But, again, you are helping your deal get across the line, but at the end of the day, you're trying to make them look better by being prepared as they can be. So there's also gonna be some scenarios where somebody goes, hey. I'm not gonna be presenting. I'm not taking these options back on December 12. I'm gonna be telling them this is my recommendation for us moving forward. How does the conversation differ there with your champion? I I think you asked them the same question that your leader or that you should be asking yourself. Why won't this deal get done? What's your perspective right after you say, we're gonna buy the software. It's a multiyear deal, and we're gonna buy it for $5,000,000 over the course of three years. Why do you think that won't get done? Any objections that you can anticipate? Any pushback you can anticipate? Are there relationships maybe that others have with particular software firms that we need to think about? What can I do to prepare you for this? Maybe knowing what you've known from presenting, options like this before. The other thing I would focus on again is thinking about the procurement process for whatever spend volume you're getting at. Some people don't think that this is something that they have to go through depending on the size of the organization and the price of the software. But let's say even if you are presenting to a multi billion dollar organization of Fortune 500, oftentimes it's the opposite of what you'd expect. Procurement's tougher, spend thresholds are lower, Right? And you need 16 different stamps from 14 people who are all gonna be on PTO at varying times to get your deals done. So ask those questions as best as you can. I thought one of the other things that Sam does really, really nicely there is you're not just asking the, hey. What's Matt gonna ask you when you go in the room? You are suggesting for them, hey. Might it be that there's others that have relationships with other software firms that, like, might sway their opinion on things? You're almost giving them a couple options. Because if you just ask the big high level question of, like, what resistance might there be? It's hard for them to do the full search of every possible combination and permutation. But if you say here's some common resistances, they can pick some of those and you can talk about them, but it also starts to jog their thoughts. I do wanna double down on what you just said, Nick, really quick because I think it's important. This is part of every single part of our sales process is that suggestive capability. If you just said what are the questions that are going to come up, you're going to get what's already been in their buckets or what's in their minds right now. We lose deals all day long, and we know why we lose deals all day long. Right? We have that basket of here, the 78 reasons I lost deals this year. So think about those things as they would apply to this vertical, this buyer, the size of deal and suggest that stuff. Right? People say all the time, how do I multi thread without being salesy? Nick's the ultimate decision maker. I'm talking to Arman. How the hell do I get to Nick without stepping on Arman's toes? Start asking questions that Arman can't answer instead of being like, what's Nick gonna care about? Think ask these very specific questions that you know a buyer like Nick would care about and that Nick probably would be the only one to answer. What are the priorities for this year? What are you guys forecasting? What's the growth? How are you what's the roadmap? How are you gonna get there? Ask these specific things that Armand's gonna say, you know what? Nick's probably a better person to answer those questions. Why don't I bring him in? And he'll be like, that would be super. Today's show was brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. So how do you broach that conversation? Because every once in a while, you're champions of a buffoon. And, like, unfortunately, you're selling to a buffoon, and it happens. And I've sold to a people leader where I'm like, I know this head of people has to be the person that's gonna talk to the CFO. It's they're not a champion. They're just a champion that I know has no political clout. So I'm asking them all these questions. They're like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. How do I get them to pull me into that meeting instead of taking it alone? One of the things that I think is really cool about sales is that you can use language to your advantage. So we talk about this all the time, hashtags semantics matter. So one of the things I love to do there is to say, why don't we do this? Armand, I probably filled your head with all these questions and you're probably frustrated with how often you're saying, I don't know. Do you think Nick would have a better sense of these these answers? Like could we loop him in? Or I also wonder if your SDR leader would have some great, you know, things to share about their frustrations, kinda what they wanna do differently. Why don't we do this? Why don't we grab another time to chat? I've got a couple of things I wanna mention. I said, I'm gonna actually include our CS leader who I think will have some really great perspectives on this. And then why don't we grab Nick and, you know, buffoon number two over on your SDR side to come over on our call. How does that sound to you? This will also give you a good temperature check. Are you talking to somebody that's just gonna buffoon your buns off, right? And be a gatekeeper the entire time or do they actually have authority to help make decisions here to bring in multi threads, right, and to move it forward? Because we have talked to those people and if you talk to just that person again and you don't figure out how to multi thread, you are going to do nothing but waste your time. So come hell or high water, why don't we do this and suggest the other people to bring in? Can we go to the suggestion that you made, which was asking our buyers questions that they don't know the answer to. This is something that I've struggled with in my career. I sell all of our sponsorships for thirty minutes to presidents club. And, usually, we need someone who's at least a VP level, maybe even a CMO, to approve our level of spend. Usually, our deals start with a marketing manager, and that person wants to collect a lot of information from us. They wanna know about our audience and our demographics and our pricing and the activations. And And nine times out of 10, when I give them all of that information, they take it back to their boss, and I have a closed lost deal that Armand is yelling at me about and saying, go back and go higher. Buffoons can sell too. Who would've known? How should I be running those initial conversations or two with the manager level folks in these deals. I think help educate them on the objections that you're already going to get. So let's say, right, the objection what's the most common objection that you get? Sometimes we get, we don't have budget for this. Our budget's already, already, you know, allocated to whatever. Now I would argue, right, a lot of the time that from a budget perspective, it's just because we didn't prove value. So let's say we get on, you know, with the marketing manager and we say, I'm gonna run you through our demographics and things like that. I wanna ask you just a couple quick questions. So one, mostly around budget. Right? Sometimes we get pushback from our buyers who say, we don't have budget allocated for this, and we have to get creative with them about where to pull budget from. When you think about your sponsorships or even thinking about all the different buckets where your marketing dollars go, what's your sense on what's been the most successful? What hasn't had great ROI? Like, tell me a little bit about that. Oh, well, I really only see sponsors oversee sponsorships. Tell me who does your syndicated third party content. Tell me who does your pay per click campaigns? Can you talk to me about that? Should we bring them on the call? Because I think, right, one of the great conversations we can have when we work with your broader team is thinking about the places where ROI just isn't clicking and pull budget from those places to help you get sponsorship of our podcast. Any thoughts there? Just start to think about those questions. Right? If you wanna work with us, we gotta be creative. I think it's so smart what you're doing is you are raising that roadblock, and you're not afraid to have that uncomfortable conversation of like, hey. Usually, this is an area that and you're saying this really, really early, maybe even before you've proven all the value of what you do. You're saying we're probably gonna have to get creative, and we might need to pull from some of these other areas. And I feel like you're also helping them expand their scope in their mind of, like, who actually gets impacted by something like this. You mentioned the folks running the paid ads, the folks doing syndicated third party content, which isn't normally folks typically have a far more narrow lens in terms of how they're thinking about whether it's a sponsorship, an accounting software, or whatever people are buying. What you have to think about all the time is that people are coming to calls with you not for their health. There's an actual challenge that they have to solve. There's something they're looking to accomplish. So what is that? What's the budget that you have available for it? What are other budgets that we can pull from? And and I think just an important takeaway, especially even for our senior sellers, the amount of times that we hear back again budget was a concern or budget wasn't allocated for this. Well, no shit budget wasn't allocated for this, especially if it's something new that you're selling, but you have to figure out how to partner and multi thread to pull from different budgets. And it may not even be what you think. Perhaps, right, you're thinking about how to sponsor something, thirty minutes to presidents club, as a great way to attract new talent. Can we talk to HR? Can we talk to your chief people officer? What are you guys doing to bring in fresh young minds? Because I'll tell you, our demographic maybe is 6% VP, but the BDRs that are really investing in themselves, the AEs to better themselves, they're listening to our podcast. So think about that. Right? What are creative places where you can get money? I was running into this issue the other day where a founder was about to multithread. So they're about to go from champion up to power, and they actually got to power on the second call. And the problem was the champion wasn't convinced yet. Mhmm. So literally, the champion was they still had both vendors in their head, two or three vendors in their head. They're like, this one's more expensive. This one's less expensive, whatever it is. And what he actually ended up doing is for future deals who were like, let's delay multithreading up until we can at least say that we have one or two people bought on board. And so I I wanna get your reaction on that. At times, does it make sense to slow down that presentation of power to get your ducks in a row, or do you wanna get in front of power as soon as possible? I would always start with power if you can. So maybe just a quick caveat there, right? Don't be afraid to go up the food chain. And again, one of the things we talk about with our show me, you know me methodology is that you have to basically put in the effort to do research, write a great subject line. People are like, well, how does that scale to 400 marketing managers? It doesn't. You just go to the CMO and you say, here's what we can do for you and then work your way down. The part just by the way that I love about that is if I let's say Nick is the CMO. Right? And I go to Nick and he says, go to Arman. Now when Arman either blocks me, doesn't respond to me or whatever, not only can I go back to Nick, but I can also just keep Nick abreast of what's going on because Nick introduced me to Arman? So go up first and then work your way down. The part I love about sales is that it's an art. Right? It takes your EQ into account. It takes you really understanding the dynamic of relationships and people to get ahead. So take each opportunity that you have in a different way, I would just say. Like, think about what that person's like, what you need to do, If they are, skeptical of you, if they already have relationships with other vendors, you've gotta really suss that out. But more than anything, show up to the call to solve a challenge. So don't come and say, tell me about your the landscape that you guys have going on over there. Tell me about your challenges. Tell me about the issues you're trying to solve. What are the initiatives you have ahead? I'd love to hear about you guys first. Let them data dump on you and really look to solve their challenges because if you make that investment in them like no other reps do, truly, they're gonna take you to power pretty quickly, hopefully, if they're the right buyer to begin with. But but start there and then feel it out. I say more often than not, faster that you can multithread and get to power, the better. Even if it's not power, multithread double the quantity of the people you have on the call. Get two marketing managers on the next call instead of just one. It doesn't always have to be up. Yeah. The the way that I think about it as well is you might have to multithread us before you multithread up. And to me, that's the more conservative path. But you shouldn't just stick with someone who's not convinced for 20 steps and wait for them to be convinced. That might mean you don't send them to the board on day one, but you should actually still go and try to get some other allies in your deal cycle. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. The last to go back to is actually your second takeaway, which is all of this has been talking about getting to power, getting approval, and there's another step that can slow down the deal that happens after this, which is a three month vendor review with procurement and legal and security. And everyone knows or many people know that the best reps are parallel processing vendor review during the evaluation. And so talk to me when is the right time for me to start parallel processing vendor review. I think, again, as soon as you have what you need to know that this deal is going to move forward. So whether you subscribe to Banton, you've got all of that figured out, whether the buyer has said we are moving forward with you. I am telling the board what I am doing, and it is gonna happen on December 12. Whatever it is for you to need to know and for your leaders to know that this is a 90% commit deal, 75% commit deal, whatever it is. Once you get there, you've got to think about how do you speed up that process, right? Because by the time if you're parallel processing this paperwork, by the time the decision happens, by the time the person comes back from vacation, that's going to sign your MSA, whatever that is, you're going to have 95% of the paperwork done. I also just think about the personal pride that I have as a seller of being able to go to my leader and say, here's what we need to do. It's August. Deal's not gonna happen until December, but I've gotten this checked off. I've gotten our MSA's red line. I've gotten 17 people on our side to prove the nine things that are not gonna be doable on their end. I am as locked and loaded as I possibly can be. And then I'm still working with my leader to say, why won't this deal happen? What else haven't I thought of? Right? The last deal I needed to get to my first president's club was with Teva Pharmaceuticals, and it's when I learned that there was a stamp that was needed by some obscure procurement team, and I didn't know this. Right? I mean, this was gonna cost me my first president's club. So even making sure, talk with your peers, talk with cross functional leaders. If your leader is a buffoon, talk with other leaders and say, what am I not thinking of? Right? Also the importance of sponsorship internally and mentorship internally. Go and meet with a top performer. What haven't I thought of? Make sure you figure that stuff out so you can be thinking about all the stuff right before you get to that end goal where you you instead of going back and be like, crap. I wish I'd thought to do that. You know, put in the work. Other than late stage vendor review, let's actually go backwards to earlier in the deal. What are some common places that you recommend sellers have parallel next steps rather than sequential next steps? I think one really great thing is to think about the other cross functional teams that you'll be working with. So even as you think about, you know, we're gonna move this up the ladder, we're gonna talk to our leaders about it and get that approved. Let's say we're talking about a multiyear deal, and we know that as soon as we sign, our CS team is going to kick in or our AM team is going to kick kick in. Are you also multi threading across those teams? Have you brought in your CS, your AM team? Have you brought in NAM manager? Have you gotten your executive leader to get a meeting with that executive leader, let's say, on the other side? These are all things that you can do to start them multithreading, but also to build those relationships. I think the other thing just as we're waiting on other next steps, and people really miss this for enterprise deals, is to make sure that we have recurring meetings happening. So, again, if we're in August, let's say, and we're still forecasting this for year end December, what I want you to think about is how much work and continued poking and prodding needs to happen to get that deal done. So do you have a meeting with legal and procurement on your teams every week, every other week? So that we're holding ourselves accountable to these are all things you can be doing again to keep that deal moving and to keep the relationships building in parallel. I love how you're pulling so many of these plates earlier, the cross functional aspects, the procurement aspects, the legal aspects. And, folks, oftentimes, I have the exact same rule, Sam, which is I start trying to parallel process the moment I feel like we're selling on the same side. So the moment I'm like, okay. We're on the same side of the table, and it's not I'm trying to win you over anymore. It's like, alright. That's when we start parallel processing. But sometimes that happens later than you want. And so there are still things you can do early in your deal cycle to sort of get sneaky and start vendor review. For example, you can get an NDA signed early in your deal cycle, and that will usually at least get you on the radar of legal. Oftentimes, what we would do is we would, like, spin up a trial portal or we would spin up a demo instance for someone, and that oftentimes kicks off a lightweight security review. And it just, like, gets the IT review started earlier than you would need to. So get creative and figure out all these ways that once you get good at closing deals, if if you're good at closing a deal in four months, your next task is not to just figure out how to close all of those deals and close more of those deals. It's figuring out how to close your four month deals in two months, and that's where the best sellers actually make it to club. I think you just said something else, I think, that also might perk up some ears, security review. Right? So depending on how you're moving through the your organization, if you just got promoted, let's say, from SMB to commercial commercial enterprise, you might have never heard of something called an infosec review, right, or security review. You that might be the very first time you're hearing an acronym like that. So, again, I think the importance of working with cross functional partners internally, why won't this deal get done? If you went to Arman and he was like, well, did you do infosec yet? And you said, what is that? Just easy ways for you to learn and be proactive about the way you chase this. Wow. Sam, we're gonna need to have you back. This was one of the best ones in a long time, and sadly, we are running out of time. So we gotta move to the final question. Final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them or that it helps? Sending calendar links in your outbound emails. Dear god, don't do it. Two quick things on this. Number one, if you send a calendar link, it is presumptuous. Number two, you're putting the onus on that the buyer to schedule time with you. If you really, really wanna be selfish in the way to think about this as you object and say, but it's so convenient now, here's what you wanna think about. Instead, you are letting a buyer circumvent all of your personal stuff on your calendar. Your one on ones, your daily massage, trust me, All the things that you have to do, you're making them circumvent that instead of saying, you tell me when you're free, and I will make that time work. Some way, come hell or hot water. Don't do it. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap email from this episode with Sam McKenna. What do you have for your two? The first is the recurring meeting. You will eventually, in complex deals, get to a stage where you and your champion are selling together, and you are probably going to need to meet with them on a regular basis to get intro to multiple different parties, to cover different questions and items on their list. Number two is set next steps in parallel, not sequentially. You do not need to just have one next step on the book if the next next steps are not contingent upon that next step. The example Sam shared was if you have next steps with different cross functional groups, customer success, the technical team, the attorneys at the law firm that you're selling to. If those aren't dependent upon each other, get them all scheduled now because now you start to create some momentum in your deal, and everything moves faster. Number three. You need to figure out if your prospect is going to present to the board, ask the board, or tell the board they're buying this thing. And if someone is presenting to the board, then that means you have a lot of work to do with your champion, and you need to unpack their concerns and prepare them for the questions they're gonna get from their financiers. Number four. If you want to get access to power, you can start asking your champion the questions that they don't know the answer to. All of the things that a CFO or a board member is going to bring up, prompt those to your champion. And when they don't know the answers to them, you're like, hey. Is this something that Nick might know the answer to? And that's your end. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So one of the topics that we talked about in this episode was the idea of driving timeline late in the deal, but also early in the deal, some things that you could do. Arman, I know recently you wrote an article for our 30 MPC newsletter on how to drive timeline in sales. There's a link in the show notes if y'all wanna check it out. It's free. It's got a lot of Arman's best stuff around driving timeline. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
