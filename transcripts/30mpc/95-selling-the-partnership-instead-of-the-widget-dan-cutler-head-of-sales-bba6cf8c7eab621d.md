## Transcript

Good morning, everybody. And welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Ferg. I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski, and we have a man who sells multimillion dollar deals, the one and only Dan Cutler. Nick, why should people listen? I used to think that solving the pain of the customer was the most important thing that I should be talking about in my discovery calls, and Dan set the record straight with me. We talked a little bit a lot a bit about the how an organization buys and how that facilitates really, really impactful discovery. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Dan. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Yeah. So my number one is, when focusing on doing larger transactions at big companies, you should be trying to find out how that company buys just as much as you're trying to fit your solution into the why. Right? And so the bigger the company, the more federated the organization, the more stakeholders need to be addressed and covered and really focusing on how a company makes purchasing decisions will be key in your success. Beautiful. What's number two, Dan? So number two is really sort of simplifying your sales process and your qualification process by understanding why companies buy. Right? So the how is number one. Number two is the why. And it's always two reasons. It's to save money or make money. And indexing and trying to learn about which of those two are there will dramatically alter your sales cycle. And so upfront, you should be trying to find out the why. And if it's not saving money or making money, it's probably not valuable enough to make a purchasing decision. Beautiful. Round us out, Dan. What's number three? Cool. Pricing, quotes, that's your leverage as a salesperson, and you deserve leverage from your clients. Your leverage from your client should be information in turn for providing resources in the form of technical assistance. But as a sales rep, the thing you provide and the thing you hold tightest is the price of your solution. And the moment you give that up and you haven't gotten the leverage that you deserve in return, you'll never get it back. So keep in mind that pricing is your biggest leverage to the seller. So let's talk about that one a little bit more. So I come into a meeting and I'm like, damn. Great. This sounds really good. Before we go any further, I have to know a sense of what this thing costs. How do you respond? Yeah. So I'd say, you know, if someone asks you for pricing as a initial sort of introduction to a relationship, unless you're selling a full commodity service, unless you're selling a wrench or a book, you probably don't have enough information in order to accurately quote that person. And whether or not that's actually the case or not, I encourage people to say, I don't know what you wanna buy yet. My product or my solution is nuanced. I assume your requirements are nuanced. Let me make sure that I understand exactly what you're trying to accomplish to make sure I can actually solution and then price you effectively. Otherwise, we would likely be wasting each other's time. So I would normally just dig back into the requirements as a prerequisite and even to get pricing. And in many ways, that's a deferral, but that's okay. Right? You do need to defer because you don't know if it's worth your time to give up pricing or the other requests that that customer may have. And the other school of thought that I've heard related to that is that if you give a range on pricing and the customer's like, okay. You know, you tell them it's between 20 and $40 a head, and they're like, oh my gosh. I thought it was gonna be $3 a head. We could never afford that, and it's like a legitimate thing. You're then, like, qualifying, and you're not wasting your time any further on that. And so I guess how do you reconcile wanting to actually qualify the opportunity with wanting to hold on to your leverage to get what you need as a salesperson? Yeah. I mean, look. I think, in my opinion, no one has ever lost a valuable strategic sales pursuit in losing out on price as an initial communication with a potential client. Meaning, if the conversation ends at that point, it was not gonna be fruitful to begin with because this is not a serious buyer who has complex requirements that require a complex solution. Right? And so there's lots of sellers out there. We all have quota. We all have sort of our near term goals. But if someone says, I'm not gonna talk to you anymore because your widget cost too much, and they're not giving you the time to actually learn about your widget and in turn sharing information about the problem they're trying to solve. If they close the door at that point, just imagine that it was never gonna be open to begin with because it wasn't, in my opinion. Right? Easier said than done. I've been in that situation many times to comment on your range if you are forced to say, hey. What's the price? The range is a valuable option that if you have to use it because then in turn, you're forcing them to give you information to further qualify to see what requirements they have to fit. That's why people suggest the range. When do you know you are in a good place to give price in a sales cycle? You can ask yourself, what are the things that I need to know in order to feel like this is an actual worthwhile pursuit and that the customer has what I need to do a transaction? Typically, in tech sales, there's usually about three things that that I look for. One would be technical validation. Right? And that's probably the simplest one to focus on. Does my product meet requirements? What are your requirements? Can we both look at each other and agree that your problem is a valuable one to solve and that my solution solves that? That. So technical validation is number one. Second would be budget. Is this a problem that has been funded by the business? Does it need to be funded by the business? Do you have the ability to get funding? How empowered are you, mister and missus customer? And the third would be, and this is typically when selling to a larger company, is that that first conversation is probably not gonna come with someone that has a scene in front of their title or even a VP in front of their title or maybe even a director. Right? And so ensuring there's alignment from those people that ultimately own the larger budget or the larger strategy, ensuring that they are in tune with the desire to potentially purchase a product to solve this problem is super valuable. So, again, easier said than done to get all three of those things before you just give up pricing, but those are the things I'm looking for. And let's say you get one out of three and you give up pricing, that's a bigger hole than if you get two out of three. If you give it up under zero out of three, you're in big trouble. Right? Because they could go shop something else to someone else and then give up more information and build a tighter relationship with one of your competitors. So those three is usually how I sort of dumb down the sales cycle for myself. So, Dan, let's say that we found ourselves with a director level buyer. Right? And so you have a director level buyer you're working with, and you know that there's technical validation based on the problems they have, but you're not sure if this person even has the ability to get budget or, frankly, even knows how to buy software. How do I go about convincing that person not to shot me around laterally to every other director in the company, but rather to shoot me upwards? Because a lot of people get defensive when it comes to that stage of the game. Yeah. I'd say, you know, two responses there. The first is, you haven't heard this before, hear it now, don't accept a no from someone that can't say yes. Right? And vice versa. Right? Don't accept a yes from someone that can't say yes either. But, secondarily, I'd say this is why we don't sell alone. This is why hierarchies exist. This is why we don't sell by committee and we don't sell one to one unless, you know, you're a a traveling salesperson with selling encyclopedias is align those people with similar titles. Right? And so if you have a relationship with your champion who's a director and you don't wanna step on their toes to get to a c level, hopefully, the company you work for has valuable resources in the form of executives who are knowledgeable that would be a valuable person to align to that VP or that c level executive. Right? And so this is why we say never sell alone, certainly not on a very large deal where those people will eventually need to be involved to get a transaction. What's the right way to frame that up? Am I supposed to be saying, hey. We're never gonna get this in your hands if I don't talk to other people? Because even the way that I voiced that over, I feel like that's a little bit demeaning to say it that way. Yeah. I think it goes back to to my first sort of point is asking, how does your company make purchasing decisions? Right? If your champion in this scenario, Nick, you know, who's frothing to get the solution is empowered, then they can make the transaction directly with you. A little bit less empowered would be mean they have the reputation and the ability to get to someone that can make a broader purchase. Right? And if they don't have that ability, then you don't have the right champion. Right? I think that champion development is an important part of doing transactions. This should be seen as an opportunity for that person to come up with a great solution to solve a valuable problem that the leadership of that company has not solved yet. And you should guide them and say, like, I wanna help you bring this internally and put your name on it as well because you're identifying a problem that can probably, you know, solve many problems across the greater org. Right? So it's challenging when that person hasn't played that role in their organization before. I think we need to provide a lot of empathy to the buying journey as well. We think that selling stuff is hard. Buying stuff is hard. Right? And helping those people understand even how to buy in their own company is is really the art of selling and certainly more important as you go upstream into enterprise and larger organizations. So, Dan, oftentimes with these director level or even a VP level person at a really large company, you're going to be doing more technical discussions. You're probably bringing in a sales engineer or what have you. Your discovery is probably less on the big picture vision type of stuff and more on the technical problem side of things. But then when you get up to the CIO who you're selling to, your discovery and demo process changes. So I'm I'm curious. Once you get to that level, it's your first meeting with that CIO. What are you doing differently relative to the conversations that you're having below the line? I think going into the CIO's office and trying to have a really keen understanding of what matters to this person and what matters to the business will dictate your narrative in that meeting. And, certainly, having that person leave the room knowing that this solution and and this partner in the sales rep in this company can help our company meet our goals, which are either save or make money. Right? And simplifying it will really help you sort of keen into your messaging. So I wanna focus on, like, how do you kick that meeting off? You walk into the office or you show up on the Zoom. Like, what are you saying to Armand to have the conversation start so you can focus on those, like, important things and also demonstrate that you're not just some, like, schmuck of a sales rep who's gonna waste Armand's time and he never will meet with again? Yeah. I'd say the advice there is you shouldn't be leaving the conversation talking. I think it's been a while since I've had the microphone in a a c level meeting. The question I would usually ask is before we start talking at you, we'd love we'd love for you to provide your perspective on why you're really in the room with us today, what matters to you, what you wanna see out of this session. And people love talking. They love talking about themselves. They love talking about their business. They love talking about their priorities. I think most of your listeners are are probably well versed enough if they're in tune with with trying to better themselves at sales that they know now the worst thing you can do when you get a a sales meeting is to start talking without further qualifying. That person could say something completely different than you expected, which can totally change the narrative of your meeting and what you're gonna present. And if you don't take that opportunity to get more information, ultimately, more leverage, you've done yourself a big disservice. Alright. So let's keep this ball rolling on this front. So our favorite way to start the call is to just ask why the heck did you take the call in the first place. They start going on and on and on. Could you give us a sense of, like, what might be something that someone would say? And then what may be a question or two that could follow based on what they've told you is is important to them? I'd say, like, let's pretend we're selling collaboration or productivity software, and a CIO might say, I have two functions here. One function is to support the business and make sure that our people across every single business line is most efficient as possible. And my second function is where, if at all possible, to also create the best experience for our customers. So this person hypothetically could say, look. I'm trying to support a work from home model. I have a million old tools. A lot of them aren't scaling. A lot of them aren't working. And if they lead with that, you say, like, is that the most important reason that you're here to talk to us today is that you wanna improve the way that people are communicating and try to modernize the tools, whether or not it's documents or voice or audio or collaborative documents or the 900 other productivity tools that we all have or consolidating those productivity tools. Right? That would be where you keen in. But I would always hold that second part close and try to find a revenue generating initiative as well. Is your company creating an app for a certain subset of your users that maybe my product could be introduced as a microservice that could modernize and run that app? Can you partner with us? If you're a banker, you're a health care company, you're probably good at at being a bank or being a health care company. You're probably not great at creating apps or creating digital experiences from your customers. Can we partner there? Right? I think that the best places to sell right now are solutions where you can kinda hit both. Right? You can solve a how to get my day done problem for an employee as well as, oh, wow. I could use this to improve the experience of my customers, my end customers. Right? And I'll I'll tell you for sure, a CIO wants to play that role. Second role, they don't wanna just be a portfolio manager. Right? And so keying into their aspirations is also a good idea to be more than just a seller and more than just a a widget seller. Awesome. And so let's say that I've identified some of these big initiatives that they're working on. I've gone through the discovery process. I've gotten many folks on board, and I have my technical validation. I know there's budget, and I know there's power. Now it comes to actually coming to the pricing table. And I know you have some tactics around maximizing deal size. So I'm curious if you could share what are the different ways that I can go about maximizing the ARR that I'm bringing in. Yeah. I think it it goes back to leverage. How expensive is the problem you're trying to solve, or what is the opportunity for maximizing that? Look. It's all about upfront qualification for how you close the deal, but but how much you maximize the size of your deal. If you're replacing something that is much more expensive than what you offer, you know, you don't need a discount. Right? If you have that information. If you're selling a product that is going to enhance the solutions that customer offers their end customers and you're gonna make them $50,000,000 and your product only costs $30,000,000 you probably don't need to discount that much, right? The strength of the business case is what dictates the pricing power that you have and those are our details that should be uncovered upfront And then we again, like, we have the hard challenge of trying to meet near term goals and hold leverage and customers know how to buy and they're savvy. Right? But, again, I just have to there's no quick bullet on how to get the most expensive price for your product. It's through really hard work, qualification, and leverage building that probably starts during the first conversation you have with that client. Dan, one of the things that I've heard is that I can justify a higher price ARR when I affect more functions in the business. And the more people that I talk to, the more stakeholders that I talk to at the business, the more ability I have to uncover ways to affect those functions. And so I imagine that your team is going, and they're talking with multiple different stakeholders across different functions, but not every single person is at every single meeting. And so I have to assume you're learning things about the business, problems that exist that you solve, that not everybody is aware of. And I'm curious to hear your approach and your team's approach to making sure that the CIO knows that you're gonna be able to help the CFO with something really, really big to help justify that bigger deal cost. Yeah. I I think you bring up a really good point, Nick. Like, I was told something by a CIO once many years ago that that had a lasting impact on me and that I said, hey, mister CIO, you buy a lot of things. You must get sick of people like me coming and knocking on your door. Something I would never say at a later stage in my career, but he gave a great answer. He said, yeah. I do get sick of of the salespeople that don't put in the effort and time to bring me value or knowledge. But you gotta realize, like, I don't have that many people in my business that are compensated to investigate and solve complex problems in my business the way that the people trying to sell to me are. So some of the best ideas I've ever received, some of the best knowledge I've ever received is from salespeople because they're incented to do so. They're incented to investigate. And I think some of the best sellers I've ever seen have figured out a way to sort of get as wide and deep within a large company as possible and really tell a story about the different opportunities that could be solved with their product if deployed and sponsored by a central entity like a CIO. Right? So I think that the more data you can provide and the more value you can provide, probably, the more leverage you would then have in justifying a higher price point because you're solving more problems. Right? You're you're solving a bigger, more expensive problem with the the more BUs that are on board with the solution. One of the things that I was first taught as a salesperson is, like, I gotta dig into the pain. I gotta dig into the pain. And that has led me to bias in my initial interactions with prospects around the technical qualification side of things. What's the problem that they have, and can we indeed solve it? Because I feel like the more they talk about the problem and the more I talk about how we can help them solve that problem, the better chance I have of getting a deal done. But it sounds to me like in your initial interactions, you're saying, hey. Let's set the problem aside for a second and instead talk about the stakeholders and how you guys actually buy something like this. Am I right? And so, like, if I am, can you talk about really what that first interaction really looks like? Like, what are you saying? What are you trying to understand immediately? Yeah. I I don't think the how should replace the why. It should be the how in addition to the why. Right? So I think identifying pain is always gonna be important. Right? If you're selling a baseball mitt to a figure skater, then you probably haven't identified that or qualified them accurately. Right? So there's still that. But I I just think that, ultimately, understanding landscape and and who else would need to be qualified and influenced in addition to that person to justify how big of a problem or the why is really what I'm I'm just trying to instill is is super valuable, especially when you're selling upmarket. What are the other things about enterprise sales that, like, reps just totally screw up? Or, like, where are the places where mid market reps going into enterprise struggle a lot? That is honestly my question is, like, where do you see the mid market reps not able to hang when it comes to the bigger deal game? Yeah. I've seen deals be lost or I've seen deals be delayed because there was fear or there wasn't, in most cases, hard work put into becoming multithreaded, either yourself or by selling with other executives. Right? If you get your hand slapped, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're you're doing a bad job. It means you just decided that you were gonna take your own success into your own hands. Now easier said than done when you're a manager and you haven't built that personal relationship with that person. You haven't gone out and had coffee or beer with that person, and you, you know, I don't know their kids' names. You might know them. And that's when it just becomes important to not sell alone. Right? This is when early in the cycle, there's these big executive meetings. It doesn't have to be your manager. It can be an executive sponsor, but you need to align those people so that when there's fifteen days left in the fiscal year and your champion says, it's looking good. It's looking good. And you're go tell your boss and says, Pete told me it's looking good. They're gonna freak out because they're gonna say, does this need to go to the board? What's the deal flow and the signing flow? Does it need to go to CFO first? Right? Have they gone through their budget exercise? What is their signing process like? Who signs this? Right? And unless you have the best champion in the world who knows how sales works and gives you all that information, you are still just relying on a middleman and you don't have the ability to go influence something. And I've seen many, many times everything was perfectly aligned, but someone went on a ski trip and the deal couldn't get signed. And it was because there was no access to that CFO. Your champion was scared to contact that person. And about six months ago, you remembered the QBR when your head of product came in and those two people talked about their kids going to the same school or had a relationship and executive level and you never aligned those people to then ask for a favor to get that deal signed. Right? And so get multi threaded and, you know, break class early. Right? Because if you haven't, it's gonna be really difficult for you to do hard things to close deals on your timeline, not the customers. Because at the end of the day, customer can still sign on January 1. They'll still get the product. You'll probably still have to give them a price, right, that you offered them. Don't let that happen. So get multithread. So, Dan, what's the best way to go about this exec to exec motion if I'm getting blocked at power? I think it needs to come it's not gonna be that successful if your exec is some email with a VP and they reach out and they've never met before. Right? Like, even as a sales leader, I look for examples and opportunities really early to build a relationship with someone a step level above or more empowered than the champion that has built a really tight relationship with the sales rep. And if your sales leaders aren't helping you do that, aren't selling with you so that they can play that that role, and either it's a good guy, many times it's the bad guy, right, then they're not doing their job as a sales leader. Right? So get your leadership involved. And then certainly look at if your company doesn't have a a methodology around executive sponsorship, which on the large deals, people from every single aspect of your company probably even in your circumstance, Nick, like, I bet one of your legal counterparts would want to speak to the GC of your company and understand how they make decisions. Right? Your GC should be on quota. Right? This is much as a selling person as a officer of the company. Right? So I think getting the culture of your company aligned with with being multithread and creating executive alignments is step one, and then you gotta work hard to create those relationships. Really hard in the COVID world. Right? It'd be a lot easier if we could all break bread and do in person QBRs and and stuff like that. But, this is the world we work in, and it's possible virtually. I think the world has shown that we can we can figure out a way to live in a digital world. Dan, this has been a phenomenal one. I always know it's a good episode when I take four pages of notes. So we gotta move to our final question, and our final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really good things that salespeople should be doing, but we need to flip that on its head. And the final question is, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to stop doing and break because it hurts them more than it helps? I'm not sure everyone's gonna agree with this comment because I'm admittedly a little bit of a a pessimist. I'm working on becoming less of a pessimist and optimists are better, right, than pessimists, so don't get me wrong here. But I think people trust too much. I think, people need to remind themselves that sometime the buyer is the liar. Right? And they have every reason in the world to lie to you. And you gotta be aware, and you have to really break through to get the leverage that you need to be successful. And so sure every person on the podcast or listeners thought about a situation where customer said or you told your manager, hey. The customer told me this. Right? And maybe they were just misinformed, but maybe they misled you. Certainly, procurement's job is to do that. Maybe we do it a little bit as well. But if you fully trust everything you hear, you're probably getting misled. Beautiful. Dan, is there anything that you want to promote before we end the interview here? No. Sales is the best job in the world. We're so lucky to be able to have binary results. I know being on quota is tough, but I can't imagine not being able to wake up every day and have a clear goal to hit or directly influence my income and, the well-being of my family. So kudos to all your listeners for carrying a bag. Beautiful. Dan, thank you so much for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Dan Cutler include number one, there are three criteria before you give pricing. Number one, do you have technical validation? Two, do you have budget? And then three, do you have power? Number two, whenever you're stuck below the line, do not be afraid to go exec to exec. Work that network early on. Get your execs to sell alongside you. Number three, before you jump into that room or before you start talking at a CIO or a CXO, you should probably just ask them why the heck we're in the room together. And then lastly, number four, you can get caught up in the clicks. You can get caught up in the technical processes, but if you are not aligned to an initiative or a compelling event that is about making money or saving money, then you're just hoping that your deal gets done. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here? Let's talk about making money, Armond. Did you know you might not have known Armond, but the esteemed listener knows that we have sponsors of this show. And when we bring sponsors on, what we refuse to do is just say some lame feature dump ad, and we refuse to only do ads with our sponsors. Arman and I have created very special exclusive playbook episodes with all of our sponsors that you can only access at the link in the show notes. So our sponsors like when you go watch them, hint hint wink wink. Check them out if you want more thirty minutes to presidents club content, and we will see you next week on the show.
