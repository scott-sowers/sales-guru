## Transcript

Good morning, everybody. And welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Froeck, and I'm here with my cohost, Marc Casaglow. Holy smokes. Was this a good one? If you are trying to figure out how to run your week, this one is for you. It is Jordan Chavez, regional director of sales over at Navaan. Mark, why should people listen? You know, every once in a while, we interview somebody, Arman, that I would wanna work for. Jordan is the dude I'd work for. So if you wanna hear, like, the type of leadership or frontline leader that I wanna work for as a rep, like, this is the episode. Alrighty, Jordan. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Awesome. Starting number one, time management. Breaking that down by income or equity. Income, activities that are gonna pay off in the next one to six months. Equity is really defined as activities that are gonna pay off the next six plus months. Now for an account executive, these are gonna be different than a sales leader. A sales leader, you're really gonna wanna focus an audit of your calendar. I typically do that once a month. Do a look back of where did I spend my time. If it's outside of the framework of about 70% income, 30% equity time, I know I need to readjust and really recalibrate for the future months. Now income time is really defined by things that are related to deal execution, forecasting, qualification, rep one on ones. Equity time, lot more focused on things like outbound prospecting, personal development, and skip levels. Boom. Amazing. What's number two? Number two, skill will matrix as a way to really robustly assess talent. On the x axis, you have will, and on the y axis, you have skill. So y axis specifically is skill related to the role that they are in. X axis is will in the form of drive and motivation, how they take your coaching, how quickly reps implement. On the bottom left, you've got quadrant one, which is low skill and low will. Really need to focus here and make a quick decision on whether we try to uplevel these reps, move them into the quadrant three, which is the bottom right, or potentially exit the organization. Quadrant two is top left. These are gonna be the ones that you're gonna wanna spend the most amount of attention on in the sense that you are seeing them as high skill, but low will. Thus, they can be looked at as people who are looked up to an organization by your reps, but ultimately could be toxic to the business and to what you're trying to achieve. Quadrant three, bottom right. These are where a majority of reps will start. You're low skill, but you're very high on will. You're very motivated to learn. You're very interested in developing, doing everything a 110%, but you just don't have the skill set developed to be successful in the role quite yet. Quadrant four, top right. This is where you want all your reps to get to. This is high skill and high will. You've got your pacesetters, the people that are best in breed at what they are doing. And, likely, you're gonna wanna keep them motivated, keep them challenged to move into the next role, and b, the people who are carrying the team month over month. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by ElevenX, x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Boom. Alright. Bring it home. Three. Three. Weekly role plays. This can be in the framework of either discovery or demonstrations. Ultimately, we wanna do this in a popcorn type scenario. So step number one, send a prompt on Monday. Let them know if it's gonna be discovery, demonstrations, have them prepare with a live example of an upcoming call that they are going to have. Make sure that they are sending you that prep by end of day Tuesday. If we're gonna hold this on a Wednesday, which I typically do, this is gonna be time dependent. So you'll ideally wanna pick two reps, hold them to fifteen minutes each. Everyone is gonna be prepared to do the role play, but you're only gonna select two. You're gonna give them fifteen minutes each for that role play. You're gonna do five to ten minutes of debrief, and we're gonna go around the horn. So every rep in that call is going to say one thing that they thought they did well, two areas that they can improve upon, and continue on, and repeat until it's finished. Alright, Jordan. I have to say one of the most succinct three things that we've had in a long time here. So I wanna dive into this income versus equity idea. I think really what we're saying is is income is like now stuff, typically urgent. Equity is like future stuff, typically important. And that conflict between urgent and important, it you have to master it as a sales leader. So tell me a little bit about how do you navigate determining how much time you wanna put toward urgent versus important, and then how you actually make those decisions, which are really tough in the moment. You're right. It is really challenging, I would say. One of the things that as I was starting off as a sales leader on was just not having a good understanding of how to think about the time that I was spending. Right? I wanted to be very open with my time for my reps to be able to give them everything that they needed, but ultimately not being able to really, like, assess in the moment, should I be spending my time in this way now? So I think the income versus equity is a really nice way to bucket where, like you said, urgent versus important. And I would say as a sales leader, you wanna really focus more on the urgent pieces. Right? There are obviously important long term payoffs that you would want to devote time to and invest in. Right? Hence, equity. Those things could be, you know, outbound prospecting, building a really robust territory plan. You know, those things could pay off near term. But if you're running a an enterprise sales motion, right, those are going to probably pay off in nine, twelve, eighteen months. Right? So laying that foundation is key. Like, we all want those real time instant gratification and instant feedback. Right? So you still wanna feed the beast in driving things and doing things that are going to pay off to you near term, especially because at the end of the day, we all have quotas to fulfill. Right? We all have to hit our numbers. We all have to get deals closed. And so for me, when I'm looking at this, I try to do so weekly, but I also coach my reps up on doing so in the nature of where they are in their development. I have three account executives who just moved from the SDR org. They are really focused on learning and growing. And a lot of our time is actually gonna be more equity time. Right? Because we're not running deals or managing those on day one. Right? We're gonna be outbound prospecting. We're gonna be developing on how to just do discovery, do demonstrations, manage your forecast. And so there are a lot of activities that as you start to get your feet under you as an account executive, you'll wanna really maybe dial back the equity piece and dial up the income piece. So, yeah, I think it's been something for me that has been incredibly useful in my development as a leader at Novon. What is it called when you go to church? It's called confession, right, where you sit with the priest. So I don't know if we need some theme music for this, Armand, but it's Kasigal confession time. Jordan is my holy leader that's gonna help me figure out my penance. I'm horrible at urgent versus important, dude. I am so bad at it. I will jump on a call with a rep, respond to a Slack, get into an email, jump on a customer call. I'll go, you know, oh, you need to jump on a a huddle real quick in Slack and figure this out. No problem. But it does create an internal conflict. Like, how would you coach me? Like, how would you take someone like me and help me to make better urgent versus important decisions? Well, Mark, I feel the same. So is very much so, you know, and I think most leaders or people who become sales leaders have this innately. Right? They want to be helpful. They want to see other people be successful, and they wanna scale their influence to people and help them develop their careers. So I don't think it's inherently a bad thing. And the internal conflict lets me know that you think about it and you consider it and you are really focused on, okay. Is this the right thing to do? My gut reaction tells me I wanna be helpful. It doesn't help that we have a lot of these productivity tools that we have kind of all twenty four seven access given to our reps or our leaders, like our DPs and CROs. Slack. It's very challenging to not instantly try to respond to a Slack. It's very challenging not to try and instantly respond to the urgent customer, you know, email that gets sent that is, a frustrated client or a frustrated prospect. To look back over the last, let's say, one to two months of your calendar, I think you'll be surprised at where you actually spend your time versus where you intend to spend your time. Where did you actually spend your time? Looking back on it, where did you believe or you do intend to spend your time? And And if there's a disconnect, which there often is, we can talk about certain strategies to actually get you to, you know, in the moment, not have to respond to everything urgently. One good way to do that, it's very simple. Right? If someone asks you for something, if a rep asks you for something, I always ask, where did you go to find this information before coming to me? So it gets them to think about, oh, am I just coming to Jordan because he's my manager and he's easy to access and he always gives me an answer? Or do I need to figure out how to get this from someone else in the organization or maybe directly from the source? Even so, asking a cross functional leader, hey. When does this actually need to be delivered by? Do you expect me to get this done for you today, or is this something that can be put off until the end of the week, end of the month? Right? And it also helps you understand what is the level of urgency that I'm actually being asked about from that side. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. So let's go and take this a step further where, Jordan, you've talked about this concept of the urgent versus the important work or the income versus the equity activities. You mentioned that it's important to have, call it, 70% income, 30% equity. Could you talk through what does a week look like for you as a leader? So if you just take an example week, what would be examples of your income activities and when those would happen? And then what would be examples of your equity activities, and where would those happen? So I try to create a pretty consistent operating cadence. It sets good expectations for the reps on my team of what to expect from me, but it also just makes it easier for me to not have to make that conscious decision of what I'm gonna do on a specific day. So for me, that's really broken down. I I think of Mondays as my more equity days. So those are days where I'm having internal one on ones. We're talking through personal development with all of my reps. We do have a team meeting that's set on Mondays so that we can set the standard and set the stage for the week and what we're going to accomplish. So it is a mix of equity and income, but I'd say heavy on the equity so that I can get that done through the week. Mondays, I'm not always the most, let's say, attentive. Right? So I wanna be able to ease into the week. Tuesdays are days that are really focused on at Novant, and for me and my team in particular, solely focused on outbound prospecting. Wednesdays and Thursdays are really focused on income days. So it's all about doing deal qualification through medpicks, setting a deal review with any individual rep or deal on the team. This is where my reps will devote most of their time to external calls, discovery calls, demos, late stage calls. And then Friday is where we start to wrap it all up where I am focused on looking back at the week, what did we accomplish, where did we actually meet what we were expecting from a prospecting perspective, from a deal progression perspective, and then ultimately get the forecast tight so that I can deliver that in the following week. So I would say early in the week, I try to focus more on those bigger items that I can sit down and think more about. Midweek, I'm really in the minutia of deals and deal execution and, working with my reps kinda one on one to get those things aligned. And finish the week, the goal is to really get that all summarized in my mind so that I can look forward and make any edits as needed. Let's start on Monday. Those are your equity days, one on ones, and team meetings. Talk to me about what does an equity day one on one look like versus a pipeline review? One on ones are challenging because, inevitably, reps will want to come and bring what's most recent, what is most top of mind, right, which is typically deals. It is typically any challenges or any excitement about how deals are progressing. And so it's very easy to say, let's just make this a deal review. And so you wanna really avoid that, and it's a challenge. I think the biggest way that I try to ensure that the one on one days are focused on what activities they were doing. Right? So we're even looking back at their own breakdown of income versus equity from the week prior. We're also focused on where they have kind of these big levers they need to pull in the sense of development. So that could be a topic of champion building. It could be a topic of executing a go no go. We might even set role plays and do those one on one in that meeting. And then we'll really focus, and what I like to spend time on is obviously making the one on one about the rep. Right? It's their time. It's not my time. Right? So it's their, incentive to bring what is most relevant to them, but I also need to make sure that we're not getting pulled down to the minutia of specific deals. So, really, what I like to talk through with you know, if it does become deal focused is more high level goals. Okay. Let's break this out on a quarterly basis or a half basis depending on my quota. What do you wanna achieve this quarter? Great. Then we know, do we need to drive more pipeline because your pipeline coverage is low, or you need to really focus on deal execution because you have a ton of deals that are all sitting in a similar stage, and how do we prioritize those? So that's really where the equity piece comes in, where a lot of reps wanna pull into the income piece. I've heard so many sales leaders talk about the one on one is the rep's time, and it's their responsibility to bring stuff. I can count on one hand the number of reps that came to a one on one with something meaningful to talk about. I understand it conceptually. I just think in reality, it doesn't work. I think expectations are the most important part of it. Right? So if we agree on expectations and we agree that this is what we should be spending the time on, If that doesn't happen the first time, that's fine. I'm going to take that on the chin, and I'll say, hey. This is my fault. I didn't set clear expectations of you and what I'm expecting for this conversation, for this call. We can keep the time. We could talk about what you've prepared, if at anything, or we can cancel. But after that first time, I'm no longer going to accept that you didn't have things prepared to talk about, and we're just not gonna use the time. Right? There are give and gets. I will always come with things that I wanna talk about. Right? But I wanna make sure that the rep is thinking about themselves and auditing themselves consistently and think about what they need and what they want. So that's not just me, old man, yelling at cloud every single day or every single week trying to convince you that these are things that you should care about. I think one of the hard lessons that I had to learn as a manager is I can't want this for you. You have to actually do it. You have to want it. And so I can give you the tools. I can set the expectations. We can keep each other mutually accountable. But if you don't want it, then, frankly, I don't have time, and I don't want to invest my own time in that. To me, you always separate out your deal review, pipeline review, whatever, and your one on one. And when you do that, you can be really specific on what the purpose of each one is. Like, for my deal review, I want people to make sure that their data is correct in the CRM. I wanna make sure that they leave with a list of things to go do on every single deal, and I wanna make sure that I'm influencing the neural pathways with which they're thinking about moving deals to the pipeline. Like, that's my purpose in a deal review. In a one on one, I have one purpose. I just want to become friends. Like, I want relationship. I could care less if they brought anything to talk about. I was just gonna talk with them for thirty minutes just like a human. Like, we were just gotta be there after work and just we're, like, shooting the shit. And I found, like, one on one sometimes, we try to create this whole thing. Well, it's gotta be about personal development, and they need to walk away with, like, action steps, and they need to do this. Armand, I don't know if you've seen something similar, but, like, I could care less if they come to something to talk about with the one on one. I just wanna talk and build relationship. I hate to be the Switzerland here, but I'm a little bit of a neutral party in this one where I would oftentimes call them the fifty fifty one on ones where I wanna do 50% just, like, check-in and on the human being, but then I'd like to spend the other 50% doing some sort of skill building, professional development, etcetera. Because to your point, that's not gonna happen in the pipeline review. Let's talk about Tuesdays. Jordan, you mentioned these are outbound Tuesdays. So you have DialBlitz, call blocks, etcetera. What does that look like for you as a manager? I assume you're not just wearing your pom poms on that day and running around the the floor and cheering people on for their dials. How are you participating? There's usually two ways. One is I do often get in the boat with my reps. So I will try to say, hey. If you've done your prep, you know who you wanna target. You're looking at right contact, right person or sorry. Right account, right contact, right time, all that. Send me the top 10 CFOs that you wanna have a conversation with, and I will dial them. Obviously, give me your hypothesis about why this is a good account, why they should look into Novant, the value prop based on what you've seen in the research you've done to help empower me to get that and land that cold call. But, ultimately, I will also do that with the reps and have them send me their top, let's say, 10 CFOs to dial. Now a big part of my job is to really think about what I call the rule of three, right, which is you're always gonna have you should always be thinking about someone on your team is going to get fired, someone is gonna get promoted, and someone is gonna surprise you. So you should always think about how can I keep my candidate funnel active, engaged, and build that top of funnel? Because that's my own outbounding, right, is by recruiting. So what I typically will spend most of my Tuesday on is in LinkedIn recruiter. We'll be building profiles, finding and investigating who I think is a potential good fit, building outreach. I typically focus my outreach, not on InMails because I think InMails end up landing in no man's land. Everyone sees them, assumes it's a recruiter, and deletes them. So what I'll try to do is actually utilize things like ZoomInfo, get their cell phones, send them a text, give them a call. Cold calling an account executive, I think, ultimately sets the standard of what you will expect of them, and I think it really breaks up their idea of what it would look like to come work for me if I do land that call. By the way, Mark, I do agree with you, and I think the change of location is the biggest piece of getting people to open up personally. That's why I go take a walk. Right? Let's get out of the office. Let's go do a walk around. Let's break bread together. So first question would be, what is your recruiting activity number every week? Our recruiting activity number really lands on high personalization. So it's gonna be a little bit lower volume than just blasting out a bunch of InMails or repeatable, you know, follow ups, seeing if they've looked at my, first message. So I try to focus on at minimum 45 touches per week. Now that could be a mixture of InMails, could be a mixture of Direct Connects, likely not InMails, but Direct Connects, calls, texts. And, really, with the focus on personalization, I try to go to the degree of sending a note that includes some things where I'm being assumptive about this person. I'm trying to make a hypothesis of why I think they might be a good fit for me and for this company and for this opportunity. So I will do what I call two observations and a question. So what I'll do is I'll look at the person's profile. I will actually write out a two specific observations. There was a candidate that I reached out to that wrote a lot of their information in their LinkedIn bio, including books that they like to read. And so I assumed that they would like a certain book that I end up recommending to them. The second observation was that they had a lot of other accreditations outside of just their job. They were med pick certified. They were force you know, first management certified. They were black swan certified. And so what I assumed was this is someone who is investing in their own development outside of what they're getting from their leadership team or from their actual company today, and they could potentially be a future CRO or have those types of goals. So I wrote those things down. It almost always hits because people wanna know that you take an interest in them and who they are, and they also love talking about themselves. So even if it's not someone who's actively looking, they will almost inevitably be open to a conversation to at least make a connection. And you're doing that every single week? I try to. Yes. Now the accountability isn't always there. Right? I don't always hit those numbers, but that's really what I aim to do. Yeah. To me, that's you know, sometimes stuff gets in the way. But this is the takeaway is, like, if you want a great team, you build a great team. And you know what? Like, the Boston Celtics didn't just say, you know what? Let's get Drew Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis. In here, they had scouts scouting them for years. You constantly have to be recruiting the best team because you never know when somebody's gonna leave. You never know when somebody's not gonna work out. You never know what you don't know. The best leaders have the best teams, but it's not by accident. And it's not always because they created the best teammates or the best players. They coached them up and hired them too. You know? The last point I'll make on that is I completely agree with you, Mark. The best reps are never going to raise their hand. They're never going to be the ones that say, you know what? I actually think I'm gonna go just send my resume over to Navaan, see if anyone picks it up, and I'll have an opportunity there. Because those reps that you want are usually a players. They're locked in where they are. Right? They're making money. They are happy typically. Right? There may be a few things that they are maybe not fully bought into at the company, but, ultimately, you need to convince them. It's just like outbound prospecting. I need to convince you that you should think differently about this, and here's the opportunity available to you. So you're absolutely right. Though I will challenge, you know, from being from Dallas, we'll see if if Luca and the the best player on the courts can actually pull through. We'll see. Well, listen. I'm Slovenian, so I'm a Luca guy too. So There you go. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. I wanna dig into a little bit your forecasting stuff, Jordan, because forecasting is kinda like this unique thing in every company, honestly. Super specialized, but I think that there's some general principles that most people can learn. So take me through the general forecasting structure at Novant. So today, I'm in a unique position that I am a frontline leader. I do technically roll up directly to our CRO, Grant McGrail. Now we are in a little bit of a different business unit within the broader travel and expense ecosystem of Novant. I specifically lead a team that is focused on our expense management platform and really consider us a tiger team within the broader Navani landscape of the sales work. So on a Friday, what I will do is I sit down with my reps. We're all in a team meeting together. This is the most operational call I ever do on a weekly basis because I am not assessing whether or not we need to strategize specific deals, what we need to do in the deal. I am simply looking at that single plane of glass. Where are we at in this deal? Do we have a champion? Have we verified that they are a champion? Do we know who the economic buyer is? Is the economic buyer aware of this evaluation? Do we have a joint execution plan in place? Do we have a outlined time frame with which we're gonna accomplish those steps? And so that allows me to, in real time, assess, are we committing this deal? In what time frame are we gonna commit that? And what deals are in best case? I don't necessarily need to have a direct roll up of commit number to the deals that roll up to that number. But I do wanna know if it's the August 1, what am I gonna close at the August? Do I have the best case deals to support that commit number if we progress those deals? Right? If we get them to a point where we do have a champion, we do have a verified e b that we're going to have a meeting with, etcetera. It's ensuring that we have the operational piece of knowing where these things are, what actions or gates as we call them internally at Navaan have we passed through in this deal progression to then really justify the commit number. And then I also take a little bit of credence to who this person is, where they are in their development. Do I trust them? Right? Have they committed a high number before, not met it? Have they lowballed and then constantly exceeded that number? Now Mondays are when I actually roll up my forecast with my CRO and my other sales leader peers. So we will all go one by one, rolling up our commit, and do the exact same cadence with our CRO. Now we don't again get into deals. He just wants to know, okay. What deals do you have to support this commit number? Where are they at? And what is maybe that head to pillow stretch target if everything goes well? So that's really how that cadence works. Fridays, I do it with my team, and then on Mondays is when I roll it up to my CRO. Define best case and commit. What what do those mean at Navaan? A commit is what I am committing to the business, which means I'm holding this rep accountable to that number no matter what happens. They should ideally try to come within five to 10% of that number every single time. The best case is really deals that have gone beyond simply just being in pipeline in the sense of we have an idea of the time frame of this evaluation. We maybe have an identified champion. We haven't necessarily tested or validated that they are champion yet. Maybe we need to triangulate who the EB is, the economic buyer. Maybe we still need to work on some negotiations, some legal, whatever that may be. Right? So best case literally means in the best of cases, this deal can close in this month. Now in in that scenario, you could have a deal that is a commit for the following month, but is a best case for this month, which means if I run the table, I can pull that in and and close it in this month. That's really how we define best case versus commit. Do you also have, like, an idea of, like, intra quarter or intra month? Meaning, like, deals that open and close in that period but aren't reflected in your pipeline yet when you're doing forecasting. Do you have a concept to that? Is that your job to track, or does finance provide you that kind of information? That is the tricky part, especially depending on the velocity of your deals. If you're running I both manage commercial deal cycle, so between two hundred and six fifty employees, as well as more of a mid market cycle, which is up to 3,000 employees. So there can be tremendous amount of difference in the cycle time, in the negotiation, legal review, all that. So there is that component. Now in an inter month close, it's not always accounted for. I think what I try to do is it's on me. It's not on finance. It's not on marketing. It's not on sales ops. It's really try to look back and audit where have we gotten any of those deals. What is the source? Is it from an inbound lead flow? Is it from SDR? Is it from AE? Did they get CFO as the original discovery meeting contact? So there's all these components that I look at to see, okay, on average, we're getting maybe two of these, and the average sales price is about, let's say, 50 k. Right? So I can at least make a rough guess that we're going to pull those numbers in in a given month as long as the team is still hitting capacity of what I expect. So it is a little bit of the science, not necessarily the math, associated with forecasting. Just to share what I've seen as best practices, the frontline manager is absolutely responsible for forecasting accurately. It is better to forecast accurately below your number than to try to forecast your number and figure it out and miss. We talked about a lot of habits that managers can exhibit when it comes to running their day. It's It's time to talk about a bad one. So what is one bad habit that every leader should break so that all teams get a little bit better out there? One bad habit all sales leaders should break is to ensure that they are not being apologetic about delivering bad news. Right? Things change. People have to deliver bad news. It is one, do not show your emotion even if it's negative associated with that change because inevitably people will sniff that out. They will know that you're not committed and you're not really bought into that change. So ensure that you may disagree, but you have to disagree and commit and show that that's something that you are standing behind irregardless. Jordan, this was a freaking awesome show. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Alrighty, Mark. It is time for the two by two recap. What do you have for your two? Number one. I had a personal accountability moment of urgent versus important. And this idea of color coding your calendar and, you know, that little left hand side of Google can kinda tell you the breakdown of your day. So super simple. I thought that it was just, you know, just one of these good reminders is I personally get sucked into the urgent a lot. I think a lot of sales leaders do. So that's number one. Make sure you're just you got something in place that can you can audit. Are you choosing important consistently enough? And then secondly is ABR. Always be recruiting. If you want the best sales team, be on LinkedIn contacting one or two people a week and start those conversations now when you don't need them so that when you do need them, you know what number Three. The perfect week for a sales leader. Monday are your equity days with one on ones. Tuesdays are your outbound days. Fridays are your forecast days. Wednesdays and Thursdays are your deal review days rather. And lastly, number four. When you are doing that Tuesday outbound day, you're having your reps send them their top 10 CFOs they wanna go after, and you're doing your 45 outbound recruiting touches that week. Alrighty, folks. If you liked this one, we have been doing a ton of leadership content on the newsletter. And most recently, we ran a newsletter on how to self source your pipeline as an account executive. So if you are a leader trying to teach your ups how to manage their book of closing and their prospecting, you got some tips from this episode. If you want a written version of that, you can have something that is a similar flavor to that in the show notes. Alrighty, folks. We will catch you soon.
