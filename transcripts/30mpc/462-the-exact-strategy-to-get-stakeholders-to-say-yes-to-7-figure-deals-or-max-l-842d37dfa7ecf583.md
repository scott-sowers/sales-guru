## Transcript

Wow. You guys are that expensive? Like, we're not expecting to spend that much. Instead of trying to start negotiating there or talking about how you can discount, say, it sounds like price is your number one priority. That person is either gonna agree or they're gonna give you a few other things that are as important or not more important than price. So I think salespeople often suffer from, like, not actually thinking about, like, what does it take to implement this? Like, you're like, oh, you just go plug it in. It's like, no. John owns Salesforce. It's gonna take him two hours. That team that owns Snowflake, it's ten hours of table work for them over two weeks. And really what you're doing here is, like, you're doing your homework and you're doing their homework for them. Now I have this plan in front of you with every integration. I've sussed out who the owner is of all those integrations. How does that resonate with you VP of IT? Is this enough? Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes of president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my coast, Nick Szygalski. Oh, man. If you want to learn how to sell complex enterprise deals and derisk every single technical blocker and business blocker you could possibly imagine to close a 6 or 7 figure deal. This is the one. It is with Max Licht. He was previously the number one SDR over at Zuora. Then he was the number one AE all time by ACV and TCV at Productive. And in his first year, has put up some monstrous numbers over at Maestro QA as an enterprise AE. Nick, why should people listen? IT stakeholders in any deal are typically a double edged sword. They're either going to accelerate your deal and help you get this thing brought through, or they're gonna totally torpedo it. And Max is an expert at winning over those IT stakeholders, and he takes us through his process for what he calls shadowing both the technical and business process that IT basically has to support as a mechanism to help you completely blow the competition and the current state out of the water and know exactly what your team needs to demo and sell to. And then he also takes us through, like, some of the most common objections or places of resistance that he gets from IT stakeholders and how he actually overcomes those objections. So if you sell anything where IT is even remotely associated with that deal, Max is somebody who will help you make more money. I promise. Alright, Max. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Takeaway number one, pointed observation open ended question. This is the practice of preparing pointed observations that aligned your differentiators and having prepared open ended questions that position people's attention toward that differentiator. These observations can be things like customer narratives or observations that you have broadly about the market from having so many conversations. This could sound something like, hey. I'm talking to a lot of chief risk officers who obviously have insight into front office risk, but it actually turns out that most of the risk in their quality process is in the back office element of that process. Square, Coinbase, Affirm, over 50% of the things that they are doing in their quality process is back office. How are you thinking about the back office as part of the quality initiative that you're driving at Acme, Kill? Really nice. What's number two? Shadow based discovery and business cases. Shadows are watching your customers' workflows or actually putting eyes on the systems and the manual processes that drive their current state. We're gonna build the concept of shadowing into every part of our discovery and business case process in order to gain alignment with the buyer and alignment on our sales process. What this might sound like in discovery is a prospect will go, hey. You know, it's really important that we integrate with Snowflake and really replicate this kind of reporting we have in our current system. Instead of trying to solve that on the call there, we're gonna say, okay. That sounds great. We have strong confidence we're able to do something like that, but we'd like to scope that current process in the underlying system before making any promises for a business case in order to derisk implementation. I'm gonna build that scoping and a couple of suggested scoping steps into our mutual evaluation plan that I'll share after this. But how does kinda working in some scoping into this evaluation process resonate with the process that you're looking to drive? Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Alright, Max. We're in this hour. What's number three? It sounds like price is your number one priority. This is a response when, especially, an executive or a procurement person or really anyone who is over focusing on price continues to bring up your price and how expensive you are. So this might sound something like, wow. You guys are that expensive. Like, we were not expecting to spend that much. Instead of trying to start negotiating there or talking about how you can discount, say, it sounds like price is your number one priority. That person is either gonna agree and say, yep, price is all that matters. And then in that case, like, this might be a disqualification, or they're gonna give you a few other things that are as important or not more important than price. They'll say, actually, handle time reduction and really creating a automated fraud ops process is is just as important, if not more important than price. You might respond and say something like, that sounds great. Handle time reduction and building fraud ops quality processes are core to our value, and it sounds like we need to compare that against the price in order to justify this expenditure. So, Max, let's dig in on this second takeaway. So in the prep, you mentioned a tactic that I've never heard. You called it shadow based discovery. What would an example of, like, shadow based discovery be or a use of shadowing in a sales cycle be like? There's two, I would say, basic elements or most common elements of the shadowing that you're gonna do. The first is shadowing the painful manual business process that you are likely replacing. That painful manual business process for me, I saw, like, quality assurance tool. So, honestly, that process from start to finish of how they select a case, grade a case, report on it. Basically, there are people who end to end own this process of quality within the organization. I know because I'm well researched on the current state that they're using some combination of Excel, Salesforce, all these different tools. They're swivel sharing. And what I wanna do is see that process so I can essentially drag them through the glass and see where the blood is really being drawn in that process. I like to say that a shadow says a million words. Mhmm. So as you're going through that shadow process, you're gonna see a bunch of places in that workflow where there's inefficiency. There's gonna be places where your tool differentiates especially that you see within that workflow, and that's really what you wanna drive from that business shadow. Now how this might manifest itself, for instance, in, like, a discovery conversation. Someone's gonna say, you know, we have this really manual process today. I don't know if it's possible to replace. We have this really complex reporting. Do you guys think that's something that you can augment or that you can replace? And your instinct might be to say, hey. Like, we are the best at reporting. Like, we will crush that. A better response might be, look. We're pretty confident. Like, those are the kind of problems that we solve for. But before making any promises, we'd like to much better understand that current state of that reporting and that workflow. Can we build a shadow of your current manual reporting process into our evaluation criteria? That way, we are able to speak specifically to that reporting and also tell you what we can't do, and we will be transparent about that. Let's actually walk through a shadowing meeting. How do you actually run that meeting without just, like, sitting over their shoulder and asking them to click on a million different things? If you've prefaced the shadow correctly and you're building champions and driving excitement, they're actually gonna be excited to shadow for you because they have this sense that Max knows how to build a business case. Max is gonna save me from this manual process I'm in. And if I can show him really where this is painful, he's gonna be a great partner on this business case to bring this up. So I think the way that we bring this ethos of shadowing, you know, in sales, you always wanna give a reason of why. So as you're going into the shadow process, you're constantly selling, like, oh, the shadow's gonna be great for that because we're gonna be able to articulate how much time this takes you in the current state. I'm gonna take some screenshots, and when we go up to your boss, we're gonna be able to really articulate the painful aspect of x y z thing that we're replacing. So I think for one, like, really, at the end of the day, you are watching them click through their workflow. You're kinda watching the pain of what they do every day, but if you're selling how it aligns to the business case, you're selling how it's derisking implementation, they're really gonna be encouraged to do that, and they're gonna understand where it's going. So I think another big aspect of this, like, champion building is such a massive aspect of the shadowing piece, because by the time we're going into these shadows, if they're willing to do it, if they're kinda gung ho about it, it means we're forming champions who trust that we're going to solve a problem, and they see this shadow as a means of solving that problem. Leading into it, like, a, you wanna be very clear about what information you wanna problem. Leading into it, like, a, you wanna be very clear about what information you wanna extract from that. So, like, hey. You know, Nick, I wanna shatter your QA workflow. What that usually looks like is the selection process, the filtering process, the assignment process, the grading process, then how that filters into reporting, and then how you go from that reporting, and then you go communicate to your executives. So usually, it's about five to six things that we wanna shadow. Let me know if you have any questions, but guessing that's something that's kinda central to you. So you're really defining what that shadow process looks like. By the time they hop on, they should be very aware about what aspects of the workflow they're shadowing. You should be very innately aware of where your specific differentiators apply to each part of that process. If I'm shadowing this selection process, what are the two to three things that my technology does in that selection process that are really going to differentiate it? And then I'm looking for that and I'm calling it out. Can you show me that field again? Oh, that field's gonna be really important. If your competitor's not talking about extracting that field, let's make sure to button that away for later and make sure we talk about those really tactical things. Is that you're gonna gain this intimate understanding of what the current state looks like Uh-huh. And you're gonna get some shadow of your competitors a lot. I know what all my competitors look like because I asked to shadow them. And then when someone goes, how do you know that about my competitor? Oh, I shadowed them four times last month and replaced them for three. So this is all coming from a place of deep research that's also a benefit of that shadow process. You know, Max, I wasn't as intentional about you as doing this when I sold ERP software to law firms, but I remember, like, there were a couple times we ended up, I guess, stumbling into doing a shadow, and it totally changed the dynamic of the deal. I remember we had this one law firm. It's a really large law firm in San Francisco. And the managing partner of the firm, he was like, we have a super complex calculation methodology to determine how much we pay the partners of our law firm. And he goes, it literally takes our CFO an entire quarter to do those calculations. One thing that you called out in the way that you were selling the shadow that I think is really important for folks to know, you were like, we're gonna let you know where we can help, but we're also gonna call out, like, where we can't so that we'll let you know where there are gaps in the process. And I think that's really important because a lot of folks, when they're thinking about making a change, are really, really scared of certain places being a step back. And when you use that as a reason to say, hey. We're gonna tell you where we're great and where we actually can't help, It actually reduces a lot of their anxiety. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Let's say I'm listening to this, and I'm like, hell, yeah. This is something that I wanna integrate into my sales process. First question for you is, what are some of the other areas where there are opportunities for a shadow? If there isn't a set of manual painful processes or, like, some current state to observe, it means they're probably not trying to solve the problem. So, also, like, something to shadow is a sign that they have tried that that there's intent to solve that problem. And in the intent of how they're trying to solve that is so much data about what they're actually trying to do. So that's one thing is there's gonna be a lot of business workflows. Now, underpinning that, there's some set of systems. So many tools today are built on Snowflake or Salesforce. And you might be watching some sort of, like, report. You're watching some Tableau dashboard, but that's, like, sitting on top of Snowflake, and someone owns that Snowflake who is, like, sitting in front of those tables and is, like, screw you, sales guy. I'm not gonna give you the time of day to give you those tables. So you're gonna, like, get the business all fired up. You're gonna do all this business discovery, then you're gonna get to that, you know, VP of data and integrations who owns Snowflake. You'll be, like, oh, all these things you talk about the business, we're not sharing those tables anyway. So, like, it's all a moot point. So as you're talking to the business, is this what you wanna share with them? It's, like, look. Share your experience. Kind of a pointed observation open ended question. A lot of the time, I do all this great business discovery with my business stakeholders, and then we get to the Snowflake owner after three months of hard work, and he takes it all over it. What I would like to do is work with you to unlock a shadow with that technical stakeholder so we can actually align on your use case with the person who's gonna be making that integration. So long winded way of saying, you wanna do those business shadows, but then those are gonna unlock the systems underpinning that because there's huge gatekeepers underneath those processes that are going to kill you in the last mile of the deal, and you wanna use these technical shadows to get in front of them. And not just yourself, like, bring the superstars on your team. I'm bringing my CTO, MIT grad, engineer extraordinaire to go nerd out with them. Like, you're not just multi threading with their organization. You're also multi threading with their organization. So when I'm doing that Snowflake shadow technically that I earned through my business stakeholder, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna bring my CTO in. Dude's a whiz. He can go toe to toe with you about Snowflake. They're gonna leave that call grudgingly like, well, those guys didn't know what they were talking about, and that is kinda compelling that they would pull that in. You step into that meeting. It's them, their technical goons, you and your chief technical goon. How do you make sure that meeting stays on the rails? If you have earned the right to get in front of this, like, VP of data and their Salesforce goons and their snowflake goons, this is a huge tactical opportunity in the deal, and you need to be ready to sing the tune really tightly. So for one, you should be doing a couple dry runs with your CTO, telling him where not to go, telling him where you're gonna interrupt. If it's, like, slides and then they're sharing, and then it's back to, like, wrapping the conversation. I think you always wanna tease people up and be like, look. I'm gonna open it up. I'm gonna ask these open ended questions. Put it back on them to describe the roles in the call. As soon as they start sharing screen, you know, mister CTO, your show, we really wanted to check out these couple tables, but, obviously, you know what you're talking about. As soon as you feel like we're getting toward the end of that, just flip it back to me, and I'm gonna uncover some concerns from them and really ask for the next steps with the business after we kinda have we checked this technical checkbox. So it sounds like if I think about that meeting as a sandwich, they're owning the middle part of the sandwich, the meat, the cheese, the lettuce, tomato. You're owning the bread, the kickoff of the call, and then the wrap of the call. Can you voice over for me what the kickoff of that call actually sounds like? It sounds like you're sharing some slides. It sounds like you're teeing up some questions, but I think it would be helpful for folks to hear how you, like, set the agenda and set the tone for those meetings. So, like, the first most important thing is that you reference the situation, your champions, the problem they're solving, the work you've done to get here, why this person specifically is involved. So that might sound something like, hey. You know, I've been working with John and team over here a lot. We're really excited about our opportunity to automate the quality process end to end. Leading in this, we've done a lot of business scoping of the processes that we've seen in between Salesforce and Excel and Tableau and Snowflake, and we see a ton of opportunity for optimization. But in these situations, we know how important it is to derisk implementation. The Snowflake integration is a big piece of this. So that's why I wanted to bring you guys in early on so we can be transparent about what data we think we're able to pull, the level of effort in getting this data, and really anything that we're not able to cover as part of this. And then I think a really important thing to share is the outcome of this call. Look. Coming out of this call, what we would like to do is create an implementation plan and a level of effort that specifically scopes the IT headcount or the technical headcount that you're going to need to implement this. Because what all these IT people are worried about is you're gonna ask me to come plug into Snow Place. It's gonna be a shit show. It's gonna take thirty hours. And these sales guys, they never talk about it during, you know, the presale. We sign a contract. We get pulled into implementation. It's this entire shit show. And you wanna tell this narrative of, I wanna solve these problems, but it's not just business problems. There's technical problems that you own as well. We are doing this in order to tightly scope the level of effort, and the word you'll always hear is derisk derisk derisk. We know what we need to pull. We know how much headcount going it's going to take. It's not gonna be derailed unless you guys delay things. So I think kicking things off, it's summarizing, emphasizing the the pain you're solving for your champion, telling those people why they've become involved very tactically, and then talking about a deliverable. It's gonna be a very tightly stoped level of effort that we're gonna present to you with our champion as part of the business A lot of times people will say, that's good sales advice, but it won't work for me. And that actually happens in software sales. People will see a normal demo, and they'll be like, I could see how this software could solve a problem for someone, but my situation is its own unique snowflake. And so you lose the deal because they don't believe it works for them. And so then you walk them through the business shadowing, and they're like, okay. I could see how this could work for my business, but I don't know if this is gonna work for, like, my tech stack. And then you knock that one off with a technical shadow. And then the technical team's like, you know, this could work technically, but to actually get this thing to work, it's gonna take I I don't believe it. It's just gonna take me seventeen years and 14 team members that I don't even have, and that's the next blocker that pops into their mind. And so all you're doing is you're just taking these objections one by one, and you're lining up a sales process or a buyer experience that allows them to see for themselves that it is in fact going to work for their business one by one. To that point, one of the things that you talked about is, like, getting to the end of this and helping give them an estimate of the resources that are needed on their end. My guess is based on the complexity of your sale, this is not the only interaction you're having with this prospect where you're helping them estimate or quantify, like, resources needed on their end beyond just the money they would have to spend on something. So my question for you is, like, one, like, how are you quantifying or estimating? Is it, like, person hours? Is it number of people over months? How do you, like, quantify or estimate? And then two, where are you sharing that information? Does it just get sent sent in an email? You referenced, like, a mutual evaluation tool. I'm hoping to understand how you'd socialize and build consensus with the multiple stakeholders that you're working with. Shadows, technical calls, like, all these things are a give. Like, they're giving you time. They're giving you information. They're showing you things. And there's this really, like, natural give get motion that, like, you need to be a part of. So when they give that, they wanna get something, and they wanna get specificity. They wanna get deliverables. They wanna get shareable content. So always think, like, if they're giving me a shadow, if they're giving me access to their VP of IT, their VP of data, what are they getting from that? So if you're giving me a business shadow, you're gonna get a really specific plan for how we can implement that business process and also the ROI of, like, that move from a to b. If you're giving me access to your Snowflake team and your Salesforce team and those folks who are gonna be running the implementation, I'm going to give you a level of effort. What a level of effort will really look like is pretty much for any software implementation, there's probably three to 10 integrations based upon what you're selling. It's different software you're integrating with is really what it all comes down to. There's typically an owner of each one of those tools. It could be the same person, but if you're talking, hey. Salesforce, Talkdesk, Snowflake, Retool, there's probably one to five people or a different person for each of those that actually owns that and is, like, giving time out of their day to go plug that thing in. So I think salespeople often suffer from, from, like, not actually thinking about, like, what does it take to implement this? Like, you're like, oh, you just go plug it in. It's like, no. John owns Salesforce. It's gonna take to him two hours. That team that owns Snowflake, it's ten hours of table work for them over two weeks. And, really, what you're doing here is, like, you're doing your homework and you're doing their homework for them. You wanna keep uncovering concerns concerns. Like, hey. You guys were worried about the level of effort. Now I have this plan in front of you with every integration. I've sussed out who the owner is of all those integrations, the time it's gonna take them, and at what stage in the project they are going to do that. How does that resonate with you VP of IT? You keep pressing me on resource requirements. Is this enough? No. Okay. What else? If you expect to go win over a VP of IT without understanding who's doing those integrations, the technical process of those integrations, validating that's gonna work, like, you still might close the deal. But a lot of times when you didn't close that deal and you thought it was because your business stakeholder didn't like you, you actually just didn't derisk with IT. You didn't do your homework. You didn't fight for those people to understand what their concerns were around implementation, and you got shot down in some different part of the evaluation process or some different closed doors meeting that you weren't even privy to. So what you're really doing here is identifying risk across the board and eliminating it by doing your homework and coming back with specificity, specificity, specificity. I think the most specific salesperson wins, and uncovering each one of these owners is really what's gonna allow you to be specific. You clearly are nailing these deals when you work with IT stakeholders. And having sold to IT stakeholders in the past, I know that they can be an interesting bunch. And so my question for you is, like, what are some of the common objections or concerns that you frequently hear from IT stakeholders? And what's your approach for addressing those concerns or mitigating the risk that they see? I would say the number one biggest and scariest objection right now, especially where the software industry is going, is, like, tech consolidation and essentially wanting to leverage, like, existing vendors and, like, live in the ecosystem with these vendors. I have always sold niche tools that, like, usually, there's some legacy vendor that has a bolt on that is, like, 10 times shittier than your tool. But to the IT team, it's just like, why does that matter business? Like, go buy the bolt on from Salesforce or NICE or Snowflake. Like, you don't need that niche software vendor. Right? So that IT influence around tool consolidation, it's just them being lazy and not creative and, you know, wanting to to bring in the easy thing that makes them their budget look easier because the incumbent's gonna bundle it in in some commercially pressuring way. You know? So that's, like, one big thing. I'd say the second obvious really big thing is, like, these people run on sprints and, like, resource allocation. Like, a VP of IT, like, their entire almost role is allocating really valuable technical resources against a set of Gantt charts. And, like, what that Gantt chart is is, like, week one, week two, week three, like, these kind of project, like, software and, like, technology rollouts you see. They're managing, like, 25 of these at any given time across a lot of vendors with more spend and more attention, let's say. And they're trying to figure out where can I slot my resources into this where we don't blow everything else up? So always think about how you're fitting into these other project timelines. And then the third thing is just, like, the dependency of integrations and integrated technology. If I integrate these guys with my Snowflake, are they gonna push something that blows up my entire business? So when you think about competing against that legacy incumbent that IT wants to bring on, what this comes down to is getting your champions fired up, building a fantastic business case. Your champions need to go and say, screw that incumbent thing. I've been working with Max on these shadows, and they're and he's told me everything. He's seen those incumbent tools and other shadows. He knows their trash. Here's the seven differentiated ways that Max's company can do that they cannot where we are gonna fail in our higher level business initiatives if we don't go with this best in breed vendor. The second thing on those Gantt charts and those sort of, like, IT implementation resource timelines, that's what we're doing all the shadowing. We're scoping out. Sourcing. Like, look. I know you got all these projects, but I know I'm telling you exactly how many hours across all these people and where that's gonna happen. Because what their instincts could be is, like, it's a million hours. No. It is seventeen hours across these four people at these times. Don't tell me you can't fit it in. I know you can. On the brutalness of integrations and sort of, like, the dependencies, this is where, like, you gotta involve your technical stakeholders. You gotta derisk that. You gotta show them all your documentation. Have intelligent conversations. Follow-up with, like, all the information they need, and keep needling for concerns, and and go coach your champions. What I'll tell my champions is, like, look. Your IT team's trying to shut this down right now. Like, I bet you they're behind closed doors trying to figure out how you don't get this. Are you okay with that? Like, you better go talk to those fools and tell them you want this thing. Like, coach your champion. Tell them be provocative. Like, go fight some people. We could literally do a twelve hour interview with you, and it would be gold. But the clock is ticking. We're running out of time, so we gotta move to the last question, which is we've talked about a lot of really good things salespeople should be doing. Now we gotta flip that question on its head and ask you about a shouldn't. And so my last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it's hurting them actually more than it helps? The number one bad habit I see is avoiding hard conversations, looking for yes, and leading the witness. And these are all different, basically, manifestations of not wanting to have hard conversations, not wanting to hear no, and wanting to keep everything all, you know, light and PG the entire time with having without having a tough conversation. So leading the witness is when in discovery, instead of asking for places where they're not aligned with you or asking those questions around things that, like, they you know, like, not having budget or looking for solutions that you don't solve for. You wanna ask all those questions. I'm like, hey. So you really need this, like, differentiator I got. Right? Of course. You're gonna lead them into talking about all the differentiators, about all your differentiators. Like, you can do that if you want, but it turns out, like, that's seven other things, like, concerns that you don't solve for, that you need to address, that you now don't know because you're leading the witness and not focusing on the things that are more important than the alignment, which is the lack of alignment that you need to suss out and eliminate. And then what this looks like later in the process is just not being willing to call out your champions or call out procurement or whatever it is. You know? Procurement comes, like, give me this massive discount. Like, oh, maybe, I don't know. Like, yeah. Maybe we can do that. Like, you don't have a hard conversation. Like, look. Procurement, like, sounds like you really haven't looked at this business case, so maybe you should go read that. You know? Like, say the hard things, ask the hard questions, and go label things to your champion. Like, if you're seeing things slowing down internally, being like, it looks like you're losing control of this. How do you think things are going? So I think the biggest thing is that when you're looking for yes and when you're looking for all the ways you're aligned, what you're missing out is the most important thing in deal cycles, which is all those unsatisfied concerns that your job as a salesperson is to suss those out and go do your homework and eliminate those. Max, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Max Licht. What do you have for your two? I don't know. Why don't you go first? Okay. That's fine. So number one, if you want to run shadow discovery, you want to first map out five processes that you want your prospect to demo to you. They can be business processes or technical processes. And then for bonus points, you wanna make sure that couple of those five things are areas that are differentiated for your product. So you know that if you're doing a rip and replace, you know those are painful for them today or you know your competitors can't handle that stuff. Number two is if you find that your technical evaluation is going on forever, you should just call it out. So you might just say, like, look. It feels like the business case is a million miles away right now, and that will be a forcing function for your champion to say, no. No. No. No. Here's exactly what we need to see in order to get to a business case so that you can contain the evaluation and not keep going on a demo train. Number three is the specific triggers you can listen for that would prompt you to ask for a shadow session. So there's a couple different places. One, if your prospect tells you that a specific process or work stream that they have to follow is painful and they're looking to make it better, you can ask them to take you through that process, AKA a shadow session. Another way would be is if they ask you about how you handle that process. And if there's any sort of, like, contingency or flexibility or, configuration to how you could handle that process, you can use the shadow session as the reason for, hey. We could show you how this looks. We can take it a million different ways. It would be good to see how you're doing it first. And then number three, another trigger for getting one of those shadow sessions is when they ask you about IT or about integrations, especially when there's some configurability there. So those are your triggers for getting a shadow session. The last one, number four, is anytime you're doing one of these shadow sessions, it's a pretty big give from your prospect. They're taking their time. They're taking their team's time. They're basically showing you a demo. And in order to keep things balanced, you've gotta have a give on your end. Give, forget applies here. So anytime you're doing a shadow session, your prospect should walk away with, Max talked about three different things. He talked about specificity, deliverables, or shareable content that they get in return for doing a shadow session. So some examples include a specific plan to implement that business process you'll be helping with two, an estimate on the number of hours or work needed from their team to implement, or three, details that impact the business case that you're putting together. If your prospect feels like it is worth their time because they're getting things from these shadow sessions, they will continue to opt into them and engage with them. So this is typically the part of the show, Armand, where you say, alright, Nick. How can people help us out? But I'm gonna beat you to the punch and just tell everybody because at the end of this episode, we said, Max, this was freaking amazing. Would you be open to guest writing on our newsletter how you actually break down these shadow sessions? And Max said, yeah. I think I'd be down for that. And I don't know how long it's gonna take Max to write, Armand. It might take him a week. It might take him a month. But if you wanna make sure you don't miss Max's newsletter breakdown of shadow sessions, there's a link in the show notes to subscribe to the 30 MPC newsletter. It would warm my heart if you subscribed. It would mean a lot to Max because I know he's gonna put some work into that just like he did preparing for this episode. We'll see you next week on 30 MPC.
