## Transcript

Good morning, everybody. And welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk and I'm here with my co host Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the one and only CEO of Aligned. His His name is Gal Aga. Nick, why should people listen? Gal takes us through how to attach the problems you solve to the root causes of those problems, to what you're gonna show in a demo, to how you ultimately build out a business case. One of the big things we've been seeing recently is your champions have to sell on your behalf. And if you're not starting from the beginning attaching those things and then codifying it in a way that it can be shared internally on your end, you're gonna struggle. And so Gal takes us us through how to do that in this episode. And three two one let's roll. Alright, Gal. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways so let's get your three. Great. Thanks so much. Excited to be here. So my first takeaway really is what I call the why demo formula. What a product does and how it works is really how 99% of the demos out there look like. And we hear all the time that mantra, demo value, not don't demo features and demo benefits and all that, but what's missing is that there has to be practical framework of how to do this, right? And even great AEs that do great discovery, it always looked like that. There's the good discovery and there's and that and it's there's a pause there at that meeting. And then from that point, it just moves into, here's the products and here's how it works. One of the best ways to go and solve this is planning ahead of time your path. What good looks like? What are the problems that you typically hear? And what are the different demo paths that you use to solve these problems? So for example, at Align, we could hear about multithreading challenges, and the demo path could be uncovering hidden stakeholders and how to use Align to engage new stakeholders. Okay? Or it can be someone talking about how champions failed to to sell internally at the decision stage or mid process. And we could demo the champion enablement capabilities of Align and how we can use Align to simplify the decision process and to better collaborate and co create with champions. Amazing. What's number two? Great. So number two is we focus so much on teaching how to do great demos. And we get the executive meetings, and we run the same process. K? So a a lot of great AEs know that discovery is not a step, and it's something you can do throughout the entire process. But then they get to the executive meetings, and they run the same type of conversation and try to to have a lot of discovery, a lot of questions, a lot of small talk, but that's not how executives buy. So executives get basically, at the end of the day, you lose them in seconds if you lead the with questions and not not lead with insights. So that's really kind of the the the biggest tip that I have there is their executives expect you to already know a lot by the time that you get on that call. You have conversations with the champion. You have conversations with their team, and you've learned a lot of about their business. So leading with insights and not questions basically means that you can talk about the macro macro trends in the market. So as an executive, I'd like to better understand what's really going on right now and to relate a little bit into what behind your solution could drive the urgency and could and make sense to invest in it now. Secondly, I would like to hear about what others like me are saying. What are problems that you're hearing from others in the market and feel like I'm in good hand. And the third thing is what you've learned from speaking with my team. So a recap of what you've learned, and then we can have a conversation. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Beautiful. Round us out, Gal. What's number three? Great. Yeah. So number three is ROI in sales. So 99% of buyers just don't don't buy it. Right? They don't fall for it. They don't believe ROI numbers. The way that it typically works is you get to the end of the process. There's that fancy big calculator, and you ship that calculator. Maybe you plug in a number or two, but, hey, here's your ROI. I think the number one reason that fails is that we're pitching in sales a return before we truly understanding or showing our prospect that we understand their business. Do you wanna know as a seller, what is my current state? What am I trying to accomplish? What's preventing me from getting there? And how do you quantify the problem? Right? What's the cost of me doing nothing? And help me believe also that you can solve my root cause. Only then really go and build an ROI or scenarios. Instead of here's your ROI, build some scenarios that I can go and play with, but there are based really good understanding of my business. So, Gal, in the prep, you walked us through all of the steps of your why demo formula, which was part of your first takeaway. So the step one is you wanna build a map between the problems you solve and the demo paths you could use to solve those problems. Step two is you wanna take notes during discovery of which problems you're going to demo, but then I wanna zoom in on step three, which is once you know which problems you wanna demo, before each demo path, you said you need to recap both the problem and the root cause before you demo anything. I'm hoping that you could unpack that a little bit more for the audience. The whole point of that call is discovery. Right? Discovering that there is a good fit. Okay. Hovering value, big part of it is the problem, but also I need to get the confidence that you can solve my problem. When there's that disconnect, when there's discovery and we talk a lot about problems and then cut, we go into present mode, and then we're just running through present mode, we're missing out tying the connection between the problem and the root cause to the solution. And what that means is that we bring all of the mental load to our prospect to try to make that connection. And most of them don't. Like, they have so many things going on even during this podcast. Like, I'm getting alerts on my, Apple Watch. Right? So many things are grabbing your attention and taking you sideways. A good best practice there is you're going into each of these demo paths of a solution is to recap. Right? So for example, the line be something like, John, earlier you mentioned that your team struggles accessing each role since many of these stakeholders stay hidden behind forwarded emails. And you spoke about how that leads champions to fail internally when they're trying to drive consensus, and, of course, that leads to lost revenue. Right? So when I'm doing something like that, I immediately bring the challenge that we talked about. I'm showing data, listened throughout the conversation, and I now can go and show the solution. When I was in high school and I learned how to write an essay, what I got taught was before each argument or paragraph in the essay, what you're supposed to do is say, hey. Here's what I've told you. Here's what I'm gonna tell you next. And then you give sort of the the argument in the essay, and then you recap it again. And all you're doing is when you're showing a demo of aligned goal, my guess is you're showing six or seven or eight or nine different things. It might be easy for you to follow because you've given these demos a ton. But for your buyer, it can all sort of blend together and there's distractions. And what you're doing when you recap the problems and the root causes is you're almost chaptering your demo and you're putting some structure around things. The other thing about that recap and the root cause is oftentimes when you're showing a demo, you've got new stakeholders in the room. And it can be good for them to hear your understanding of the problem and the root cause because they might not have thought through those things before. It's exactly that. It's framing and chaptering because think about really what's going on. You you end the demo. They go back to their day to day job. Okay? You might follow-up in two weeks because there's vacation, and then they need to go to their manager and and other stakeholders and get more people in a demo. So what's gonna happen? What are they gonna say? They're gonna say, yeah. They do this and you do that, and they show me these features and these features, or are they gonna have clear chapters? They have a solution for better multithreading that does this and something that can help us enable champions when they'll sell internally by doing this and that. Right? By chaptering, you're really creating these easy boot bookmarks, really, of something for them to repeat. So that really makes so much difference because it's less about the how things work, how how the analytics work. It's more about how the solution to your problem would work. The root cause is the linking point or the linkage between the problem and the demo story or the demo path. I remember at Pave when I was teaching my reps to do discovery, it was so, so hard to get them to get an HR person to say, yes. We have massive employee retention issues. And that's the problem. We have a ton of employee retention issues. And they would get so excited when they got that where they'd say, now buy Pave. And and it was like, no. You you skipped one step right there. You need to be able to say, you have employee retention issues. And the reason for that is because employees can't see the value of their cash, equity, and their benefits all in one place, so they think they're being undercompensated. And so let's pretend I'm Nick. I open up my Pave portal, and now what I see is that I've gotten three demotions, two comp decreases if I'm Nick. But if I'm Gall, I'm a better employee. I see I've gotten promoted two times. I see I've gotten my comp increases, and I can see that not only have I gotten salary increases, I've also gotten equity increases. And the only reason you can tell that story is because you said the reason that you have comp related attrition is because employees don't understand this. So I just wanna underline how important that root cause piece is because otherwise you sound like you have pipeline issues, buy a line. There's a middle step that happens between. What happens at the end before you wrap and move to the next part of the demo? It has a lot to do with time. Right? So sometimes you might have done thirty minutes discovery, and then there's just, like, ten minutes maybe to show a few things. But if you have a longer conversation, let's say discovery is in a separate conversation and you're just doing a little bit of a deep dive and then you're showing more of a demo, then I would try between each demo path to validate. So you wanna validate before moving to the next problem and demo path because, again, you saying, here's how I'm gonna solve. Here's the problem. Right? We talked about this earlier, John. Right? And here's the way that this could potentially solve the problem. That only brings you to a certain point. So I would go and do a quick easy question. How do you see your team using this, or how well do you think that this could solve what we talked about earlier? Right? That makes them think. That starts a discussion. That brings up objections. Objections is a good thing, and then we can move on to potentially the next thing. And even if I get two or three demo paths done, that's in most situations, that's enough. We have a deep meaningful conversation around two or three areas of value versus trying to cover a lot of things in the demo. And then someone asked them, what is aligned? They'll just say a lot of different features. We oftentimes call it a future question, which is a lot of times people will do a demo, and they'll ask a present question. And they just ask, how do you do this today? And it just feels like a continuation of doctor's checklist questions or discovery. What asking a future question does is it says, hey. Let's pretend I put this in your hands today. Like, how would your team actually roll it out, or what would you wanna see? It gets them thinking about how they would actually use your solution today and also potentially some of the roadblocks they would run into. You can also ask a past question, which sounds like, hey. You mentioned earlier that your team was having a lot of time struggling with multithreading. Right? I'm curious. Let's just pretend they were using this today. How does this compare to their current process that they're working with? And so you can recap a problem that you discussed earlier, recap the root cause again. And now that you've showed the demo path, you can say, how does this compare to that in the past? So you have future questions which help you make it real. You have past what questions that will contrast your solution with their solution today. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Carl, I wanna ask you about what happens deeper in the sales process. You're the executive buyer and you buy a lot at Aligned. One of the principles that you were telling us about is solving for starvation versus indigestion with information. And I'm curious if you can talk about how can sellers better navigate that decision stage of a deal. The problem today is that buyers don't lack information. Like, there's information overload. Your role as a salesperson is not to try to solve how much information you can give your buyer in order to make a decision. Rather, it's to be a sense maker. How to optimize for better consumption of that information and digestion of that information. So a few examples can be sharing just fewer links, fewer attachments, fewer back and forth and reorganizing all of all of that workflow. Another one would be in its timely. Like, I'm we're right now just building a huge requirement, building documentation. So instead of sending we didn't build a product ebook. We thought it would be much better if we build a requirement builder that has all the different things that you will need to look at when you're buying the usual sales rooms, or how do you use, like, a two to three minute recap video of a use case versus sending a sixty minute Gong call. So that's just one example. Another example could be all of the email link attachment graveyard. That email is where a lot of deals go to die. Salespeople should look at their job as project management of the buying journey. I like saying you're providing buying process as a service. That's your role, and that's how you should look at it. And then email is really a lousy mechanism to do that, and, like, things just get lost. You you send a value summary in email one, a POC summary in email seven, a case study in email 15, pricing in email 25. People are looped in at various point of the process, and then you just dump a lot of information throughout the process. Try to organize it being a little bit self promotional. That's exactly what a deal room does. It keeps everything in one place, but you can also do this with, a Google Drive or with very custom made decks and really just think about what's going on right now, who was looked in, how much do they know why they need to buy, and where we are in the process. I wanna talk about this in the context of a business case because a business case is supposed to be the antidote to indigestion, where I'm taking all of the qualitative things that I've learned about your business. I'm talking about those, how they quantitatively impact the bottom line of the business. And then I'm usually including some things that you would need to act on to achieve those benefits. Those are usually the three parts of business case, qualitative, quantitative, and then what you need to do, implementation, resourcing, things like that. I've seen people have 30 page business cases where it's practically like a Gartner report on its own, and it's every feature page, every case study, a million different things. Could you walk me through what is the flow of a better business case? What are the main chapters in a good business case? So business case, ideally, you want it to be one or two pages of the core of what is the problem that you're trying to solve, what is the root cause behind the problem, What's holding them back? What is costing them to continue this way? Why they must act now? Right? So it's the entire story, and you wanna make sure that there's a compelling story. Where most salespeople miss is when we're selling these products, we're not solving the the problems that most salespeople think that we solve. So I'll give you an example. Both Gong and Aligned, completely different solutions, solve for win rate, and solve for a better deal visibility. But we don't compete. It's a completely different technology. One is a customer facing collaboration tool, another one is about revenue intelligence for actual sales conversations. So they both kind of drive the same value, but what's different is exactly what we talked about earlier is the root cause. The root cause of things that we would solve for is champions failing to sell internally or sellers don't know who the stakeholders are involved in deal. There are sellers losing control over a complex POC because they're failing to project manage the deal and create alignment with their champion, for example. So you wanna make sure that really your narrative of writing that business case gets into that level of root cause language. And the root cause is also not enough because the executive is gonna ask, okay. Why why haven't we done anything so far? Why can't we solve this in other ways? And how important is is to solve? And why is this more important than other priorities? So just really put the questions that an executive might ask in your mind, and then this would be the framework. The solution part, it should be a smaller piece. It's more about really framing a very compelling problem to make sure that someone spends budget. What's interesting is you talked about, okay, how else have they tried to solve this problem? And even earlier, you were talking about, well, people could solve the multithreading, the hidden stakeholders, the champion enablement problem with aligned, but they could also solve it other ways. You were like, they could set up a Google Drive. They could could have a shared PowerPoint deck. When you explain to your customer, hey. There's other ways to solve this problem beyond buying something from me. One, it makes you look more credible. But then two, you can include that in that business case when you really build out the problem. Hey. There's lots of different ways you can solve this. It doesn't sound very attractive to me as an executive to have my entire team set up Google Drives to share with all of my customers. It probably sounds more compelling to end up working with Aligned. Yeah. So I wanna go back to the ROI case that you talked about at the beginning of the show. So step one, you understand their business, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And then from there, the next thing you're doing is you're quantifying the cost of an action. Can you talk to me about how you do that stuff? That's at the end of day. That's the return. Right? That's the opposite of return. So for me to see a return, there has to be a problem that I believe is equivalent to that potential return. Right? So the fact that Acme, for example, 10 x their pipeline using my solution doesn't mean that any other customer will will achieve that same result because it might be that Acme didn't have SDRs or weren't doing anything in the first place. Or their emails were really, really bad, and then the solution took them very, very bad situation to hear. Right? So the concept of quantifying the problem is called really cost of inaction. And let's take an example from a line. So if we wanna go and build a very tailored ROI, then we would go and think about let's say okay. So telling us that their challenge is timeline, their challenge is cycle is getting longer, and it's getting longer because POCs get dragged. Okay. How much is the POC causing the timeline to get longer? Okay. Oh, it's getting dragged from two to five weeks? Wow. That's significant. How many of these POCs get dragged from two to five weeks? Fifty percent of them. Okay. The fifty percent of these POCs that get dragged from two to five weeks, can you isolate them and tell me what's the win rate and cycle length in these POCs? Here here it is. And then I'm getting really to a cost. I can go and say, overall, we're working x amount of deals. Half of them are getting stuck in the POC, and it's getting dragged from two to five weeks. And that's worth that much in in in win rate, that much in sell cycle times the ACV. That's the outcome. To bring this full circle, this really ties to the demo framework that you talked about earlier, which is first thing you're doing is you're quantifying the problem. And let's say for the ex the example that we used earlier is I need to quantify your team is struggling with multithreading. What does that mean? What is the average win rate when you have power versus you don't have power? And how many deals is that impacting? If you have a 100 deals, half of your deals don't have power, you have a 20% lower win rate. Boom. That's an ARR opportunity. From there, you attach that dollar number to the root cause that you can solve in your demo flow, and that's the next step in your business case. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Talk to me about I have multi threading as a problem. Align can help with that root cause. I have next thing is my problem. Driving time line is my next problem. Align can help with that. You talked about building scenarios, not a dream outcome. What's an example of building scenarios in an ROI case? What am I going to believe? If you're gonna show me just one scenario, then, okay. That number looks great. That looks big. But it's same thing as negotiation. Right? We wanna give options. That's a good best practice. Like, giving options shows me that I can play around with this, that this is not this is not accurate. This is not really what this is gonna be. This is just us building together as partners some hypothesis an hypothesis of how this is gonna play out potentially. And as I'm going through the process with you as a buyer, then we're really cocreate and co codesign this, then it makes it more believable. So what I would go and do is build scenarios that one of these scenarios is the cost of inaction. So if we understood that that dragged POC is leading to, I don't know, million dollars in lost, ARR, so that's one ROI scenario. But then try to create scenarios that are not as great. Because if the problem today is that and you're fully solving the problem, what about it's all about risk management. What what about if we solve the problem by 50%? If the implementation doesn't go well or if people don't adopt it in the same way or maybe the problem is also tied to skills and you can't fully solve it. Okay? So build more scenarios for me to also understand what is the worst case scenario look like. And I think that what most sellers are trying to do here, they're trying to show 10 x, 20 x, like, crazy numbers, but buyers don't need that. Like, they don't buy only because of impact. Okay? There are many other benefits that are many other things that are nonmeasurable, and they get that. So as long as that you can show two, three x as the, you know, as a good baseline, just show a few more scenarios that are even worse. That's okay. When you model out those not as good scenarios, it also helps you prevent against future objections. Exactly. It's showing a good worst case is it sounds like it's the best, way to sell. Show me a good worst case. Amazing. I'm curious with your worst case. Is that oftentimes not recouping the investment? Like, how bad of a worst case can you get away with showing? And the reason that I ask is people will try to do this when we sell thirty minutes to presidents club sponsorships all the time. Well, they'll be like, okay. I can't attribute the impact of your social posts. I can't attribute the impact of your podcast ads. I can look at how many webinar leads actually bought our software. And so that's my worst case scenario. Only this portion of the sponsorship that I can actually track. And oftentimes, that actually makes a decent dent into the cost itself. But sometimes, I'm like, no. Like, that worst case is actually, like, a fraction of what you're buying. So how bad can your worst case be relative to what you're asking them to pay for? You need to really create realistic scenarios. Right? And if your worst realistic scenario doesn't return the investment, doesn't recoup it, but there are other amazing benefits and you think it still makes a strong enough case, yeah, try to say, yeah. I still believe that we have a good partnership here. If you don't, then don't sell that deal. It's not about where you're trying to put that case at. It's trying to just find what's reasonable because then at the end of the day, you're gonna face the customer tomorrow, and that's brand, and that's long term relationship, and that's retention, and that's potential expansion. Right? So SaaS is not about the sale. It's about long term sales, and long term retention is going to growth. Oftentimes, we think of ROI in three different levels. The first is the trackable stuff, the people who download your asset, the people who sign up for the webinar. And that's, like, the bare bones. It's literally only the people that you have track of. The base case, the middle case is if you start to scale that up and you assume that there are people that you can't track on the podcast, their impressions, and you can scale that up. And you can start to say, okay. If, like, we can only track a quarter of our traffic, what does this remaining 75% of your sponsorship get you? And that's sort of your middle case. The final case is when you can start to get the emotional reasons, which is if you're telling me that between the cost of the leads, you can actually track, the untrackable leads you can't see, and the brand halo effect of making sure that everyone actually knows who the heck you are. If I can't make up the ROI between all three of those things altogether, then honestly, you probably shouldn't be working with us. And by having their commodity case as the worst case scenario, it almost puts it out there versus leading with only the dream case scenario where it's like there's untrackable stuff, there's trackable stuff, and there's dream outcome stuff. They oftentimes tear down the entire thing versus acknowledging their worst case scenario as the first case. And showing that worst case scenario when someone buying after they're seeing that worst case scenario, they're gonna be a better customer versus you're only showing that dream. And then if they get to the worst case, and the worst case is good. Let's talk about a good worst case. Okay? They're gonna be upset because you sold them the dream. Amazing. Well, clock is ticking, and we are running out of time. So we gotta move to the final question, which is this. We've talked about a lot of really good things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? We have this mantra in sales always have a next call booked. I would challenge that mantra with replacing it with a better question. How are you supporting your buyer's next steps? Always have your buyer's next steps supported. So I would much rather hearing my sales team saying in a forecast call, pipeline meeting, we're right now working asynchronously on a business case. Okay? And they're gonna present it internally versus I have a weekly catch up. Okay. What are you doing? How is the deal progressing? Have the confidence to work with your champion as asynchronously and really ask yourself all the time, how are you driving the deal forward, not how are you getting control. It's not really control. You're not really in control eventually. At the deal, you can influence it, but you can never control it. Amazing. Gal, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alright, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Gal Aga. What do you have for your two? Before you even go into a discovery call, you need to have a clear sense of the problems you solve, the root causes for those problems, and then the demo paths or the value stories that you're ultimately going to show and tell. You want to know what you're looking for when you go into a conversation with your buyer rather than just hoping they're going to know exactly why they should buy and what you should show. My second one is when you are building out a business case, do not just model out one scenario instead especially with ROI model out a not so good, a pretty good, and a best case scenario. This not only makes you come across more impartial and more realistic it also can help overcome objections to your business case. Number three, link the problem to the solution using the root cause. So a lot of times people will say things like, oh, you have pipeline generation issues. You should buy my product. But you need to be able to say you have pipeline generation issues because your reps are struggling with cold calling, and for that reason, they need a cold calling training, for example. And then lastly, number four, demo in stories, not in features. I find a lot of reps will get to the magic moment where they're ready to demo the problem they can solve. And instead of speaking in the day in the life of an employee where you might say, well, Nick opens up his portal and here's what he sees. They say, this is a page that adds compensation plus equity plus benefits. And they are literally just describing the feature. So describe the demo in terms of the day of the life of the problem. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So, Armond, you and I put together a number of 30 MPC, what we call buyer enablement templates with the team at Align, and that includes things like a mutual action plan, business case templates, and deal rooms, the 30 way. There is a link in the show notes to go get that. If you like some of what Gal was talking about today and you wanna see how 30 can help you put that into action, it's free. Go check them out, and they should be helpful. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
