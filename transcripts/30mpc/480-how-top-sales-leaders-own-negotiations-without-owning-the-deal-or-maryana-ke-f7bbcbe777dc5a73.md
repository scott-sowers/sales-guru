What is a leader? The goal is revenue. It comes down to empowering your reps to do their best work. I do think that respecting your leader as someone that can do your job better than you is important. Like, you wanna be learning from the best. As a leader, staying involved in the deals is an important thing from garnering respect and having that go both ways and not just sitting from some ivory tower and, like, spewing knowledge that is no longer relevant. How do you make sure that you don't go into super rep territory is it's not your deal to win. It's the rep's deal to win. And making sure that the rep stays in the driver's seat and you're there to support them. Sometimes that is interjecting when a conversation's going sideways, asking the hard question that the rep needs to save face on. It's knowing your role, but it's to support the rep in winning. It's not yours to win. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my host, Mark Cosclo. And today, we have the VP of sales and partnerships over at Leighton Health. Her name is Mariana Castle. Mariana, by background, is a multiple time presidents club winner as both a leader and a rep. She closed 8 figure deals as both a leader and a rep. Not 7 figure, but that means $10,000,000 plus deals. And she is putting on a master class on how to lead an enterprise sales organization and get involved to bring big deals over the line. Mark, why should people listen? What I took away with from Mariana was I think she's a extremely high bar. And there's a saying of, like, you know, you can lead from the front, and you can hurt you, you can lead from the back. I think Mariana has a new way. You can lead from the pack. And I think that's what she's done, and she is leading by being in the trenches with her reps every day. And I think in this episode, you can find a way to be more involved with your reps that helps your street cred, which will help you be a better leader. And three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, Mariana. Welcome to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. The first takeaway is get in the trenches when you're on sales calls with your reps. I think it's so important for leaders to lead from the front, get into the details, and deal with objections head on. Specifically, the rep is the driver of the car. I am the passenger. But I have a really unique position in being able to bring clarity to the conversation. So, for example, you know, if someone is getting into the weeds and we're talking about something really specific and nuanced, I can actually bring that conversation back up and say, like, why does this matter to you? Or let me ask a silly question. You know? How did we get here? Or was this discussed before? And so I think bringing that clarity and that levity is really, really important to remaining focused on what the goal is. And the second position that I have on calls is being able to pull the conversation up to ensuring that we are actually getting to an the outcome that we want. It's very hard to always be actively listening. There might be multiple stakeholders on the call kind of, watching the the conversation unfold. I have the ability to then call on someone who might be a little bit more quiet or, who isn't as, you know, isn't participating as much. And that's a a really important position for a leader to take on calls. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Awesome. What's number two? Number two is, when in doubt, get on a plane. I think that, you know, in enterprise sales, there's not a single decision. There's not a single 6 figure plus deal that is made by one person anymore. It's all made by committee. And you're gonna feel in moments that you're stuck. Right? Whether that's communication with the client is getting a little bit terse or they're not replying as quickly or you're feeling like, hey. Yes. We know that the contract is being reviewed illegal, but we're not getting any sort of updates or clarity on that. At those moments, get on a plane. Because when someone is with you in person, they're actually going to, you know, break down those walls, open up to you. I'll give an example. We're working on a pretty significant deal with a large health system in New York, and we were getting these kind of like, hey. It's in progress. It's in progress. We showed up. We brought them breakfast, and I had a fifteen minute conversation outside of a conference room where we got the real scoop of what was going on. And I think, you know, in large deals, it's, it's normal for the client to be a little bit hesitant on unveiling all the things going on. And so when you're with someone in person, it does really open up the opportunity to connect. Great. What's number three? No surprises and good vibes. I wanna make sure that my team knows exactly how I feel, what's going on in the in the company, what to expect, good, bad, ugly, or otherwise. It goes both ways. I'll give an example. One of my reps, just last week had forecasted a deal that I ended up taking out of my forecast, and I shared that back with the entire team and explained why. You know, we didn't have an executive alignment. We weren't getting visibility onto when the contract would be signed, when implementation would start. And I think that that was, a tough moment, but it's important that everyone understands how I'm thinking through these different opportunities and what is needed to really get a deal into a place to be forecasted. So it was about the teaching opportunity and also that connection with my team that we are we are one team, but in order to meet the forecast, we have to we have to do more. And then good vibes, like, sales is hard. It's really tough. And, you know, being with someone who's upbeat and keeps energy high, like, that is, I think, a really important piece of a leader is to make sure that the team stays in good spirits, especially when it's tough. When I hear how you describe what you do, I think about when I was a rep. Mhmm. And I think I would love to have a leader like you that's willing to, like, come sell with me, not try to sell me on how to be a better seller. Right? And one of the things that I think that it begs the question of is there's a concept of, alright, there's, a super rep, a a manager that's a super rep. I believe it's a super rep that comes in and does the deals for the reps. And then there's one that creates self sufficient reps that can do that. They're on their own, and we come in and work together on things. How do you make sure you're not straying into super rep land when you're activated in this way? It's a really good question. I think let's take that a step back and kind of divide the question into a couple of of parts. So, what is a leader? Right? I think, you know, whether you're a manager, you're a director, you're a VP, the goal is revenue. Right? And so you wanna make sure that you're gaining revenue as sustainably as possible, and it comes down to empowering your reps to do their best work. I do think that respecting your leader as someone that can do your job better than you is important. Like, you wanna be learning from the best. And so staying as a leader, staying involved in the deals is an important thing from garnering respect and having that go both ways. Right? Actually understanding what your reps are going through and not just sitting from some ivory tower and, like, spewing, you know, knowledge that is no longer relevant. So getting in the deals, I think, is very, very important. How do you make sure that you don't go into super rep territory is it's not your deal to win. It's the rep's deal to win. And making sure that the rep stays in the driver's seat and you're there to support them, sometimes that is, you know, interjecting when a conversation's going sideways. Sometimes that is, you know, asking the hard question that the rep needs to save face on. So it's knowing your role, but it's to support the rep in winning. It's not yours to win. You talk about, hey. I'm in calls all the time. I need to know how do you figure out how to be in calls. You only have ten hours a day, eight hours a day, however often you work. You have a bunch of executive and leadership stuff to do. Then you have all these calls. Like, how many calls a day do you allow yourself? Like, what kind of calls are you in? Like, help me take me through the decision tree of how do I manage my time but still be in calls all the time? I work a lot. I'll just start there. But what I think is very important is, again, not losing sight of the goal. So I'm ruthless with my time. I will join. A customer meetings always come first. Always. There's no question about that. It's customers, and then it's my team. Then it's leadership, then it's everything else. And so making sure well, recruiting is very high up there as well because that is my team. I will prioritize based on where I'm going to add the most value. So I ask my teams to include me on calls because I wanna join as many as possible at all times. It's often that I'm, like, quadruple booked. So it doesn't stress me out anymore. I just make the decision based on what's going on. If a sensitive situation is going, I'm absolutely gonna join that call, and we're gonna do a prep and a post call debrief. However, like, it's also good to just listen in. Right? Whether it's an implementation or something that might not even be directly relevant, like, I wanna hear how things are going so I can continue to inform our strategy. I think it's very easy to get caught up in a lot of internals. Like, let's strategize about this, or let's go in and plan on x y z. I ask my counterparts to loop me in when I can make a decision. But while you're figuring out the plan and all these other things, like, I need to focus on revenue. So I think it's a combination of just working a lot and being really focused on your time. I wonder on the answer to this question. Can you give, like, an example of, like, two or three places you would jump into a deal? Because I know you're having your reps pull you in any and every deal. But I if you could even give an example of, like, this is how I would say bring me into early stage deals, mid stage deals, and late stage deals, I think that would make it, like, just a little bit more actionable so I could tell my team, these are the three great example moments. You know what I mean? Yeah. And and then I'll I'd also do the flip of ones where you would never jump on a call. Let's start with the ones where I would. So I think in early stage calls, when I can bring the company vision, there's a lot of times in, well, I'll I'll speak to health care, but folks are not gonna just sign up with you because you solve a single problem. They wanna partner with you for the longer term. And so having the visibility that I have over many, many of our customers, how they started with us, where they're going, and our road map, that is better delivered generally by an executive than by a rep just from that vantage point. So that's from an early stage. On a mid stage, there might be scenarios in which you get, an objection of, well, so and so can do this or it's just not a priority And coming in to have the tough conversation, that's oftentimes where I will come in or ask my team to pull me in as well. At the end of the deal, I often am the businessperson negotiating the agreement, So we'll do that in combo with our with our attorney. But there's a lot of business terms. So coming in and being able to make the call on payment terms or on the duration of the contract or any of these kinds of things, that's where I like to be looped in. So vision slash road map Mhmm. High level objections that the rep just is really struggling to get around. Or it comes off differently from a leader than an AE. I mean, there is some of that, but, you know Yeah. Well, you know and sometimes, reps just they aren't equipped to deal with something they've never heard of, or they don't have enough insight into how the company works to really answer the question. And, you know, their their surface where you can go super deep because you just understand more. And then the last is, going over, like, negotiation business term type of things where, like, there could be a mistake that could be made that could be really bad for the deal or the company or the customer. Or I could speed up the deal, which is more often what I look to do of, like, I'll give on this if you can do that. And I can make that decision because I own it. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. So, whereas a rep would have to write up a business proposal to me, and we have to do the whole thing. Like, I'd rather just be in there and and make it happen. Yeah. I'll I'll never forget. I we were closing a humongous telecom company, multimillion dollar deal. And I called the rep, like, two or three days before, and we were having our big negotiation deal with the actual economic buyer that had budget. And I was like, hey. Let's let's role play this thing. Let's talk through it real quick. Oh, yeah. I love that. And, he felt lost. He, like, didn't know where to start, and so that's where I was like, okay. If we if I don't come on this call, we're gonna either agree to a discount that's gonna be onerous. I'm gonna get my butt chewed out, or we're gonna lose the deal. Like, that was the only two options because in our role play and in practicing with him, it was clear to me that he didn't have another lover to go to other than discount. And so what I did is I was like, hey. Listen. Why don't you let me model the call, street cred? Mhmm. And I'll show you how to create other lovers in this negotiation. And let's also, let's fill out with a little negotiation worksheet. Let's fill out this worksheet to see what we can do. And I think that, you know, a a great place to a great framework to use or decision making process to use to get into calls is look through your deals each week. We're the most important meetings that week. Call those reps or Slack them just real quick. Like, do a little voice note in Slack and be like, hey. Tell me how you're gonna deal with this little thing that you're over here because I'm seeing this thing. And if they don't do it well, ask if you can model it and help them out in in a call or role play it ahead of time. And if they can't get there, then you gotta be there. I agree. I think it should also be a call to you that if you are not being asked to be on calls, there's probably a reason for that. So be be vulnerable. Ask. Right? Like, hey. I see this really important call. You know, there might be a reason why you didn't ask me to be there. Like, I wanna hear your feedback and make and be genuine about that. Like, you actually need to want to know the answer to it so that you can get better. That would definitely be a call out to me. So, Mariano, let's go through the negotiation example. So you talked about your reps bring you into late stage deals so that you can manage the negotiation. Maybe they can save face. Mhmm. First, let's break this down step by step. When in a negotiation should a rep be bringing you in? Is it the rep's already gotten tapped out three times and, like, you're already at 20% discount, you gotta draw the line? Or do you wanna be brought in with the moment the negotiation even starts in the first place? In enterprise sales, it's the moment that it starts or after the first round. So it would depend on the rep's experience, what the scenario is, but very quickly and early on, we should be doing it together. Tell me what stage the deal needs to be in for you to consider the negotiation to have begun. Is it, like, do they need to be at a certain level of power? Because I'm sure it's not they're just sharing a range. Right? Like, what's your criteria for, like, alright. This is a negotiation that I'm ready to take on as a sales leader. Mhmm. So we need to have executive alignment that it makes it makes sense to move forward. Before then, we're still we're still in the selling part. Right? I actually talked to my team about two parts of a deal very tactically. Like, one is, do you want to do this? And then two is, how do we do this part? Again, I'm working with very complex systems. There's a lot of players involved. There's a lot of committees. The when we get to how do we do this, that's when you should loop me in always. Yeah. Because now we have to navigate through, you know, many committees and many different teams. Mark actually got me to change the way that I built my own sales stages. Before, it used to be stage one is discovery. Stage two is demo. Stage three is multithreading. And instead, I rewrote them as the things that I'm trying to get from my customers. So stage one is problem agreement. Stage two is solution agreement. Stage three is power agreement. Power agrees that this is a problem we're solving. And at that point, that's usually when same side selling begins. In other words, we all want the same thing to happen, but now we need to go into the last two stages, which is commercial agreement. We need to make sure that the numbers and the contract make sense. And then vendor approval. We need to make sure you can pass security review on that. I love that. I love that. Happened. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. No. No. Ours are discovery, defining the solution, on-site, and executive engagement because those are the things that we need to get. We go into early contracting, which is, like, we have decided that we wanna do this, but now we've gotta go through all of the security reviews, AI reviews, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. We have to go into the beginning of breadlining, then we get to finalizing the agreement because there's so many things that can happen there. So I love the way that you think about what is the thing we wanna get out of it. The exit criteria are have we accomplished these outcomes. So your rep is like, alrighty, Mariano. Like, I haven't even gone through the first cut in the negotiation. So you're going in, you're talking to a COO or a CFO. You jump on that call. Bev actually, before you jump on that call, what do you need from your rep in the prep for the negotiation? Why are they doing this? Who are the players involved? How do they feel about us? When is their timeline? What have they shared to you? I I like to divide this also, all these categories, into what do we think we know versus what do we know we know. Mhmm. And I actually have that built out. What was the price that was listed? How do they respond to it? Where do we think we'll land and why? And when when I say where do we think we land, price is one small part of that. It is how many modules are they going forward with? When, how, why? Who's signing? What is the term? Do we get logo rights? Like, a lot of different components to that. And so we basically do a where are we starting and where do we think we'll end? What is our, like, walk away? And, what's our strategy going into it? The what do we know we know and what do we think that we know? Yeah. That's the riddle. That is the riddle. How are you figuring out the difference when a rep's like, oh, yeah. They said this, this, and this. And you're like, that's an I think, not an I know. Like, how tell me how can you ask. Like, give give me an example. Or if you wanna role play it, I'm happy I'd love to role play. It's like, hit hit me up. Like We're doing a very large deal with the largest health system that is near you. You're the rep. Yeah. Let's role play. So you you think that it's gonna go into like, we've got the approvals, and and they're ready to sign. Alright. Hey, Mariana. Yeah. Great call with the CEO. He's seen you know, I think everything he said sounded like they're moving in the right direction. He said he'll get back to me in a couple weeks, and we should be moving right into legal. Uh-huh. Why is it commit. Yeah. Okay. Why is it gonna take a couple weeks? What are we missing? I don't know. He just said he would get back to me in a couple weeks. Okay. Have we done all of the procurement processes that we need to, the security review, the governance counsel, the AI review? I think that's hope well, no. We haven't done any we haven't we've done a couple of those things, but we're in the middle of some other stuff. But he's ready to go. I'm telling you. Like, this guy wants to get us get he wants to get busy. Okay. Well, we need to follow-up with the different councils and committees and receive their approval. Can you do that? I don't know. Maybe. What makes you think that he's ready to sign? It'd be pretty strange for a CEO of a health system to just override their security team. Yeah. I I don't know. He seemed really excited, and he, like, really loved our demo. Why is he so excited? He loved the demo. I mean, he she's like, this is exactly what we need. This is exactly how we need to fix this problem. Why is that problem so urgent? Alright. So guess that's what I'm feeling, Armand. I'm feeling Jordan Chavez, five wise, baby, right here. What you're doing, Mariana, is, you know, there's this concept called the Chinese five whys. It's basically a Chinese parable that talks about, you know, you know, you can't continue to lie after somebody asks you why five times. You're just not creative enough. So it sounds like that's what you're doing. You're making people get to a place of evidence versus their perception of reality. And until you feel evidence, you keep asking for why until they probably, like me in this role play, realize the I shouldn't have just said what I just said five minutes ago. And and I think the important thing to call out here is I'm not trying to put someone in a corner. What I'm trying to call out is have we looked at all of the steps that we're go because they're always gonna come up. Like, there's no way. Like, this is not magic. You know? There's gonna be certain steps that you need to check off when you're doing very large deals. And so have we checked them off? And I have a scenario right now where I'm not sure if we actually received approval on something. So what do I do? I pick up the phone and I call. Because, like, you have to be able to check that off at because they're gonna ask for that as well. When was it approved? Right? You need to be able to offer that back to the customer. And when you're working with, you know, very spread out organizations or multiple committees, they're not communicating internally. So being able to be that project manager and have those things buttoned up, that's going to help push your deal along faster. You talked in prep, and we talked a little bit about the forecasting thing, and you called something called Mariana Math. It put it I'll pull a deal out of that forecast if I don't feel like it adds up. Right? Yeah. Help me like, do you have, like, a set of required things? I I know you probably have 20 of them, but give me, like, the nonnegotiable, absolutely evidentiary proof that this and then that you feel like, hey. If I don't have this, I'm taking you out. If you do have this, I feel decent. Executive alignment. And by that, I mean, did an executive person who can sign the paperwork say yes to this, both to the product and to the price? Two. Did we get a red line back? Yes or no? Yeah. Again, we're we're things take a long time in in health care. So if we didn't have a red line back, it might as well not even exist. And then three, do we know when they need to get this going? That's a very important point too because we often you know, as we're transitioning from account executives to account managers, having that implementation timeline is a very real thing because that's when we have their commitment from their IT team to to actually start moving. Yeah. And that's what's needed for, like, a commit deal in your forecast. Right? Yes. So question for you. When it comes to getting a red line back, I called this, red line deadlines when I was leading the sales team at Pate. I mean, it's like, you gotta do a red line deadline. Right? It's like, if I give them a contract, I need to have a deadline for when I need first cuts back because the battle in legal is not getting the contract done. It's getting the contract to even be prioritized Prioritized. You. So what are some hacks or tricks or ways that I can, in health care, the slowest industry in the world behind government tech, How do I get first cuts on red lines back more quickly? Very tactically, you need multiple seat level executives who want to do this. And you get them to do and you get those conversations because you're building that vision. You're having conversations at that level. It's more than just the point solution. Like, those are really, really important pieces. Multiple c level connects is is critical. The other piece is demo to the legal team. Bringing it to real life, like, people are in health care because they actually care about making things better. When they see what this like, what our product is solving, they do have that emotional connection, and they will prioritize it. And the last thing that I'll say, and this is so simple and silly, but, like, be someone who they want to work with. And when they feel like they want you to win too, there's a different level of, like, hey. Can you do me a favor? Internally? And that's really when we start to see sales cycles shorten is when the person on the on the other side wants you to win too. I can't stress that last one enough. I had a, a really great seller who was doing okay, but he had the potential to do better. And he's the type of person that, like, my daughter would go babysit his kids, and we would go out to dinner together. Like, just a really still a good friend. Just talked to him this week. His unlock was he needed to realize that people wanted to buy from him as a person, not him as a rep. And so I remember one time in a deal, I was like, listen. You know, I just heard you talk about this stuff. Did you ever send them a picture of your kids? And they're like, no. And I'm like, you need to, like, put a little like, you just talked about this trip you in on this, and your kids did this. Send them a picture of the trip. The minute that he saw what happened when he made himself a human and not a selling robot, he immediately, like, sky like, it changed the course of his career. And he we kinda had this hilarious thing, but he had his own sequences and outreach that were all, like, pictures of his kid. And he'd be like, okay. Once I get into my the family situation, I'm throwing him in the family sequence, and the family sequence is gonna give me the deal on because people do wanna buy from humans. And we can do all of these other things and check all these other boxes. But in the end, if they don't like us, if they don't feel like they can connect with us, then there's a part of the trust that's not there that's required to do these live deals. It's funny that you bring that up because I actually Ben Braverman, who is the former CRO of Flexport, actually taught me how to eat in front of customers. I was so nervous. It was the first time being an enterprise rep. I was, like, 27 or something, and I was wearing this, like, suit. And I was just, like, so stressed out because I look young. I am young. I'm selling to a pretty kind of stodgy industry. And he's like, Mariana, you have to eat. Like, you have to when you're at, like, a a networking thing or you're going to a customer, like, you have to bring them lunch because if you eat in front of someone, it just lowers all of the pressure. Interrupt. And it, I couldn't handle it. I was like, there's no way. I'm gonna have, like, crumbs on my face and blah blah blah. And he was like, Mariana, just do it. And it totally changed the way that I think about things because we are humans. And if you have that, you know, authenticity is a new currency. Like, you have to be authentic. So I love the idea of sharing photos of your kids and all of that as long as it's genuine. As long as you actually want to do that and someone's connecting with you in that way. Like, I have some customers, hey. You're going to Maui. Like, here's a recommendation of a wonderful place. Or, you know, someone will say something about something that happened to them, and I'll, like, send them, like, a little something in in the mail or whatever because it's I actually want that relationship. So I think that yeah. When you kind of do it at scale, it's a little bit more of a mentality than it is, like, a tactic. There's something about in person interactions. There's a saying of, like, stand tall and own your space. And, like, the sign of an awkward dinner is we're three people on a show. If they served us four dumplings, that last dumpling would sit there for, like, ten minutes. And, like, that's the sign that people aren't comfortable with each other versus if we were all friends and fine dandy, we would be fighting over it. I would eat three before March, and then, Mariana, you would have nothing to eat. Right? And so, like, you have to break these, like, BS mannerisms early. There's one time I went to an on-site with one of the top producing insurance agents I'd ever worked for, and we went into the lobby, and I sat down on the chair. And we were waiting for the managing partner to come out. And he was like, uh-uh. Up. And I was like, up. I was like, don't sit down. And he takes me over to the window. He's like, he's like, when that guy comes in, I don't want him being like, oh, now I'm like, ruffling my suit and putting my suitcase away and, like, standing up all, like, polite and stuff like that. It's like, I'm gonna be comfortable in my space as if I was, like, in my friend's living room. And he starts looking through, like, the pro bono booklet and all this stuff. And then the managing partner walks in, and the guy turns around and he's like, oh, look. Mister pro bono decided to join us today. And the guy started laughing because he was holding up this fat pro bono book, which is, like, twice the size as a normal pro bono book in a law firm. And, like, he just made himself comfortable in the space, and the guy just opened up in the meeting because he broke the traditional corporate norms. You you have to be you. Right? Yes. Be professional. Be courteous. Do all of these things. But at the end of the day and I've been very fortunate. I've only really worked for companies that I truly believe in. For me, I I want to solve this problem genuinely. And so when I'm talking with people, it feels like we're actually doing something worth doing. And so I think if you can be yourself and whatever you know, you don't always get the opportunity to to sell something you really care about. I wanna be realistic about that. But find find your reason of why you want this person to succeed. Maybe it's because they're gonna get a promotion for, you know, growing their organization or they'll lower their risk or whatever else. And if you can connect with that, I think that that is ultimately why, you know, I've been successful both as a as a rep and a leader and also in in bringing the right folks to your organization because they wanna do that too. Amazing show. We have to move to the final segment, and the final segment is the final four. It's four rapid fire questions that I'm gonna ask you off the cuff, and your goal is just answer them with the first thing that comes to the top of your head. You ready? Yeah. Sounds good. Number one. What's your number one interview question? What is a deal that you lost, and what will you do differently? And I know this is a pretty common one, but I want to feel pain when I ask them this. Because if you like, every successful salesperson I've ever worked with, they can rattle off their big wins. But when you ask them about something they lost, it still hurts, and that is what keeps them going, and that is what makes them, you know, so motivated to do better. A masochist at the best. What is the number one culture killer on a sales floor? A combination of lone wolf ism, being too good for the job. You know? Hey. That's not my job. I'm not gonna do it. It's someone else's responsibility. And then also from a leadership standpoint, accepting mediocrity. We set the tone for what we expect. And so those combos, you gotta watch out for them. What is the number one thing you can do to earn your team's respect? Do the work. What is the number one way to get promoted to being a sales leader? You obviously have to be a good rep. Right? You you I think that's a prerequisite. The biggest difference between a rep that's great and a future leader is someone that's cross functional, someone that really looks at the organization as a whole, looks at revenue as a whole. Right? It's not just closing the deal. It's setting them up for success. It's making sure that account management or customer success has what they need, that you're collaborating with product and engineering, giving feedback, really owning the entire process, that's what sets up someone to be a leader. Awesome. Marianne, amazing show. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Mark. It's time for a three step recap and one thing you can do. So three step recap. Step number one, you gotta get involved in deals, but don't just jump into security reviews. In the early stages, you can get involved in vision selling as a leader. In the middle stages of a deal, if you're getting blockers or if people are saying it's not a priority, you can come in to unblock or save a deal. And then in the late stages, you can be the negotiator in a deal. So that's number one. Number two, when you're starting to get deals hitting your forecast, you need three things to be true. Number one, do you have exec alignment on product and price? Number two, do you have a red line back? And then number three, do they know when they need to get it going? And then lastly, when you're beating up a deal, the six questions Mariana asks are, why are they doing this? Who's involved? What's the timeline? What is the price listed at? Where do we think we will land? And why? That was those are the six questions that Mariana asks before she gets involved in the negotiation. And then she asks, what do we think we know versus what do we actually Alrighty, Mark. What's one thing people can do right now? I think what people should go do right now is get rev ops or somebody, if you're a sales leader, to create you a report that you get in your inbox every Sunday night. And that report shows you every major deal that has a meeting that week. And what you should spend Monday morning doing is pinging your reps on Slack, being like, hey. So you have a meeting this weekend with IBM. It looks like it's a negotiation call. And then ask one critical question that you need an answer to to see if they can answer and how to answer it. And then based on that, that will tell you if you need to be involved in that meeting or not. And if you get into a nice cadence where you're seeing the eight, ten, twenty, thirty really important meetings in your team each week, and you're making sure that reps are prepared and taking time to do that and then joining the calls where you don't feel like they're quite ready, I think that that is a really great way to figure out how should you take a part of your week in being in calls. Well, folks, if you liked this one, then we put together a newsletter a while back on how to run pipeline reviews that don't suck. And a lot of what we talked about today was derisking deals. So there's a link to that down in show notes. And Mariana is also hiring, so please go connect with her on LinkedIn. Her LinkedIn is also down in the show notes, and we will see you on the next one.
