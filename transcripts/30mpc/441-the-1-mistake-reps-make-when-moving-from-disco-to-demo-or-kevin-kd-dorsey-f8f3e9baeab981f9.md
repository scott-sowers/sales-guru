## Transcript

Morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Froeck, and I'm here with my host, Nick Sigelski. And, folks, we've never had this gentleman on the show before. His name is Kevin KD Dorsey. He's actually been on the show approximately 17 times at this point. He was also on this show last week. And so this is a two part, part two of a two part discovery series with the legendary Kevin Dorsey. If you're not familiar with him, he is a four time CRO slash VP of sales of $100,000,000 plus sales organizations. And in the last episode from last week, he talked about all of the ways you can get to problem identification in discovery, size up the problem, get agreement on the problem. And in this episode, we're gonna take it a step further where we start to talk about the ideal future state and ultimately go into the demo and next steps on your discovery call. Nick, why should people listen? So we got into a couple different really, really impactful things in your disco calls in this episode. First, we talked about why you should not be telling your prospect with a 100% conviction that you can absolutely solve their problem. Then we get into how to get your prospect to tell you exactly where they are looking to go and what you need to sell to in the demo. And then we got into some best practices for showing value, showing demo, including the exact questions that you should be asking after you've showed any particular feature. Alright, Katie. I hope that you've not forgotten that we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. First one is you have to discover the better feature. You can't just go deep on problems and pains. You actually feel like, what is the better future they are trying to achieve, right, in all this? What we're looking for here is, like, where do they want to go in all of this? What is it they actually want to do? So this is not what they want the product to do. This is what's on the other side of this. Right? So if we were able to solve this, what would that allow you to do? Where do you want to get to? What does success even look like? If you were to roll a product like this out, how do you know it went well? So we're trying to find out what is it they actually want in all of this? What is that better future they're trying to achieve? You can't just go on problems. Too many reps just go on for, like, I have enough pain to sell. Mm-mm. You gotta know where you're trying to go. Well, my better future is hearing number two. So what's that? Number two would I I say I gotta make them hold it. Make them hold it. Right? And get rid of, like, the the standard check-in questions. We call them BLCs and make them hold it questions, where once you're in the demo, a lot of times, reps ask questions like, does that make sense? Any questions? And you get nothing from that. Right? Whereas if you're asking questions, it's called BLC. So BLC stands for benefit laden question, where you're actually asking them the benefit of what you just showed them. Because now it's their words. If I ask you, so how much faster is that than what you're doing right now? Now it's your words versus me saying, this is so much faster than what you're doing right now. Or make them hold it questions, which is where you get the prospect to visualize the usage of your product. So you just showed them a dashboard. So what metrics would you put here? What campaign would you start with? How would you prioritize this? Who would you roll this out to first? You wanna ask questions that really get them to make them hold it. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Beautiful. Round us out. What's number three? Number three is when you are in the demo, you have to constantly be looping back to what they've told you now in discovery. If you're not gonna use what you learned in discovery, don't even do it. You might as well just run the demo. So the idea around looping is that we are connecting back feature by feature, function by function of, like, k. Here's what it's actually going to do for you. And the framework that we teach throughout the demo is, like, k pick. Here's what I know, the problem, the impact of that problem, connecting the dots to how we solve it, and then the call to action VLCs and make them hold questions. But we're constantly coming back to those things. Too often, demos, like, you might as well not even done the discovery because they're not even connecting back to what they learned in the first place. So that would be number three. Alrighty, Katie. So in the last episode, you broke down everything you need to do to start a discovery call, identify a problem, get your prospect to agree to that problem, and quantify the impact of that problem. And then there's a turn where you start to go into the better future of so let's talk about what you want it to look like. Mhmm. Could you give an example of what would you hear as a problem in a discovery call? And then how would you transition that Yeah. To a better future? So for finally so we are, you know, a platform for small businesses. We actually used to be called back office. So we handle all the accounting, payroll, bookkeeping, expense management. We have a corporate card, grow it into banking. So it's like all in in one. We can use, like, the expense management side of things. Right? So a common problem there, you have controllers chasing down receipts. Mhmm. Things aren't categorized properly. Salespeople, they always turn in their receipts on time. Hypothetically, let's say that they don't. Mhmm. So they can't match transactions. So that's a lot of the problems that happen there. And the impact of that problem, it takes longer to close the books. The books are not accurate. You're playing the bad guy chasing Armand, if you don't put your receipt in so, like, that's all of the problems of the impact of it or whatever. So generally from there, it's like, okay. Assuming we could solve that, now notice the seeding that we're doing there. Right? Like, so assuming we could solve that, I'm not telling you we can. I'm not saying, oh, we're gonna fix it, which is a lot of reps do. Mhmm. Oh, based on what I heard, like, we can solve all this for you. Okay. Well, assuming we could solve that for you, what would that look like for you? What if you didn't have to chase those things down? What would you do? How would you leverage that time? What would that allow you to do? What would change if it's still one of my favorite discovery questions. So assuming we could solve this, what would change if you could do these things, you didn't have to chase down? What would change if we were collecting all those things? Tell me a little bit more about that. This is a very important pivot is you've got all these problems. And also, by the way, y'all, this is huge. Because they've been sharing their problems with you, trust is much higher at this point, so it's way easier for them to share. Like, honestly, Katie, I just I don't wanna be working late every single weekend to try to get the books closed each and every single month. Or my CFO's breathing down my and back because, like, I can't answer for where our loan's expenses are and why there's a $1,400 charge at, like, you know, Papa Docs. It's like, what what does what does this even mean? You know? And so it's things like that. I'm like, where do you want this to go? It's not what do you want the product to do. That's not what this is about. This is what's on the other side of this. If we did fix this, what would change? If we do this and nothing changes in your world, you're not gonna change. Like, you there's no reason for you to do this. So that's the transition into the better future. And then similarly, just like in the problem, it would make my life so much easier. See, that's what I want, Nick. Tell me more. What does that mean? Same way, like, on the problem side where they're like, oh, yeah. I'm dealing with this. Okay. Tell me more. What does that mean? Same question. Now in the positives. Like, god. I just make my life so much easier. I could get the books done so much faster. Love that for you. Tell tell me more. What would that mean? Now we're unpacking the better future. You have this language of assuming we can solve that. I think a lot of times, the way that I know you're you're doing your discovery with your, like, sort of multiple choice, you're helping steer the conversation towards places you can help, like, you can solve all of that stuff. Mhmm. And so why are you almost, like, tempering that statement as opposed to being like, yeah. We can solve all of these. What would that mean for you? Because it doesn't matter if I say it. Doesn't matter if I tell you we can solve all those things. In fact, we are actually quite prone to look for disagreement more than agreement. So if I tell you, oh, we can solve all that, what it generally actually creates is a lens of, well, we'll see. Because if I say like, you know, assuming we could, we might be able to, it's possible. I'm actually pulling you in. Whereas now it's like, well, let's look to see if you can, not to see if you can't. And we gotta remember, every step, I'm trying to get to the next one. So if I say things like, you know, so assuming we could solve this, I'm not cornering you. I'm not pressuring you. In fact, I'm pulling you in and building some curiosity. Yeah. Assuming we can. No promises. What does that actually make you think? If you come to me and like, alright, Katie, you know, blah blah blah. We want you to, like, train, like, our our sales leaders. I was like, alright. Let's let's assume maybe, like, we can get your managers running a little bit tighter. As opposed to, oh my god. I've worked with the best of the best, and you're gonna love it. I'm the best trainer out there. It pushes people away. That's why. I like to be definitive when I actually know I'm definitive. I only actually know that once I've run the demo. I actually only know that once I've gotten benefit related checkings. I actually only know that once I've made you hold it because you've told me it's gonna solve this for you. So it's pulling them in. The on the science of selling is one of the one of the best that broke this down of either different push and pull language and how if you pull people in, like, we might be able to. It's actually possible. We'll see. We don't work for everyone. We'll we'll dive in here. It pulls people in more than when you're saying, hey. This is gonna be great for you. It pushes people away. So, Katie, could you talk about then the transition as you start to pull them in and you're like, assuming we could solve this, what would you want life afterwards to look like? They're like, yeah. I would I don't wanna do the books anymore. How do you start to transition to the solution without making them defensive? This is where we get to use the MMS might make sense to the transition now into either the demo or the next call depending if you do a little bit. Now I will throw this out as a tip y'all. Like, if your disco call, demo call separate, you gotta give them a taste. You gotta give them a little little taste in that call. So the the segue this transition here is very similar. So once we've gone through this, this is what sets up the might make sense. You know? Actually, Nick, I think think this might make sense. Here's what I'm hearing. The books are taking too long. Chasing down receipts. You're tired of playing the bad guys. CFOs breathing down your your neck. And, really, you wanna get to a place where you you feel confident in these things. You're not working as many hours. I mean, we've solved that for a lot of people. What I'd love to do is walk you through how we might be able to solve that for you. And if you like what you see, talk about getting in the rest of your finance team on the next call because that's generally how this works. Would that sound okay? Now the reason for the next step is what we just talked about. I'm seeding the very next thing. If you like what you see today, we'll talk about getting your next people on. I can't remember the the technical term, but what it does is it also takes the pressure off that I'm not asking you to buy today, which allows you also to listen better because they're like, oh, man. They're gonna it's like, no. I already know. We gotta talk to other people. Don't worry about it. I want your opinion on this thing. So it's the might make sense. Here's what I know you're struggling with. Here's what I know you wanna get to. I don't think we might be able to do this for you, but it'll be up to you to tell me if we can. Let me walk you through this. And if you think it will solve it, we'll talk about getting the rest of your team on the next call. And if not, you can just let me know. You mentioned that on that thirty minute discovery call, it is a massive error to not give them at least a little taste of this thing. So my question for you is, thirty minute call, what's the minute mark where you make this transition? How much time do you allocate for sort of giving them that taste? And then how do you then transition into driving those next steps? I like twenty five and five. Like, if I'm giving actual time, but there's a little caveat here. It It has nothing to do with time. It has everything to do with information gathered. There are times where you have all the information you need in the first nine minutes of that call. You got good problems. You got impact of that problem. You got the better future they're trying to achieve. Like, you've got what you need. Sometimes Russell is like, well, we got thirty minutes today, so let me just keep drawing this out. I also too I think a lot of reps ask too many questions in discovery, which I know I think I talked about it on the the last episode a bit where it's like, keep some of your powder. I wanna ask you about the the receipt collection process in more detail when we get to the receipt collection process of the demo. Right? So I wanna save some of those things. So it's not so much time. Did I get what I need out of it? Once I know what that is, if I'm saying I'm doing, like, the thirty minute and whatever else so, Nick, obviously, we have ten minutes left here, but I would just feel awful not showing you anything today based off what you told me. Can I show you this receipt collection thing super quick? Like, we'll go deeper on the next call, but can I just I think you're gonna love this based off what you told? Can I show you that real quick before we do the next one? Whereas, like, now it's like me saying, like, hey. Like, I know we're I want can I show can I? I wanna show you this thing. So I'm showing them one key thing based off of what they told me their problem was. And I'm not going too deep in it. I'm just saying, like, I just want you to see this real quick. So I want you to imagine a world right here. Okay. Swipe the card. Boom. Transaction comes up. Arman's gonna get a text message in that moment saying, please take a picture of the receipt from, you know, Papa Deli's deli. So he pulls it out, takes the picture, boom, it's connected in there already, Todlak, and if he doesn't, he's gonna get a reminder in twenty four hours and another one forty eight hours, and guess what happens when he doesn't do it in forty eight hours? That card is shut off. He can't even spend until he does. So, like, now you're not the bad guy because the software is doing it, and, two, you made Arman's life easier. I mean, does this kind of look like what you may be hoping to see? Yeah. That was, I don't know, ninety seconds maybe. Maybe. But, like, it gives, like, a tease there. Right? Then that transitions to the last five minutes. Like, okay. So, like, let's get a full forty five minutes blocked later on this week. It may not take forty five. I like to block forty five, so I would never want you to feel rushed through this. I wanna make sure you can ask all the questions you need to ask to feel comfortable with this. I want you to make sure this can work for you. How does Thursday or Friday look? And then we go from there. Could you talk about end of the demo? How do you transition to next steps? And is it literally just you're going in for the next step, you're trying to multithread, etcetera? Are you doing anything to, like, first make sure that what you showed actually resonated? Well, so like I'm I'm showing the demo. So So one of the concepts in our big three, we're talking about looping. So each and everything, you have to loop back to one of the problems they told you and the better future they're looking for. So every single time, you're looping back, you're looping back. So if I'm showing that receipt thing, so I'm showing the receipts, that are going through all that. When I get to the end of showing that section, the whole time of it so, like, earlier you mentioned you're chasing down receipts for 14 different salespeople right now, and they're not getting them back to you, things like that. So let me walk you through this. You through that. So this will allow you to now actually do this, this, that, and the other. So a make them hold it question would be like so, you know, you can have all sorts of controls around, like, notifications and limits and locks around the receipts. How many reminders would you want to send before you lock out a cart? And that'd be a make them hold it question. And then it's like, okay. So now let's let's go there real quick. At the end of the month, you're getting all these receipts. They're already in there. How much faster do you think you'd be able to close the books if you already had the receipts instead of chasing them down? Oh, god. I could probably knock a day or two off just like that. That's what we're here to do. I noticed they said knock a day or two off, not me. They said they'd put, like, a two reminder in before it. And then one great one you can always ask, especially if it's around a problem with people, So who's your problem child? Who's the rep that never does it? Oh god. That's Jenny. That Jenny Jenny, I've I haven't seen received a receipt from Jenny in five years. Like, alright. Let's talk about Jenny today. Again, make it make them hold it is is the key here. So I'm going through this, and now what I'm collecting is they're telling me the benefits. They're telling me about this. So by the time I get to the end of the demo, the way we transition always, always, as we're talking about in the demo, like, make them want it. At the end, we confirm they want it. And this is whatever the next step normally is. So if that's pricing, if that's a POC, if that's a multi threading call, whatever it is, you say, so before we talk about getting Arman on a call, or before we even talk price, what do you think? Do you think this will solve x y z better than what you're doing right now? Because if not, price doesn't even matter. Because if not, getting Arman doesn't even matter. If you don't think so, what do you think? Do you think this will solve it for you? And your sellers, you have to get a hard yes here. A hard yes. A hard yes is. Yeah. Yes. A soft yes is. Yeah. I mean, I think so. Back the f up. They don't believe it. You have to back up or they'll hit you with a deflection When I say, well, I mean, it it depends on how much it costs. That's if you're buying. The price actually doesn't matter if whether you believe it will solve the problem for you. But normally, we don't ask the price for something that we don't think works. So does that mean you think it will solve it for you? Well, yeah. Right? So we pull it back. And then this is one of the most important things at this question. So what do you think? Does you think this will solve x y z for you a little bit better than what you're doing right now? I want you to catch the unsell in that. Not just do you think it'll solve it? Do you think you'll solve it better than what you're doing right now, trying to move you away? They say, yes. This is the question. Why? What stood out to you? That's really, really good. You sort of talked about, like, when they're waffling, where they're like, yeah. But how do you approach this in competitive scenarios? It's not always about, does your product solve the problem? It might solve it for them, but the competitor might solve it even better. And so I have to imagine sometimes people are like, yeah, but we're looking at a couple different options, and so I don't wanna, like, you know, plant my stake in the ground and say you are the best fit. I was just at an event, and I had the opportunity to chat with Erin Bates. She's the CRO over at Crossbeam. She said something at this table. I was like, how have I never thought about it this way before? And she's talking about competitive deals. And she says, part of our discovery process is we find out if this is an offensive demo or a defensive demo. We assume every demo is a competitive demo. We want to know if we're the first one or second, third one because it changes how we run the demo. Is this an offensive demo, meaning we're on offense, or is it on defense? Meaning, like, they're already talking to other people, so we are a little bit more on the defense. So we should have found this out earlier, first of all, of whether or not this is a competitive deal. Because if we know it's a competitive deal, you're covering this in the demo. You're not even letting it get to that point of, like, oh, but they do this x y z better. It's like, hey, so my assumption is if you're talking to me about leadership training, you might be talking to to Force or to Winning by Design, maybe Sassy as well. So I'll be sure to cover some differentiators throughout this process as well when we're going through all that. So that's one way. But if it's actually to that point in the demo where they're like, well, yeah, but it seems like they do it better. Interesting. Tell me more. How do they do it better? Now they're gonna start to sharing, like, what the actual better is. Because is it better or is it different? That also is a huge, like, nuance there. So if it's at this point, we should already have gotten ahead of it, but just, alright, cool. Tell me a little bit more. Is that a deal breaker? Because of all the other things that we do, is this the deal breaker? Is this the thing that makes or breaks the decision? We let people kill their own deals. We let prospects kill their own deals over things that didn't actually matter, but we never got them to kill the idea. Whereas, like, well, it doesn't really do x y z. Like, oh, is that a deal breaker? It can do everything else, but if it can't do that, that that's just a no go. Well, no. I'm just I would okay. So it's not a deal breaker. Right? Like, there's no perfect software in the world, but at least we know this is important and we can address that down the line. So of the things it does do, what is most important? Back to the priority. Katie, you said two things there that I think some people might perceive as contrarian viewpoints. The first one is you gave that example of, hey. I'm assuming if you're talking to me, you're probably talking to, and then you actually named some of your competitors. And I remember when I was a brand new salesperson, I got taught you never, never, never say your competitors by name. And so I'm curious to hear your perspective on that. Mhmm. And then I'm also curious to hear your perspective. I'm thinking about demo ordering in a bake off. There's two schools of thought. There's the you wanna go first so that you're on offense and setting the tone. But then there's also the, oh, there's the recency bias thing. You actually wanna go last because that's what they remember the most. I'm curious your thoughts on actually both of those somewhat separate topics. I always wanna go first. Always. Zero hesitation. Because it allows me to create the frame. It allows me to set the standard. It allows me to set the expectation. It also allows me to plant seeds of doubt. So I always want to go first. Always. Because one of my favorite things to do in competitive deals is give the prospect the list of questions to ask. So if you're gonna go talk to, you know, company Nick, be sure to ask x, y, and z and make sure they show you a, b, and c. What? Like, I've like, you're gonna talk? Make sure you ask and make sure they show. So notice, I didn't say we're better. I didn't say we can do things they can't do. Make sure you ask them this and make sure they show you. What do you think that does to the prospect? You're planting some seeds of doubt there already of like, woah. Right? Like and I I'd go so far to print this stuff out. I have gotten feedback from competitors in the past when we know when we're in a deal against you because they ask us the questions and we get stuck. No bigger compliment because I know what their weak spots are. So that's that side. On the naming of competitors, right, this truthfully, this varies if it's outbound or inbound. If it's inbound, I'm naming. You inbound, which means you were searching. So for me to not name is silly. You're probably out there looking. And two one of my favorite, tools in psychology and influence with language is the two c's, correct or confirm. So it's it's like as humans, like, we can't help but correct you or confirm that you're right. So if I say, so alright. So, like, you know, reach out to us. Now assuming you probably reached out to x, y, and z as well, Correct or confirm. Because if they didn't, guess what they'll say? Actually, no. Like, we've only reached out to to you. Oh. Mhmm. Perfect. Well, we just saved you a whole bunch of time or they'll confirm. Yeah. Like, we started reaching out. Yeah. I figured you gotta do your due diligence. It makes sense. I fear nothing in in this. Right? And that's the key, and that that is contagious. Right? When you're not afraid of something. I'm gonna make this easier for you. I'll be sure to cover the differences between us, the nuances between us, and I should probably give you some insights to bring to them to make sure you get the most out of those conversations as well. In fact, we actually have a cheat sheet I'll share with you afterwards. This is fun when you know what you're doing and, like, you lean into it. You're not afraid of it. So I always wanna go first, and I will name drop because to not is to me shows fear. It shows, like, I'm afraid that, oh, if I say them, they're gonna go look for them. No. Like and I hope that they do. Like, go look because you're about to have the best experience you've had with the seller with me. I don't care. Well, it's no different than the way that in the beginning of the discovery call, you are offering the options of the problems that you think they're dealing with. Because they're either going to confirm, yep. We're dealing with those two over there, or they're going to correct you and say, it's actually not that. It's this. Weird. Yeah. You also look better than being like, so what are your top pain points? Right. Like, what is your biggest challenge right now? The classic, what keeps you up at night? For any one person, like and I when I say, like, single digits, I mean single digits I can think of across the thousands and thousands of disco calls I've run and listened to where, like, the bucket question, when is a good one, but it's wrong. And the person goes, no. I'm not dealing with any of that. No. Try again. Right? Now if you're a real seller in that situation, you've got three more ready. Like, oh, dang. So if you're not dealing with that, I mean, are you doing x, y, and z? There you go. You got it. The suggestions make it easier. It's more natural. You get correct and confirm. You get the authority bias built in as well. You know what you're talking about, and that weaves through everywhere in the demo. Everywhere. Right? That's why even too, like, price that I I want to say the realness. That's why I like with the do you want it? Price doesn't matter if you don't want it. Literally, it could be free. Doesn't does not matter if you don't want it. That's 100% true. It's better to be completely honest. It doesn't even matter to pull Armana because if you don't like it, Arm like Nick, doesn't matter if Armana likes it. You don't like it. So it doesn't even matter. You can tell me first. Right? But now I have buy it. Once I know you want this and why. Everything that comes next is to help you get what you want. You told me you want this. Yeah. I should do this will make my life so much easier. That receipt thing, like, god. Like, I wish I had that. Say, alright. Love it. I just wanted to make sure. So the best way to make this happen for you is if we can get Arman on a call to make sure he sees the same way we do. How can we make that happen? Notice the difference in that question. The best way to get this for you and to make your life better is that we can get our mom on a call to make sure that he sees it the way that we do. When can we make that happen? Now it's about getting that boss is not about going above the person. It's not about by stepping the person, like, this is how to get you what you want. And if we don't get them on our side, you miss out. You don't get this. How can we make that happen? That's how we get to step into the next steps. The next best step is to get legal involved. The next best step is to do a proof of concept. The next best step is to do a custom proposal. The best way to get you what you want is to do this, including, if you're in super transactional, starting today. So the best way to get this going is we get you started today. Could I make a recommendation on which package I think you should go with? Because if we get off the call today without taking action, what's gonna happen, Nick? What's gonna happen? If what the moment you get off this call, what's gonna happen? Be buyer's remorse or decision remorse. They're gonna disappear. They're gonna get busy. Right. And I like, we say that type of stuff of, like, if we don't take action today, what I'm afraid of is you're gonna step back into the world. You're gonna be chasing down receipts again. You're gonna be hunting down Jenny because she never sends it in. You're You're gonna be in meetings with your CFO, Armand, trying to figure out the books, and you're gonna get back into the mess. If we can get you going today, we can start to solve that for you today. Can we get you moving? Right? So, again, completely honest. Everything I said there is true. Everything I said there is true. If we don't take action today, I am worried. I never hear from you again. Not because you don't care, but because you're busy. Right? Each one of those things sets up whatever that next step is is to help them get what they want. Katie, this has been another phenomenal episode. The clock is ticking. We gotta move to the last question, which is talked about good things sellers should be doing. Now we gotta talk about one bad thing. So the last question is, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? It's just not asking the real question. You know? They don't ask the question behind the question. That's where I spend time. Is what's the question behind the question? So if you're asking so walk me through your email process right now. You're hoping you hear a problem in that question. What's the question behind the question? What are you actually trying to find out? Ask that question. Just go there. Stop trying to hear the problem in the answer. Ask the problem question. That would be my biggest. Right? What's the question behind this? Like, what do you think? What what is that question? What's the question behind the question? It's like, do you want this? That's the real question in there. That would be the one I would say. Ask the question behind the question. Stop asking these questions up here that don't do anything for you. Amazing. KD, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with KD. What do you have for your tube? Number one is your framework for exactly what to say anytime you are showing a feature in a demo. It is k pick plus make them hold it. So what you're gonna do is as you show a feature, you're going to explain what you know about their current situation and the problems that that situation is causing and then the impact of those problems. Then you're going to connect the dots as it relates to how your solution or that feature makes those problems go away. And then you're gonna ask them to HOLD that feature. Okay. So I've just shown you these dashboards. I guess, what would some of the main analytics you would put on your home screen be? Make them visualize what it would be like to actually use your product. Number two is, assuming we can solve this, what would that mean? And so what you're doing is when you're talking with your prospect, you should never come in with 100% conviction and bravado that you can absolutely make their problem go away. Because when you do that, they're going to have to be skeptical. Otherwise, they're just letting themselves be sold by a salesperson who, of course, they think their thing is going to solve their problem. So instead, to tee up the demo, what you wanna do is you wanna say, okay. So assuming we can solve some of these brand perception issues, I guess, what would that actually look like? How would the quality of your conversations with prospects change? And now what you're doing is you're saying, hey. Assuming we make this problem go away, because I think we might, but let's actually validate that. How would that change the goal, the future state that I know you're looking to have? And now you get them visualizing where they're looking to go, and they're no longer skeptical about, well, is this solution actually a right or not? Now you're on the same side of the table in the demo. Number three. Best way to make them hold it during a demo is to ask them, alright. Who's your problem child? Oh, okay. It's Nick who never actually submits the correct receipts. So let's just pretend that Nick is the one who's submitting a receipt right here. Here's what that looks like. Put the people in the organization into the demo. And then lastly, number four, once you get ready to set next steps, always set next steps and multithread in their best interest. That sounds like okay. So the best way to solve this for you is for us to get Jane on board with the way that we see things here. How do we get her involved? Notice, we're not saying the best way for us to close this deal is to get to your boss. The best way to solve this problem for you is to make sure that Jane sees it the same way that we see things. That gets you on the same side. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here? So, folks, if you didn't catch on, this whole month was 30. And the reason that we are doing this very special month is we recently released the 30 MPC Discovery Course, where we codified all of the best practices that Armand and I have learned, interviewing over 250 top performers in sales into an extremely easy to follow step by step framework that teaches you what to do, what to say, and how to sound in every single piece of your discovery call. If you wanna check that out, there is a link in the show notes to do so. It would warm my heart if you would. But otherwise, we will see you next week on thirty minutes to Presidents Club.
