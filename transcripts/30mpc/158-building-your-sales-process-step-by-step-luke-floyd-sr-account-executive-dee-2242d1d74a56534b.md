## Transcript

Good morning everybody and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have a senior AE over at deal. His name is Luke Floyd, and he's one of the most process oriented sellers we've ever had on the show. Nick, why should people listen? Well, Arman, if you don't know where you wanna end up, it's really hard to figure out which direction to go in. And Luke is masterful at building out his deal process from day zero all the way, not just to deal closed, but to customer having a successful project. And what that allows him to do is start to templatize different elements of his sales process and really plan how to be strategic in every single discrete interaction. And so if you want to figure out how to have an extremely, extremely clear view of how to win each and every deal, you may consider listening to this episode. And you may also consider looking at the show notes because Luke was kind enough to actually send all of the templates that he uses to drive his deals forward, including a recap email, a group recap email, and even a template you can send after you lose a deal to your prospects. And so you can download all of those in the show notes and a three, a two, a one. Let's get to the show. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, Luke. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Absolutely. Thanks so much for having me. Number one, build your own sales process. Your steps in your CRM are just not the same thing as understanding your sales process. Establishing your process by writing down step for step, literally every call, every action, every follow-up email, every LinkedIn touch that's going to happen in your ideal sales process will allow you to gradually increase the value of those touches by templatizing and automating those resources and then incrementally building their value over time. And you also need to know where you're going. So if you don't write it down and know it for yourself, you certainly can't lead your prospect through the process. Beautiful. What's number two? Number two is establishing your carrying capacity. So I see sellers with a ton of quota anxiety, especially around new roles. I know we're at the top of the year, folks starting new. Normally, you have quota anxiety because there's no benchmark for what you're capable of. Once you have your process established from above, you can understand how your clients and how many you can carry in at the same time. That's your personal carrying capacity. So depending on your segment, you might have one client that that's all you can show up for. You might have a 100 you need to balance with SMB. But how well you show up for your client is really a function of how thin your spread. And as you know, the space right now with the economic climate, you really have to do extra work to show off who you are to get results. Beautiful. Round us out, Luke. What's number three? Yeah. So number three is building consensus through messaging. So So attention is more fragmented than ever. Reviewing the top project priorities at the beginning of each call and the start of the recaps, getting feedback on them, socializing them allows the project to be more aligned and smooth internally. So there's no surprises, and everyone looks good for their win. So the way I do this is I write and summarize in bullet points in my recap email what I heard as their key priorities. Couple of the things you might wanna remember for rules of consumption. Rules of three, easy to remember. Emotions are also tied to things like that. So if you put some emotion in those words, it helps. And then finally, consensus comes from how people feel, and consensus is what sells when you're not in the room. So it's all about how people feel, not what they know about your solution. So, Luke, I wanna talk about first laying out your sales process, and maybe we can use deal as an example. And then let's talk about you mentioned you have templates for different parts of your sales process. Once you've laid it out, let's talk about afterwards what those templates are. Yeah. Absolutely. So just for context, Deal is a platform that helps teams hire, pay, and manage anyone, anywhere globally. So I work with global teams. I typically sell into the HR, finance, legal, and talent functions, basically the back office. And this is, basically an action that I recently took, after working with my sales coach. I really sat down and thought about what is my ideal sales process. Now you can do this across multiple because you might have multiple different ways to sell. But I sat down and said, okay. What's my ideal way to sell? It starts with whether it's inbound, whether it's outbound, whatever it might be. Ideally, we wanna start with an account plan, so we can do our research. Where's my template for my account plan details? What research am I gathering? Then you eventually needed to do some cold outreach or some outreach introduction, whatever it is you need to break open the account. So that's where you're writing down all your messaging, but it really starts with the discovery call or whatever that first call, whatever you call it, qualification, whatever it might be. From there, I already have my templates. I personally use Dooly. I have my templates saved, and I have different templates based on the type of call. So key things that I know I'm going to need to get out of the call, I start with my agenda in my template, literally word for word, what I need to say, the next steps. So that way you don't have to rely on your brain to pull through when you're maybe a little frazzled in the call. Once I'm done with that discovery qualification call, we're obviously trying to figure out who to go to next. So I need to do some kind of recap email. And this recap email already have a template. At the top of the template, it has bullet points of their three priorities. It has the links to the Gong recording. It has all the follow-up details and one pagers and MSAs and all that good stuff. But the biggest thing and why it's up top are those three priorities. So it looks something like, it sounds like we should continue the conversation. It's worth time continuing the conversation because your priorities are it might be you know, they really care about employee experience or cost savings are their priority right now or operational efficiency or compliance. We have a number of value props we sell to. But, basically, I'm trying to align what are the value props that I have that I know I can push, and what are their priorities, and how do those two things line up? That allows them then if they forward that email over to, let's say, it's the HR manager I'm speaking with, and they forward it over to somebody in finance, I can get finances take when we start that next follow-up stakeholder disco demo call. So we start with a qualification call. That's typically thirty minutes. We then move into a stakeholder discovery demo call, which is usually an hour, light demo that has been customized based on the initial qualification details. And I'm kicking off that call the same way. Agenda, introductions, and then here are the priorities I've heard so far. And then that allows me to say, what do you think? What's your experience with finance? Are these the same priorities your team has? And then we go through that call. At the end of that call, if there are multiple folks on it, I'm sending out individual emails, as well as a group recap email. Got templates for all of those. And then also establishing next steps. Again, because I wrote the process out, I know the next step I want them to get to. So then it's just a matter of telling them, hey, this is where we need to go, or do you have another suggestion? Right? So that's in my mind, the leadership through the sales process. Once we get done with the, you know, stakeholder disco demo, we'll probably have to do some kind of proposal or pricing review that's basically a business case review of the business case I put together. In more complex deals, I might even be having champion calls in between here to build that business case. But at some point, that business case is built, and then we're ready to start introducing to the executives, review that, review the pricing and proposal. Have a template for the business case, as you might imagine, as well as internal templates they can use, including even being able to put it into non branded or lightly branded things that they could easily pull slide data, for example, and make it look like their own work. And then after that, we get into the legal and procurement process. In my mind, this is where you can tell how efficient you are as a salesperson or how intentional you are by how easily your teams get through your clients get through these processes. So legal, especially in what I do can be a big hurdle because there's a lot of compliance risk and divvying up that risk. So prepping my clients for, hey, this is what I typically see people do in the legal review. Here are some things you might wanna know. We even have a guide that walks them through the MSA so their team can be aware of why we have written the way it's written. It's very specific and not like a ton of other software companies' MSAs. And then, obviously, hopefully, we're getting into onboarding and pilot, proof of concept, whatever you wanna call it. So for that proof of concept, I already have a pilot deck written out, already have my pilot plans, the things I'm gonna need for those plans if we're gonna do a pilot or proof of concept with them. And then once that's successful, we get the full launch. This is where you're able to do things like employee communications materials. Each one of those items then I have templates for, and that's the baseline getting the templates. Because once you have them all templatized, now you can go back and figure out how can I be even more valuable? Where am I sounding like a salesperson? How do I improve this? That's my way of walking through and understanding my process and then incrementally improving it. This is fascinating. So just to play it back for the audience, you have the following steps that I wrote down. The first is a qualification slash discovery call, and that is ended with a recap email. The second is you have a multithreaded stakeholder call oftentimes going over a demo, and then you have a group recap email. Then you have a business case that you're building, and you have a business case template with that. Then you have procurement, and you have explicit descriptor language you always use on how the MSA is structured. MSA is the master subscription agreement. And then you have your POC, and you have a pilot deck with your POC. And then when you do full launch, you have employee comms and whatnot. And so you're taking all these transitions at these different transitionary points within your sales process, and you have templates that keep pushing that deal forward. Right? Can you talk about at the end of that first qualification call, right, what does it look like to wrap that call up? Yeah. Absolutely. Great question. So, typically, it's like, hey, Nick. I'm recognize we have five minutes left on the call. This sounds like it could be valuable and worth additional time. What do you think? They say yes. I say, okay. Well, typically, from my side, when I work with clients, my most successful clients will involve their finance, HR, and legal teams. Your HR, so we already got you covered. Who from finance do we need to bring on the next call? Because it's really gonna impact their day to day. And part of what's effective about what you've done is because you have mapped out your entire sale from start to finish, step by step, and you've figured out all of the roles that need to be involved with each of those steps, you are actually qualified to make that recommendation for them. It's really hard to just pull a next step out of your pocket if you've not done what you talked about, which is the exercise of saying, here's the brain dump of all the things I could do and probably should do when someone's evaluating my product or service. If you've not done that, it's really hard to just figure stuff out. Question for you. What do you do when they disagree with that suggestion of, well, you know what? We probably don't need finance involved in this. How do you do you suss that out and say, wait. That seems wrong. Do you accept it at face value? What's your approach? Yeah. No. Absolutely. That's actually where the fun begins because ideally, they do have thoughts and opinions, and I'm not leading the whole thing. So if they say, no. Actually, we don't need finance. Or they might say, well, actually, I'm just gonna take it back to our team and let me see if it's worth a call. Right? That tells me everything I need to know. You can't change people in sales. All we can do is react based on where they're at and derisk based on where they're at. So from there, I'm hearing, maybe they didn't get enough value. Maybe they don't trust me enough. Maybe I came off too sales, and they don't wanna introduce a salesperson to their colleagues. So this is an area where I try to say, okay. Well, typically, my other clients are having finance come on because, like, we're doing expense approvals and, like, mass payments and uploading ACH payment methods. Is that something your HR team handles? I mean, everybody does it different. I like that. So you're giving justification for your ask there. I actually wanna ask you something, Lou, because I've heard you use this sort of phrase a couple times where you're evaluating your messaging to make sure you're not sounding salesy. You're recognizing that if you sound too salesy, they might push back and say, hold up. I don't want you to meet the team. Are there things that you're consciously doing or consciously looking for in your messaging to say, hey. Wait. I probably need to change that because it sounds too salesy? Yes. So the specific things I'm looking for, I actually just had a call yesterday where a prospect came on. He started off the call by saying, I've talked to these other vendors. I wasn't crazy about it. How are you different? And I said, look. To be transparent, I'm not gonna tell you how they're bad because they're probably the right fit for some clients. Why don't we talk about why our clients choose us instead of them? And then we went into that. So number one, never bad mouth your competition. Unless you are specifically asked to do a bake off or side by side comparison on a feature set and you need to get into the weeds, your competition's also making money. They're they're also a fit for somebody no matter what we wanna think about how evil they might be. Right? So don't bad mouth your competition, number one. Number two, it's about the project. It's not about the sale. Anything worth doing these days in corporate America that's worth, we'll say, 50 k or above is going to have a project behind it, especially in this economic climate. You're not just spending willy nilly. So what that tells me is there's somebody making a decision. There's somebody that can step in and involve the decision, but there's also multiple decision criteria at play that I need to iron out. And and so if I'm focused on the project and give them advice on the project, like, hey. Even if you don't move forward with deal, as you're talking to these other vendors, because you said you're gonna talk to some of the competition, that's great. I'll even tell them the competitors to look at. I'll say, who have you looked at? Oh, that company, you kinda, That's not really in the same ballpark. I'm not sure why you're talking with them. Or, actually, if you like deal, you should look at these other vendors. Because at the end of the day, I know I can solve their problem better than anyone else can because I have done it a lot, and I have clients that can say that. So I want to look like I only care about their project and their project success because I do. Because I have also learned that this is a very cyclical environment. It comes back around. You know, I have closed loss that come back around in three months or six months. It's not like a year subscription that you gotta wait until the renewal's up. And so in that world, showing them that you care about the project allows you to come in, let's say, sixty days later when onboarding is typically having problems and say, hey. How's the project going? You know, I just was really invested in making sure it was successful. Oh, and by the way, I know y'all aren't using us. What are the gaps do you still have? You need any salary benchmarks? Do you need any compliance details? Like, how can I be helpful? Because I'm here for the project, not for deal or myself or my commission. The second you start doing that, you actually start building champions. Luke, I love what you're doing because what a lot of people do when they get pressured on competitors is they'll either feature dump about how the best in the world or they'll throw mud at their competition. But what you're doing is you're doing discovery upfront, and you're figuring out what's important to them. And then my guess is you're then saying, hey. For these types of customers in these situations, here's where we are the perfect fit, and here's where we're not. And, ideally, you've done a good enough job in discovery such that you know that they fit in that mold of that type of customer. Can you give a couple of examples, and if you want, you can use deal, of how do you describe the situations in which deal is most effective in a way that sort of lays landmines for competition without you sounding like you're throwing mud or without you sounding like deal is the best company in the world. Yeah. I'll I'll give you a great example. So this prospective client I was speaking with yesterday, he came in and said, look. We're wanting to expand into Eastern Europe, and we wanna find tech talent in Eastern Europe. Our current vendor is not getting it done. How are y'all different? And so I said, hey. This is how, you know, this is why clients choose us. And I said, just one thing you might not even be thinking about. How do y'all feel about using contractors? Do you work with contractors currently? Talk about landmines. I know not all my competitors can support contractors, but we can. And Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, the workers will make more money as contractors because they get taxed less as contractors than as employees. So it's very popular. And if you're a tech company without a contracting option, you can lose talent because you don't have the ability to contract them. So this is why I said that. I said, are you sure? Like, you've gotta retain that contracting ability because the tech talent you're looking at so I already know more about the tech talent he's searching for than he does. Right? So I can tell him what that tech talent needs and then align that with our unique differentiators. So that's an example of one area. Another area where I've kind of stood my ground and said, actually, you don't wanna use this in that way. A prospective client, now a client, came in and was asking us to do something that we technically probably could have, but it wasn't really our sweet spot. And I didn't wanna burn this logo, enterprise EdTech logo, on a work around or kind of a fringe use case. And I had just gotten done working with another EdTech company. I know I sound very confident and very decisive. That's only because I have previously done the work or had the success to feel that way. So don't think it's just you can roll in arrogant and do it. And so I suggested to this VP. I said, actually, you're in the wrong spot. That's not really what you want us to do for you. Let me tell you what you actually want us to do for you. And I told them about the success we had had with a similar company. They immediately put the RFP on pause that they were looking for, went with us, picked that up, and then they picked up the RFP a year later. So by just standing my ground, knowing what I'm good at, knowing what I'm not good at, me being the business and the outcomes I can deliver, I'm, again, able to shepherd the project. If I'm a VP, do I really wanna waste my time working with somebody that's not a good fit? No. So why would I disrespect that VP by wasting her time that way? Luke, at what point did you decide to push that person away? Because I can see I'm thinking about that call where you're sort of getting some signs from this person that, like, they're looking for something that they shouldn't even be looking for in the first place. And I imagine after two or three sentences, you could say, no. You shouldn't do that. You're thinking about that wrong. But my guess is you did a little bit more discovery. So, like, at what point do you actually pull the trigger on pushing away? Yeah. So in that particular conversation, it had a lot to do with derisking my odds of losing. And so what I mean by that is if you're gonna lose, you wanna lose early. You don't wanna play out a cycle where you have a 50% chance to win. That just makes no sense in my mind. So instead, I listened to what her other priorities were. So what's your relationship like with your existing vendor? They don't move fast enough. You know, they they don't have tech enabled interface. Oh, so it sounds like you really prioritize speed and experience. Okay. Great. So then I'm turning around and flipping that in because there's no point in me talking about, hey. We did this for this other client. She might not even want that. I might have assumed that that's what they wanted. So, yeah, to your point, you have to do some discovery before you can qualify out. But I've almost never regretted qualifying out because it usually makes them pull closer. And it also shows that, I think, more importantly, back to the not salesy thing, I'm telling her, no. I don't I don't really wanna do that thing. Maybe we'll do this other thing, but that's not really where we shine. That's not what most salespeople do, so you stand out. It's really interesting what you say. I read a book recently where it talked about oftentimes before having any sort of confrontation with the buyer, like pushing back on them or asking them a very hard or direct question. Salespeople have the tendency to want to build rapport with the customer before they do that hard thing. When in reality, the hard thing, the direct ask or pushing them away is what actually builds rapport because they say, woah. This person is not just seeking out the sale. They they have my success in mind. So, Luke, one of the things you talked about earlier was you're getting these top three priorities and you're including it in that recap email. And then with every single stakeholder you meet with, you're going over those top three priorities again. And my question is different stakeholders at the organization are going to have different priorities. And so I might meet with the head of demand gen, and they've got a list of three priorities. And then I meet with the head of content and thought leadership, and they have different priorities, do I turn it into a list of six? Do I, like, boot out one person's priorities, and then they're mad at me down the line? Like, how am I summing all of this stuff up so that I don't get myself discombobulated? Yeah. So I I wanna be clear about what I'm what I specifically mean when I say priorities. I mean, the business values that they are pushing towards. Now, yeah, some businesses might have six values they're pushing towards. But usually, like, especially in our space and tech, almost everybody cares about cost savings, getting it done faster, like, those kind of things. And then where they're at as a disposition, buying disposition, if you go back to the Hyman Miller stuff, that'll tell you kind of where they're at in their buying mode. So that's the way that I think of priorities. The individual decision criteria, the individual pain points, that all gets documented for the business case. And I from that, they say, oh, actually, I don't care about that. Great. Let me go into, you know, take off screen share on my slide deck. Go into the deck. Okay. What are we gonna add to where we missed? And now we're collaborating on building the business case together. Because I just take all that stuff we got in our deck, put it in a business case, and run it by it. Right? So that's basically the way that I'm doing it. I hope that there's contention about what the priorities are. Because that tells me I also have somewhere I can insert myself. Because anywhere there's friction, I can help tamp down that friction to get the project moving. Luke, one thing that to double down on Nick's point that I worry about is you send this recap email, and I might have someone whose personal priorities as a people ops analyst, for example, might be super operational and in the weeds. And going into that stakeholder demo call or even in that business case review, those priorities might get to someone higher up, and they might squash this thing earlier. So if you get the sense that your champion is gonna start running this by other people internally, how do you coach them on how to speak to higher level business priorities and not just their problem? Yeah. That's a that's a great question. Frankly, this is an area that I could actually probably be a better salesperson, asking second and third level questions and implicating pain. What I do right now is try to understand what's the business working on. And it actually has more to do with how you set up your calls than the questions you ask. So we get a lot of inbound leads at deal. I'd ask what brought you to the conversation today. That immediately gets you into the weeds. So instead, I started my calls with an agenda and then saying, tell me about the role that you do it. I can read LinkedIn. I know you do x, but I work with other companies that are 200 to 2,000 employees, and a director of HR might do a lot of different things. I'm telling them about me. I'm telling them I've read about them. So that's the way that I try to kinda contextualize and set the table. Once the table is set, the email that I send over, let's say that the, you know, the accounting manager really cares about administrative burden because they're having to spend a week of their month every month getting their contractors paid. The CFO probably doesn't care about administrative burden, right, to your point. So the priorities are never framed in a way that anybody could object to them. Right? So what I mean by that is if I'm putting in operational efficiency, in the follow-up, I'm saying you're having problems with the payment, but that could affect in a long term via x y z. So the other thing is I'm not framing their priorities as their priorities. When I say their priorities, I mean the business priorities. Because the accounting manager's gonna know this is a me thing. Yeah. It affects my job, but, like, the business probably doesn't care more broadly. And they can tell you where that line is. You know? We don't have to figure all that out for ourselves. So the priorities that I'm recapping, I specifically call out their business and why our business is a fit. What you're doing is a lot of times sellers will get themselves in trouble because they'll put proposals out there or slide decks out there that are either too fill in the blank ee or without the proper voice over can be totally misconstrued. And what you're doing is you're taking the what you learn in discovery from them, and even if their priorities are, quote, unquote, lower priority in the organization, you are attaching those to the business priority so you are preserving the intent of the message that you have. Luke, what I'd love to do is would you actually be open to in the show notes, could we share a couple of these? I I think you have, like, a recap email and then a group recap email. Could we share both of those with the audience in the show notes after this? Yeah. Absolutely. I'll send over both of those as well as I have a, lost reply, like, whenever I get, like, a a lost email that's really instructive on how I keep the relationship open even after I get a no. Are there tools that you're using beyond some of the, like, the big obvious ones, like your sales engagement platform or your call recording tool that you're leaning on heavily to make your yourself a more effective seller? Yeah. Absolutely. So number one, Google alerts. So this is a whole thing, obviously, with accounts. Right? And that goes into my whole account planning process. But you should be you should be setting Google alerts for all your accounts. More than your accounts, you should be setting it for the key topics that you know about or should know about. So what are the key topics that your buyers are going to be concerned about? Number two, industry magazines, industry periodicals, podcasts. When I came to deal, I had never sold into HR finance, the back office. I'd always sold that either farmers or or salespeople. I know really broad. So I had to learn what HR cared about. Had no idea. So I just started listening to podcasts, reading newsletters. That's been really effective for me. And it also allows me we have an internal channel, a Slack channel called market news where I can post updates. Third, I have a tool called TweetDeck, which is free. If you have a Twitter account, obviously, Twitter's a bit of a dumpster fire lately, but it's still good for Intel. And so that's the whole way I use it. TweetDeck is the best way to think about it is, like, you have multiple feeds on one screen. So I can do a feed of my home page, or I could do a feed of everybody that mentions at deal. I found this when I was in CRM sales. Right? Somebody tags their CRM saying, hey. You suck. The CRM's out. As a salesperson, I was sliding in the DMs. Hey. I could get you up and running in a month. Right? Let's do this. Now I use it more for market awareness, industry awareness. Competitors announce their new products on Twitter. Right? So I can be the first one to know in the company often who's doing what, what the new hires are, all these details. But on top of that, I can then also track my prospect accounts, my prospects themselves, and Twitter lists as well. So Twitter is all about intel gathering, and that's no different than, like, LinkedIn sales nav. You should be setting up those lists using all that good stuff. A couple of other ones, Loom. Use Loom heavily. I fundamentally believe that it's okay to sometimes send over something with a Loom that would have otherwise required a meeting. And the reason why is because I believe in building value. My clients are very busy. A thirty minutes on the calendar with me sometimes just isn't reasonable. So I can either get rejected or I can build value by walking them through the thing with the Woom. The other thing I use is Dooly. Obviously, we already talked about that. I also use auto text expander, which is a Chrome extension. I use this very heavily. So as y'all know, if you've ever done any social selling, LinkedIn isn't exactly easy to automate or integrate. Right? So in the early days of social selling back in 2016 when I wrote a book about it or something, I would basically have all these different initial outreaches ready. So all I would have to put in is, like, the at symbol and the letter c, and it would pop in my, like, controller, you know, LinkedIn invite. That's a good example. Or, like, my Chili Piper link. I can easily drop that in, whatever it might be. Dang. I've got a whole list of new apps to go download, so this was great. And I guess I'm gonna have to do it now because we're running out of time. And we gotta move to the final question, Luke. The final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I'm gonna ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Yeah. So it's actually the the two edged sword of what I've been talking about. A lot of what I do is try to bring value to my client. I try to take my experience and build inference around it that might be applicable to them. But there's a very fine line between inferring and assuming. Assumption is the worst thing a salesperson can do, and it has come back to bite me. I am just as guilty of it. So assumption really and and and inference are, unfortunately, the curse of experience. You know, I've seen this a couple times. I've been through it. You can go and say, no. This is the way it has to be done, or you can approach it with curiosity like we talked about next steps. Hey. I've done it this way before. Maybe you have a different way of doing it. The beauty of our craft really is that it's a human profession. So there's always a wrench to throw in the works. So you just gotta be able to take a breath, ask a question before you assume. I have to, again, remind myself, especially in things like budget, who's holding the budget, all those things. I feel like we could always go deeper as sellers. That all just starts with being curious and not assuming. Even if you've seen the same play over and over and over again, and you think you know how it's gonna go, the wrong way to harness that experience is to assume. The right way is to inform and tell them why you're informing them of that. Beautiful. Luke, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Luke Floyd include, number one, build your sales process out step by step, and that will fuel how you ask for next steps at the end of every call. And it will also fuel our second takeaway, which is build templates for every part of your sales process once you have it built out. For example, you can have a discovery recap email, a group demo recap email, and you can even have a lost deal email at the end. And by the way, again, you can get all three of those in the show notes. And takeaway number three is once you finish that first discovery call and throughout the process, continue to recap the top three priorities. And if they end up sounding like below the line priorities or technical priorities, always recap those priorities in terms of the business problem, not in terms of that person's problem. And then lastly, number four, include rider language alongside your MSA to speed up the legal process at the end so that lawyers don't freak out when they read certain terms that are unique to your business. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Well, just like Luke mapped out his sales process step by step for you audience, I've got a step by step guide to steal Luke's templates.
