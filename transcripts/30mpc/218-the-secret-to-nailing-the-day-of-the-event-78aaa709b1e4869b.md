## Transcript

What's going on, folks? We're talking trade shows, events, in person conferences today, and these are extremely high potential, high opportunity things, and a lot of salespeople make total and utter waste of trade shows and conferences and what they spend their time doing at those things. So today, I'm talking about my big three to make sure that you get the most juice for your squeeze from in person conferences. Let us roll the tape. Number one is you want to avoid any and all non selling time. I see a ton of salespeople show up, they get on an airplane and fly to Dallas and they go to this conference center and then they spend four or five five hours of the week on internal team meetings on Zoom. You've got to prioritize in person meetings when you are at these in person events. And so clear off any internal non selling meetings that are on your calendar. Get them recorded. Get them rescheduled. Don't do them if they are not essential to keeping the lights on for your business. So get those off of your calendar. But you're also going to have other distractions that are non selling time at these events. One of the most dangerous is actually your own team. It can be tough because you've gotten on an airplane and you might see reps from other territories that you only see two or three times a year. And don't get me wrong, there absolutely needs to be team time at these events. You don't want to be like the lone wolf who's totally ignoring your colleagues. But you've got to make it clear with the team. Hey. The number one priority for me when I'm at this thing is I'm trying to make it to president's club. I want to meet with as many prospects as possible. And so I want to spend time with my team. We should go do some things, but it can't get in the way of meeting with prospects or making efforts to go meet with prospects. That's the reality of working in sales. There's certainly time for team bonding, but can't get in the way of prospecting. The last non selling activity that's almost even more dangerous is when you get stuck in those long conversations with prospects that aren't really prospects. Maybe they're not a good fit for what you sell. Maybe they're not in your territory and a different rep needs to be having a conversation with them. What you don't want to do is go to a networking happy hour and spend forty five minutes stuck in conversation to someone that, like, you can't or shouldn't be selling to. And so the best tip I ever learned to gracefully exit bad fit conversations, I actually learned from John Barrows. And what John taught me was when you're trying to exit one of these conversations, it's kind of rude to just be like, Yeah. I need to go or I'm gonna go to the bathroom and, like, leave because then they're gonna try to talk to you again. And so what you should do, what John taught me is you say, hey, you know, I'm sure you're like me at this event and you wanna meet with as many people as possible. I'm really on the hunt to talk to as many marketing leaders at sales tech companies as possible. And so if you see any of those folks, would you would you be open to pointing them out for me? By by the way, what type of person are you here to meet with? I wanna make sure I'm looking out for you too. And what you've done is you've communicated, hey. I'm I'm here to meet a lot of people just like you. This is who I'm looking for. Now you can get this person helping you out. But then you make it reciprocal by saying, hey, who are you here to meet? How can I help you out? And that's the best way to gracefully exit a not great fit conversation. The next theme here, tip number two is do not wait for prospects to come to you. You've got to go seek them out. Most salespeople, they show up at these things and they sit at the booth with their hands in their pockets and they're on their phone or their laptop and they're waiting for prospects to come to them. And that is the equivalent of you just sitting at your computer waiting for inbound leads to come to you. If that's the type of salesperson you wanna be, you probably aren't even watching this channel. You've gotta go seek these people out. And what that means is get out from behind the booth. If you're on booth duty, you stand in the middle of the walkway and you grab people and try to start conversations. If you're not on booth duty, that means you should be going to speaker sessions. You should be walking the floors of the Exhibitor Hall, and you should be seeking out the events that are going on in the evening at these things. There's so many times there's happy hours, there's dinners, there's networking events. Go find out where those are and make sure that you are are there. The way that I think about these conferences is if it's to be, it's up to me. Your success is dependent upon you. And if you are just waiting at the booth, guess what? When prospects walk the halls of the exhibit hall, they're talking to your competition too, and you've got to beat them to the punch. So get out from behind the booth and go find your prospects. And so you'll see a lot of this is a shift from an inbound mentality. Hey, prospects are here to find vendors and have conversations with them. They'll meet me at the booth. I'll wait here. To an outbound mentality. I'm going to seek out my prospects. I'm going to find them. And that is how you should be thinking about these trade shows. And this brings me to my last piece, which is when you're working the floor and you're working the event like that, you've got to make sure that you're protecting protecting your body to be able to sustain that type of energy and output. And so my last tip is avoid the free food and the free alcohol at all costs. At these events, there are always happy hours, networking events, free Modelo, little hot dogs wrapped in croissants. And the average salesperson says, awesome. I got on an airplane. There's free food. I'm at a happy hour. This feels like a vacation. And so they treat it like a vacation, and they drink three free Heinekens, and they eat nacho cheese and chicken wings, and they feel like crap. The next day, they are far lower energy than they could be if they had treated themselves right. And they spent time being distracted by the free food and drink as opposed to talking with prospects. My recommendation, eat a healthy meal beforehand and ignore the free food and free drinks. It might feel like a happy hour. It might feel like a vacation, but it is not. You are here on business and so treat it accordingly. And so those are my tips for making sure you get the most juice for your squeeze from these in person conferences and trade shows. We've got a couple other videos in this series and if you wanna make sure you're getting the most from these conferences, go check them out. Thanks for watching. We'll see you on the next video. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
