## Transcript

What would you say to people that think cold calling doesn't work? Cold calling sucks, and that's why it works. Just like that. Marked. That's it. Oh, god. One year ago, we wrote the number one cold calling book in sales, and it just crossed 50,000 copies sold, and thousands of sellers have learned to book meetings on the phone every single day. So what we're doing today is we are going to answer your most burning cold calling questions from the openers to the pitch to the objections to the gatekeepers and everything in between so that you can go book more meetings in your next Oblets. And if you don't know who we are, Arman is too humble to say it, but he was the VP of sales over at Pave where he led them from 0 to 13,000,000 in two years. I was a multiple time top number one rep selling pretty sophisticated ERP software to large law firms. And a lot of the success that Arman and I had in our sales careers came from being really, really good on the phones. And so we wrote this book where we took all of our best advice and tried to cover end to end everything that you need to do, what to say, and how to sound when you are making a cold call. And we thought, alright. This book might do alright. It blew up, and we've sold over 50,000 copies in a year. And so today, we're gonna tackle your questions that weren't answered in the book. Alrighty, Nick. So let's start with number one. What is your current number one cold call opener, and is it still a PBO? Well, it's not a PBO. It is a tailored permission opener. There is a big difference between a generic permission based opener. Hey, Armand. I know you didn't expect me to call you. Do you mind if I get twenty seven seconds to tell you why I called? And a tailored permission opener where you lead with the trigger or context that prompted you to call them and then go into asking for permission. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. So a tailored permission opener actually starts with something about them. The formula is trigger, own that it's a cold call, and ask for permission. And so that might sound like Armond picks up the phone and he goes, hello? And I'm gonna go, Armond, I just finished reading the press release about the office that y'all are opening in Tacoma. I'm gonna be honest. This is a cold call, but it is a well researched one, and I'm wondering if I can get half a minute to share why that office opening prompted me to call you, and then you can totally hang up on me if it doesn't make sense from there. The power of this is the piece that changes is that trigger. You might be listening to this or watching this and being like, why would an office opening in Tacoma be relevant to the billing software that I sell? It might not be, but there are other things that you can observe about your prospect or their business that you should be leading with and then asking for permission. The power of this is the opener then becomes unique every single time. You've got a fresh opener that is about them and gets them to listen. I think the biggest thing with openers is you could do the tailored permission opener. You could use my heard the name tossed around opener. But the key with cold calling today is it is even more important than before to lead with context on your cold calls with people inundated with AI messages, with people parallel dialing, with connect rates, frankly, getting, like, cut by another two to 3% in the last year since we've published the book. When you get someone on the line, it is 10 times more important to lead with something about them before you lead with something about you. This is a little bit more of a niche question. Question number two is Mhmm. Do you have any tips or tricks for cold call openers when you're calling financial decision makers like CFOs as opposed to a traditional champion? A lot of folks over think their need to change plays that they are running based upon the persona or altitude of the person that they are calling. So when I was selling to law firms, we would sell to CFOs of law firms and also COOs of law firms and also managing partners of law firms. I didn't change the opener that I used. I did change the trigger or piece of context that I led with. Because a CFO might not care as much about about, like, oh, hey. I just read the press release about the big case that you all won because the CFO might not be involved in, like, them winning of the cases, but the CFO might be involved with the office opening or the new practice group that the law firm was launching. And so what I would recommend is adapt your context or trigger to the persona. Do not change the framework of your opener. Well, then let's move to the next one, which is something you're really good at, Armand. The question is, what's your go to way to make somebody laugh or disarm a prospect on a cold call? The first example is not inside of the book. I actually think it's okay to have an imperfect cold call and screw things up at the beginning of the cold call. So I might be like, hey, Nick. We work with a few fuck it. Hey. I can't speak English today. Hey, Nick. We work with a few other, Andreessen portfolio companies. It's been a long day. My name's Arman. I'm from Pave. Have you heard my name tossed around, or do you wanna hang up on me? I have heard people screw up the cold call at the beginning of the cold call or, like, pretend to drop their phone by accident and pick it up, and all of a sudden, it just, like, breaks the telemarketer perception. So if you do that by a phone case but regardless, try to think about, like, different ways that you can just unbutton up the corporate cold call. That could be dropping your phone. It could be purposely screwing up your words. It could be something ridiculous is going on in the world, and you just, like, say something funny to break the tension. You could reference something that you see on their LinkedIn profile and make a snarky joke about it. Do something at the beginning to establish yourself as a human. And then my second favorite way to disarm a prospect is when it comes to objections. So the more ridiculous and nasty the reaction you get on a cold call, the more ridiculously hilarious your counter reaction needs to be to handle the objection and break the tension. We call this being disarmingly blunt. So if Nick gives me a soft objection that isn't that nasty, like, I've got no budget, I might agree with the objection in a way that's not super ridiculous. I might say like, hey, Nick. Totally get it. Honestly, nowadays, it's harder to keep a tool, let alone get something new nowadays. You're practically, like, bringing food stamps to your CFO. That's like a light agreement with the objection. But if Nick gives me an objection like, I'm in a meeting, well, that's kinda ridiculous, and he feels like I'm interrupting him, but I know he's not. So I'm just gonna call out the ridiculousness of his objection by saying, Nick, I totally screwed this one up. Do you wanna put me on speaker phone so I can bomb in front of the whole group, or do you just wanna hang up on me in silence so no one knows I called you during a meeting? And that's what's gonna reveal the human behind the phone. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, The CRM helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright. So the next category is a gatekeeper. So you might open and realize that you're not actually talking to the person. So, Nick, what is your go to way or what are the different ways that you handle gatekeepers when cold calling? So to get past a gatekeeper, you have to recognize they've got two jobs. Job number one, shut the gate on people that do not belong, salespeople. Job number two, open the gate for people who do belong, important people. The way that you get past the gatekeeper is you act in the things that you say and the way that you say them. You act in a way that makes them believe you're one of those important people. An important person is not gonna hit a gatekeeper and be like, oh, this is Nick Sigelski with Acme Co. I'm calling for Armond Faroque, please. An important person is gonna say, hey, could you get me over to Armond? It's Nick. And so your goal when you're dealing with a gatekeeper is to share the least amount of information that you need to get through to your prospects bit by bit, and you're only gonna share more when they press you. And so I break it into three steps called the triple bypass approach. Piece number one, when they answer, you're going to hit them with what I call the slide by. You're gonna ask to be put through, nothing else. And that might sound like, hey, could you get me over to Armand? It's Nick. That's it. No first names, no company b s, no reason for my call. Could you get me to my destination? It's my first name. Some gatekeepers are gonna put you through there. The savvier ones are gonna push back a little bit, and they're gonna go, well, what's this regarding? The wrong thing to do here is to resort to selling and to give them some version of your pitch or try to hide weird stuff. What you're gonna do is you're gonna lead with the context and put the pressure back on them to get you to where you wanna go. So I'm gonna go it's about that office opening in Tacoma. Is he not in today? What I'm doing here is I'm going back to the context, the trigger for why I called, and I'm asking them a question about is that person not in to put a little bit of pressure on them to, like, get me through. I actually want them to feel a little bit uncomfortable. Like, am I shutting shutting the gate on someone who does belong to be put through? And then the last piece, if they really press for more, well, I need to know what company you're with or, well, get give me a little bit more. This is where, again, I'm not gonna lean on my product's value. I'm gonna lean on the social proof. But I might say something like, we actually work with a couple other insurance defense firms in Buffalo. It's it's SurePoint. Would you mind seeing if Arman's in? I sent him a note a couple weeks ago. This one's kinda meta. The next section is on asking questions. And so the question is, what kind of preparation should a BDR do before they make a call to consistently ask the right questions? There are a lot of people who'll do something where they'll be like, I'm gonna deliver my pitch, and then they're gonna ask an open ended question, which is like, so how are you doing this process today? And it, like, turns a cold call into a discovery call. And the reality is, like, you haven't earned the right to ask your prospects questions. So in my mind, the prep that you need to do is you need enough information to articulate the problem you solve to whoever you're calling. That usually means you know the persona you're calling into and you know the trigger you're gonna reference in the call or the context you're gonna reference in the call. From there, you're gonna lead with the problem you solve and then you explain your solution in one sentence and then you just ask for a reaction. And you say, Nick, I know I totally cold called you out of the blue, but could I show you what this thing looks like at some point when I'm not cold calling you? And that's really the only question you have to prepare for. The real q and a back and forth happens when they react to the pitch, a k objections. So once they start to give us objections, now I can start to ask questions to reveal the truth behind the objection or to do a little bit of my favorite places to do this is with competitors. So let's say, for example, I was selling gym memberships and Nick was like, no. I'm already at Planet Fitness. He seems like a Planet Fitness kinda guy and I'm selling Equinox memberships. I might say, like, Nick, totally makes sense. Hey. Just so no one from Equinox calls you again, you must not be a big, like, power lifter or, like, barbell lifter or, like, really care about, like, a sauna or cold plunge or anything like that. Right? You must be doing mostly machine work. The reason I ask him that question is I'm asking a trap question to get him to realize the gap in how he's doing things today on his own terms. So he's gonna be like, no. Like, I I do like to do a back squat or I do like to go in the sauna. I I just don't have that stuff at Planet Fitness because Equinox is too expensive. And now I know I'm handling a budget issue versus a product issue, and then I can more effectively handle that objection. So the next question, do you cold call blindly or do you take a few moments to prepare before each call? There's a spectrum of, I think it's bad to just upload a lead list and call with your eyes closed and know nothing about the people that you're calling, but I actually see more people take it to the opposite extreme where they decide I'm going to take a few moments to prepare for each call, and next thing you know they've made 12 calls in an hour and talked to nobody because they are preparing for every single call. So what I do is when I'm finishing the dial task that I'm on, I'll actually mark it as complete while I'm waiting to leave a voicemail for that person and pull up the next call task where I can see the past emails that I've sent them, which are usually going to clue me in to what I'm going to say for the next prospect. And so what you need to do is you need to get good at quickly orienting your mind on what you're gonna say on the next call while you are wrapping the prior call. And what that allows you to do is build some momentum so that you are never having dead phone time during a dial blitz. For me, when I'm doing a dial blitz, I want my phone ringing out the entire blitz. If If I'm not talking to somebody, it's ringing the next person. That's my recommendation for how to prepare without losing momentum on your dial blitzes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright. So the next category is actually going back to objections. Question number eight, how do I overcome timing and I'm too busy objections? Overcoming timing usually sounds like call me in three months, call me in six months. Overcoming I'm too busy usually sounds like I don't have enough bandwidth on my team. But regardless, I don't think there's anyone who's ever said I've got all the time in the world to consider a software solutions today. So let's start with call me in six months. I might say something like, Nick, totally get it. Just so no one calls you in between now and then, what's going on in six months? Is it like an audit, a product launch, is it something like that? I just wanna make sure I don't sound like a buffoon when I call you back. I'm gonna get either a real reason or a BS reason. A real reason sounds like, oh, no. We just had a marketing leader change, yada yada yada. Nine times out of 10, it's a BS reason. You're usually gonna get something like, yeah. We're just really busy right now. And so at this point, what I need to do is I kinda need to, like, call out the BS and reveal the human behind the phone. And what I'll say is I'll be like, do you mind if I ask you a brutally honest question? Usually, when people tell me to call them back in three to six months, they're just way too nice, and they don't wanna tell me to go away. Is is that what's happening here, or do you actually wanna, like, have me call you back in three to six months? And they'll usually be like, no. No. No. No. Like, I'm actually interested. Like, it's just like really too busy right now. Or they'll be like, no. I'm not interested at all. Don't call me back. Let's say they're like, no. No. No. I want you to call me back in three months. Now what you need to do is you need to remove the pressure of the sale today. When someone says I'm too busy today, usually that means I'm too busy to go through a full software evaluation, to go through a full implementation, to go through 20 different calls. They think of the time it's gonna take to evaluate and rip out their software and they're like, I don't even wanna think about that. But they can start to think about that after you've established that it's even worth going through that process, but you don't get to do that unless you get them on the first call. So what you wanna do is you wanna remove all that pressure and it sounds like this. I really appreciate you just, like, answering my direct question. My guess is you're not gonna buy this thing for the next six months. Every once in a while, some folks wanna take a look at how this works because it can frankly free up a lot of bandwidth on your team. My guess is, again, it's probably not gonna happen for you guys for another six months, but I'm not asking you to go through a full evaluation of this thing. Can I show you what it looks like for fifteen minutes next week? And then in the first fifteen minutes, you'll kinda know if it's even worth considering or not. That's how I usually handle them. I'm too busy. I'm too busy to give my perspective on that one, so let's move to the next section, which is voice mails. Question I have here is, do you leave voice mails? If so, what do you say? Yeah. We leave voicemails. And the Gong data showed that when you leave a voicemail, it doubles your cold email reply rate. And so especially with connect rates going down on the phone, you're a fool if you are skipping leaving one or two voice mails in your sequence to drive responses back on email. Here's the thing. They're not gonna call you back. They're never gonna be like, oh, here's an interesting voice mail. Let me call this person back. Too much friction. So instead, what you're gonna do is you're going to leave voice mails that direct and drive and incentivize them to respond to your email, and it's gonna sound something like this. Armond, I just read the press release about that office y'all are opening in Tacoma. There's no need to call me back. I'm literally about to hit send on an email to you. Just so we don't have the planned phone tag, do you mind taking a second and letting me know if I was even remotely on base with that? It's gonna come from Nick at ShorePoint. Thanks. Alright. Question number 10. Thoughts on double dialing. If no one answers, should I leave a voice mail and call again? I've never heard this nuance of doubled. Imagine I pick up the phone. You don't answer. I leave a voice mail and then I'm immediately calling you back right now. So so here's the thing. Data does show that the double dial increases connect rates. The question is, do you want to talk to the person who is picked up on the second dial, or do you want to give yourself a chance to call prospect again another day? Because they're gonna be cancelling. I would strongly recommend that you do not do the double dial because a lot of times someone will be like, I thought this was like a family emergency or I thought you, like, really needed something important. It's kinda messed up, to be honest. And, like, this is where it starts to get into the line of, like, ethical issues in my opinion, and, like, frankly, like, pretty unprofessional outreach tactics. Alright. So this ties to the next category, which is cold calling efficiency slash tools. What are the latest tools you'd recommend to make cold calling more efficient? That's question 11. So at the time of this recording, Nook's is actually a sponsor of thirty minutes, the president's club. They basically, like, allow you to dial 34, five numbers at the same time. They have, like, some smart functionality that helps you prioritize the numbers that are more likely to pick up. So, overall, like, when you start parallel dialing, usually, your connect rates will drop a little bit. But with some of their, like, prioritization functionality, you can actually kinda get that connect rate to hold while dialing, like, three or four times the number of people. So you can, like, hit 300, 400 dials in a week instead of 200 on, like, the same amount of time. So the next question is, do you have any tips for actually improving your connect rates? Yes. We do. In fact, I have four tips for improving your connect rate. Tip number one, generally, you should be calling mobile and direct lines because those are gonna have a higher answer rate than if you call the company line. Tip number two, follow the law of diminishing returns. So if you've called a number 34567 times and that person has never answered, you might wanna reallocate that dial calorie that you're putting on prospect a who's never picked up onto a different prospect who might have a higher likelihood of answering. Number three is you wanna prevent your phone from getting spam tag. This is something that is becoming more and more prevalent where the wireless carriers like Verizon, AT and T, they they, like, look at calling patterns from different numbers to determine if those are spam dials or not. And so if you're ripping fifty, sixty, a 100 calls from the same number back to back to back, you are going to get flagged as spam. And if your prospect sees your call and is like, this is it says spam, scam, likely, probably not gonna pick it up. And so you need to do things like rotate the numbers that you call from, test your number regularly, don't do weird stuff like double or triple dialing that's gonna make them mark you as spam, and so dial, like, normally in that respect. And then the last piece is you wanna mark your tracks when you are dialing. So when you're calling through, like, a company directory, usually you have to hit, like, one pound, you have to spell their name, etcetera. The first time that you navigate one of those dial paths, write down the inputs that you need to make. And that way, the next time you call that number, you can just punch in one pound four five seven and get right to your prospect. I don't think that changes the connect rate, but it will improve the speed of the number of total good dials you can make in any given block. So those are the ways I would recommend improving your connect rate. Alright. Number 13. What's the best way to find prospects' phone numbers for cold calling? The reality is there's no one best data source where I'm gonna be like, this is the one that is the number one best for cold calling. A lot of teams are actually using waterfall based data enrichment where they will have three or four data providers where they're like, get me the mobile number from this company. If they don't have it, get from this company. If they don't have it, get it from this company. And you might have three or four different phone numbers from four different data providers. Data provider a might be good for your first three products prospects. Data provider b might be good for your next three prospects. Data provider c might be good for your next four prospects. Obviously, this starts to cost money, but, like, a really smart rev ops team can basically put, like, four phone number fields inside of your Salesforce and, like, stack it with multiple phone numbers so that you don't have to, like, click on a prospect and enrich it with, like, four different data providers yourself. So if you can find a way to work with your rev ops team or ask them to do that, it takes more time, it costs more money, but it ends up saving you a lot of time on the back end. And it ends up booking you, like, way more meetings than you'd book just like being pigeonholed into one data provider. We do all this work cold calling, Arman. We've got a great context first opener. We give a wonderful meeting. How do I make sure they actually show up? You do all this work. How do I make sure that we actually keep the meeting? First, ask them to accept the calendar invite when you are live on the phone with them. There have actually been some changes to the way that Google Calendar works, where if you send a calendar invite to someone that you've not interacted with before, like, they haven't responded, it sometimes goes to their, like, spam folder. And so when you're on with them live, of course they're not gonna show up if they're like, yeah, I'll take that meeting, and then they go look in their email later and they don't see a calendar invite in their main inbox. Thing number two, when you are closing the meeting, tell them what they are going to get out of the meeting even if they don't end up buying from you. This is similar to the concept that Jason Bay taught us about offers, offers of value. Your prospect has sat through a lot of sales calls, and most of them have not been very good. And so you need to explain to them what they're gonna get out of the interaction with you that is going to make this better than a normal sales call. The next one is, what would you say to people that think cold calling doesn't work? Cold calling sucks, and that's why it works. Just like that. Marked. That's it. Oh god. There's, like, the logical answer, and then there's, like, emotional, just do it, answer. So most people frankly need the emotional answer, which is when you say cold calling doesn't work, if I looked you in the eye, how many weeks in a row did you make 200 plus cold calls and saw what happened? Usually, when people say cold calling doesn't work, it's because they made, like, 15 cold calls in a day. They got rejected once, and they're like, screw this. It doesn't work. They didn't have the density of dials and connects that you need to, one, get good on the phones, and then, two, break past the connect rate threshold so that you have enough conversations so that you can actually book some meetings. So, like, there's just a certain volume that is required with cold calling. That's the emotional answer. There's also the logical answer. Okay. Let's just math it out. Like, the top quartile dialers, if you get good on the phones, you will have over a 5% connect rate, and you will typically book one in four of your cold call connects. And so by definition, if you make 100 cold calls, you have five conversations, you will book one meeting, and you just scale that thing up using a lot of the tactics that we've talked about today. Next one. What's a trick or tactic I can use to immediately improve my cold calls? We were at a happy hour, a 30 MPC happy hour we've been through recently, Armand, and I was talking to a group of SDRs. And they were like, oh, yeah. We love your book. We love your your podcast. I've learned so much about cold calling. And I was like, cool. Like, what opener do you use? And this gal that I was talking to, she and the other guy on her SDR team, like, both of them were like, oh, like, they they couldn't tell me what the opener was. And I was like, oh, well, what about your pitch? What do you say? And they, like, they didn't have something. And I was like, you don't, like, have a script that you've written out. And this is the biggest mistake that I see a lot of new cold callers make. You need to know what you are going to say so that you can focus your mental energy on how you are going to say it. And so I don't care if you're like, I'm not using one of Nick and Arman's openers. I'm gonna ask people, how's your day going? Fine. You do that, but write that out on a piece of paper so you can call back to what your script is when you are in the heat of battle. I have made so many cold calls, and still, when the prospect answers the phone and I hear them go hello, I gotta look down at my script for a second because I get that anxious feeling in my stomach and my brain starts to shut off. Know what you're going to say, and that will do two things. One, it helps you focus on the delivery, and then two, it will give you the confidence to consistently pick up the phone and make dial after dial after dial because at least you have a plan. Dialing without a plan, you're gonna look like a freaking idiot. How do you keep your tone confident when you're on a bad streak of cold calls? There have been days where, like, I've made 60 cold calls, and I got one connect, and the one connect was, like, an immediate fuck off. And I was just like, motherfucker. I'm, like, flipping the table. I was like, you gotta be kidding me. Those are the days when you kind of need to laugh at the ridiculousness of what this job sometimes requires us all to do. In sales, we are frankly paid to eat shit. Like, no one gets treated worse than salespeople. Even when you get really good, the best sellers in the world will maybe book one in three cold calls even if they're making a million dollars personally every year. And so you have to kinda be able to, like, laugh off the ridiculousness of some of these things and be like, jeez. It's just one of those days. And I know that this day will lead to other days where good things are gonna happen. What was one of your most memorable cold calls and why? If y'all didn't know, Armand and I embarked on a business venture eight or nine years ago where we were trying to wholesale real estate. So we were calling a list of people that own homes in Redwood City, California who did not actually live in those homes. And I didn't know anything about cold call openers at the time, Armand, and so my opener would just be like, hey. I'm looking for Jane Smith. Hey. I'm looking for for Bob Dole. Like because that was the name of the owner of the house. I'll never forget. Someone actually answered. And I go, hey. I'm I'm looking for Jane Smith. And the guy goes, she's dead, you asshole. She just passed away. Click. And I felt so, oh my gosh, embarrassed, sick, etcetera. And I'm like, I'm never calling that guy again. And then I thought for a second. I'm like, wait a minute. Jane Smith was the owner of the house. She's not alive anymore. They probably want to sell that house. And so I waited a week. I called from my now wife's cell phone, because cause I didn't want the person to recognize my number, and I was like, hey. I'm trying to get in touch with the folks who own 123 Main Street. The guy's demeanor, totally different. He was like, well, I own it, but, like, it's actually my mother's. And I'm like, oh, man. I'm really sorry to hear that. And we ended up having a really good conversation, and the guy was looking to sell. So it was really memorable to me for two reasons, because one, it was the first time that, like, I actually got a deal from a cold call. But then two, I had previously held the belief that if someone was nasting to me on a cold call once, that I should mark them in the CRM as do not call ever again because they were meowed once. That's not always the case. You might have just caught them on a bad day. You might have used an opener that didn't resonate with them. You can call them back. They're not gonna remember you. So that was one that really stuck with me, Armand. Fortunately, yours ended in a good story. Mine is a very painful one. And this goes to the topic of do not use unethical outreach tactics, and and I learned this one the hard way. When I was selling life insurance, the way they have you start is they have you start by calling your warm network, so people you know, and then getting referrals from people you know to people they know. So you might start by trying to sell insurance to your estranged high school friend, and then your estranged high school friend may be pressured enough to refer you to his brother-in-law, aka his sister's newlywed husband. So I call one of my old high school's friends, brothers in law, 10 times. To be clear, the first time he was like, I'll meet with you. Just call me back in a week or two. And then I called him, like, every single week for the next seven or eight weeks, and the guy wouldn't respond. He was part of the witness protection program. I was like, this guy told me to call him back. He said he was gonna meet with me. What's going on? And I was, like, really desperate to close a deal. And so if you know what star sixty seven does, if you dialed star sixty seven before you cold call someone, it makes your phone number private or a blocked number. And so I was like, alright. Let's let's see if he's just ignoring me. I go 67, and I call the guy, picks up on the first ring. And I go, hey, Sean. It's it's it's Arman from Northwestern, Cena's friend. And at the time, I didn't even know the heard the name tossed around openers. I was just, like, waiting. And this guy eviscerates me for five minutes straight. He's like, dude, are you a stalker? You didn't get the point after you called me 10 times every single week for the last two months that I don't wanna meet with you. And now you call me from a private number. Are you gonna show up at my house next? He rips me apart and I'm profusely sweating because this is my friend's brother-in-law and I'm worried about it getting back to that guy. The guy in the cubicle next to me can just see that I'm saying, like, apologies every thirty seconds, and he's just looking over mortified being like, what is this job that we've been signed up to do as college interns? And so, nevertheless, eventually, the guy hung up on me, and I stopped cold calling for the day. So on the note of keeping positive tone, I'll be honest. I could not laugh that one off. That was really painful, but I'm glad I learned the lesson because that was kind of unethical what I was doing. And sometimes, you gotta realize when you get your answer, and you're getting your answer when a prospect is ignoring you for two months straight. Alright. That was a lot of fun. I liked tackling a bunch of questions that frankly, I have not had a chance to answer recently. And so, folks, if you like this q and a section, a lot of the concepts that Arman and I were talking through today come right out of our book, Cold Calling Sucks, and that's why it works. And it's frankly the full playbook that I think Arman and I both wish that we had when we had first started cold calling.
