## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this playbook episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my wonderful leadership cohost, Mark Casaglow. And today, we're not talking about deal reviews. We're not talking about how to run a board meeting. We're talking about how to get your team actually trained to do the job. It's how to train your team as a sales leader. Mark, why should people listen? Arman, do you know that over the last ten years, almost every single survey that I've read about salespeople has listed something consistently in the top three that high performing salespeople want, need, and require from their employers. The answer is training. People want to grow. They want to be up level. They want new skills. They want coaching. And it's one of the most difficult things for sales leaders to figure out how to do when the rest of the business needs to be run. The reason that you should listen is because today, we're gonna give you some ideas of how to think about training in a way that helps you do it inside your org without being disrupted and helps you really get the results that you wanna get. That's right. Specifically, we're gonna go through three or four buckets of training. Bucket number one is onboarding. Someone walks in the door, what do you teach them? Bucket number two is your team is ramped. How often are you reinforcing, up leveling the game, and how do you even decide what to do every single quarter in terms of ongoing development? And then bucket number three is sort of everything else. So we're gonna talk about external trainers. We'll talk about some systems and best practices for documentation and other things that you can do to make sure that you are successfully training your team. And three, two, one. Let's ride. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Alrighty, Mark. So let's start with just some basic definitions on training versus coaching. So when you think about training, how do you see training being different from day to day hands on coaching with your reps? I would say the difference is, like, if you play basketball and you watch a video about how to do your jump shot and it's just you and you just watch a video about it, and then you go about the rest of your day doing whatever you do, that's training. It's the transfer of information. Coaching is I watch the video and then I go out and I do a 100 jump shots. And I maybe get a buddy that watched the video, and he's watching me do the jump shots. And it's an interactive thing where I'm acquiring a skill or making a change based on information that I've been given. So training is just relaying the information. Coaching is ability to change behavior because of the information you've been given. Bingo. That's totally spot on. You've always got these great analogies, Mark. And so the way that I would think about this, folks, is to put it in sales terms, if you want to train your team on Medpick, for example, there are really two parts of that. You need to train them and explain what is MEDDPIC. And then inside of your deal reviews, you need to have ongoing coaching that constantly reinforces and applies that training, AKA builds the behavior. For the sake of today, we're not gonna be talking about the coaching element. We're gonna be talking about the training element. So, Mark, let's start with onboarding. I've tried a million different onboarding programs. I've done AE onboarding, SDR onboarding, leadership onboarding, all kinds of onboarding. If you think of the ideal onboarding program, what does that usually look like? How long is it? What are the sessions like? How do you balance doing versus learning? Things like that. The best onboarding training that I've ever been a part of is I had a enablement leader at Outreach named Jerry Farr, and Jerry put together a list. I think it was a six week long program that included the first week in person at a boot camp, eight to ten hours a day. Go eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner with the crew. Find your way culturally, like, get in to the company, but you're gonna get basically dumped on from the fire hose a ton of information. And the idea is to get you aware of what's going on. Then the following five weeks after that, we're all done virtually. And those were group sessions that were scheduled on the calendar. It was usually an hour or two a day where we did ongoing training where we went in deeper. We tried to solidify those concepts and get them really burned into how someone thinks and how they're operating inside the company. So I think the perfect onboarding thing is about half a quarter, six weeks. It involves an in person boot camp where you learn and you make friends and you can have those peer connections. And then you go through the entire area of what people need to know to get a general awareness of it. And then you have a program afterwards that is consistent for the remaining five weeks where you dig in deep into each of those areas and really up level someone's understanding of it. So, Mark, I'm curious from your standpoint. One thing I always struggled with is you talk about this first six weeks. And I used to always be like, alright. We gotta get them to learn everything in the first three weeks. Let's put them in a classroom. We gotta show them all the demos. We gotta teach them about the personas. We gotta do all this stuff. And I usually found that it was actually somewhat destructive to have them in a room not actually doing the job for a month straight because, one, they won't retain much. And then, two, that's also time that they could be using to get started on their territory, shadowing some calls, things like that. And so how do you think about not having them in the action, or are you slowly onboarding them into live action during those first six weeks? Yeah. So I think training can just be learned by watching. It can be learned by listening, or it can be learned by doing. And so I think that what you're need to do is you need to find out generally, most people learn by doing. And so a lot of the training that we did in onboarding was, alright. We're gonna show you it. Now go do it. Now we're gonna show you it. Now go do it. You might not get quite through all the way, and you might not get a master, but you're aware. You're getting oriented to how things work. You're starting to see, oh, when I look at an account, I'm doing this research, and I need to keep in mind that I'm gonna go look at contacts. And this research for here can help me over here, so I don't have to do it twice. Right? And so you're starting to see how to connect things. So I think learn by doing is definitely the way to do it. So if we take those six weeks and we dive in a little bit more, you said it's really building a lot of the awareness. It's the big information dump and all of that stuff. Could you give me a sense of let's say we're doing an AE onboarding. What would those six weeks look like? Week one product, week two demo, week three discovery, things like that. I don't know if I have, like, exactly what it would look like. I just know first week is everything. Firehose, take it all the way through sales methodology, watching demos, setting up your email account, all of that kinda stuff. And then each week afterwards has a theme. So maybe if you're an AE, maybe the first theme is how we do our sales methodology and forecasting. The second theme, which is the third week now of your onboarding, that's where we go deep on product knowledge. And then we go into, alright, how do we actually run the meetings? And then, like, what is our pricing and packaging look like? And so the idea is you need to just bucket it up into these understandable areas of information, and you need to have all of those present in the first week and then pick a bucket each of the following fifth week and, like, really hone in on that bucket. But I'll tell you, Armando, you want somebody to have something that they can lean on that makes them be like, I feel confident about this. Like, I'm off to a good start because, you know, sales is like 90% confidence. If you are feeling good about your product, your sales skills, the person you're talking to, you're gonna be successful. If you don't, good luck. So, Arman, like, there's this seminal moment where, like, alright. We're gonna put this new person in front of actual live customers that we can't just screw up with. So how'd you get to the point where you're like, okay. Time to give them customers. So there are a couple different pieces of this, and this starts to go into certifications. But let's say that I'm training a mid market AE. The progressions that I will bring someone through are, number one, you need to be able to just demonstrate throughout the first two weeks that you're retaining some of these concepts. Number two, then you need to actually show in practice that you are capable of at least getting through a call. And this is through role plays, mock discoveries, etcetera. I'm a big fan of mocks, and I will give you a ringer of seven AEs that you should go do mocks with over the next x number of weeks. Right? So this is all pre live customer. Then from there, depending on what segment you're in, what your company looks like, I see a lot of companies that have really small deals or SMB deals or whatever it is. And sometimes these deals can be false signals, but I would oftentimes have my reps train on smaller companies that would be coming inbound or leads that we might normally DQ. So I would have them be in lower risk environments, and I would have them train on those types of deals with heavy manager and AE supervision. And then the final piece would be, okay. You're taking calls with manager AE supervision within your segment until finally you're comfortable enough to be taking them alone. So it goes from role play to low stakes customer conversation supervised to normal customer conversations supervised to unsupervised conversations. So, Mark, let's say that a month in, someone might be on a three or a six month ramp schedule, but you see it's not quite working. And I know this might not be a comfortable topic for everyone to come to talk about, but a lot of times, I've gone through one or two months of onboarding, and I've seen a rep that I just know early on something's not quite the right fit here or they're not quite getting it. What do you do if at the end of month one, you're like, like, I don't know if this was the right hire or something's not quite sticking here? I think when it comes to is it time to move on, there's more error that happens by waiting too long than not waiting long enough. So I can tell you a couple stories of reps that same way. Like, Jerry was doing an onboarding session on day two, Armand. He called me. He's like, this person can't work here. We need to let him go. I went to my HR team and said, hey. I'm getting some real signals. They wouldn't let me. That person stayed at Outreach for almost eight months and ever closed $3,000. Like, that's almost impossible to do with what how we were operating, what we're doing. That's how bad the person was. We should've got rid of them day two. So I would tell you, like, one, identify people that aren't a fit as fast and as early as you can. Be aggressive with it a little bit more than maybe you naturally wanna be, and then make sure you have HR partnership that allows you to move on from people before they really start hurting the business. That person hurt our business. You know, if you're a month in and your gut's telling you they're not gonna work, I would suggest that more times than not, that's right. Just go with the gut. And the mistakes you make, you make. Right? You just live with that later, but I would rather somebody that 20% on getting it wrong, meaning, like, okay. 80% of the time, we get it right, and the person shouldn't be here. 20% of the time, they should've stayed here if we just gave them a little bit more time. I'd rather see somebody do that than to hold on to people way too long, and that 80% stays here for three or four quarters versus getting cut right away. 100%. And I I know there are gonna be some people on this who are like, oh my god. You're gonna let them go during training, or maybe they've been let go early before, and it's a personal experience. And I totally get it, folks. It's not easy. But the reality is, like, number one, in this kind of market, you can't be burning a high qualified inbound lead with someone who's just not gonna get it. But then number two, it's actually a disservice to that person. If you know they're gonna be six months in and out the door, it's gonna look worse for them. And I've made the mistake of sometimes keeping those folks around, Mark, earlier on in my career where I hadn't seen this as much. And what ends up happening is it's not just this person doesn't make money. Number two, usually, other reps are getting frustrated because they're like, what's going on? Number three, the worst thing is this person oftentimes has irreparable confidence damage because they go for six months just eating crap in a job that they're not the right fit for. So you have to keep in mind for the sake of your reps, for your team, and for that rep, it is the right decision to not string someone along if you see early on that it's not the right thing for that person, and that's okay. Mark, the only last thing we didn't really talk about is before you exit onboarding, how do you think about certifications or anything like that? I have, like, a love hate relationship with certifications, and I think that there's a way to do a certification that doesn't allow you to actually be good at what you're trying to do. And it creates a robotic, nonresponsive way of doing something that can hurt. And, like, however you set the role play up is never gonna be quite right. So if you're gonna do certification, you should do internally. Once they're good enough internally, then they should provide external proof that they can do the thing that you're asking them to do at the level of mastery, which I consider to be 80% the way that we show people how to do things. So that's how I would think about certifications is they're not certified till they can do it in the wild and make sure that they're not practicing on customers. That's right. And so you wanna have these gates of you want someone to be minimally, viably good with your reps internally, but the reality is they're not truly certified until they're able to do this stuff with customers. So on this note, Mark, let's get off of onboarding, upfront training, and you have this really interesting way of diagnosing, here's where my team stands, here's what they're good at, not good at, and here's what I should be training them on for this quarter. Where do you start when you're doing that initial diagnostic of your team's ability? So I have a matrix that I use, and the purpose of the matrix is to understand how much change manage it capacity you have and then how much you're filling that capacity. And so think about this like a x y axis and a three by three grid. The y axis is cognitive load. That's like how hard is something to do. You have low cognitive load, which means I'm gonna just click a different button, and it's gonna be green instead of blue in Salesforce to to generate my quote. But I pretty much understand how CPQ software works and, like, that's a low lift. Right? A high cognitive load would be, we're gonna ask you to change how you demo this large feature that is an area of differentiation for us, and you actually have to change up your demo flow, change up some of your discovery questions, change up some of the screens you're going to. Alright? So we got the y axis is cognitive load, low, medium, high. The x axis is capability. How aware do we want them to be? So there's all the way on the left hand side, there's aware, which means they know about it. Then there's competence, which we talked about earlier. That's my ability to demonstrate how well I can do this skill internally with a role play or my manager or my VP or somebody. And then there's mastery, which is I'm now providing evidence that I've done this skill the way that you've asked me to, at least 80% in the wild in a real world situation. So if you look at that three by three grid, we start to create nine boxes. And each of those boxes has a point value. So the left most bottom most box is one point. Inside the rest of those nine boxes, there's different point values. We'll provide that image so that everybody can see how to score it. At Outreach, I found out my reps can handle 16 points of change in a quarter. So that could mean we could do one nine point change and maybe a seven point change, and that's it. Or we could do a nine point change, and I could do seven one point changes. And so what that did is it allowed me and my enablement person to do two things. One is we're like, alright. These are the things you're asking us to do so we can make sure that we're not doing too many things. And the second thing that it allowed us to do is to say to the people that wanted the training, like our CEO or CRO, we would go to them and be like, listen. We're training people to be aware. They're not gonna demo it the way you want to, but they're gonna mention it and show you that they're aware of it. If you wanna go to competency, which means, hey. They'll probably demo it, but not quite good. They'll talk about it, but it won't be quite what you want because they're only gonna have to show us internally how well they're good at it, then that's where we can go. But that's more points than just doing aware. So if you want that level of capability with the reps, then we're gonna have to not do some other stuff because I can't build a month long program to get somebody to that competency and build a bunch of other programs because there's just been up being doing training all the time, and most people can't digest that much information anyway. So we need to treat adults with an adult learning philosophy, which says that we understand they have a capacity for change. We're gonna measure that, and we're gonna fill that capacity up as much as we want to. And here's my hypothesis. If you go up to that level of capacity, Armand, then you can pretty much guarantee someone can digest it, do it, and you can get to the level of comp capability that you wanna get to. If you go a little bit over, the only thing that you risk is the extra project or two are not gonna be nearly as good as the rest of what you've done that is inside the capability boundaries. If you go way over, then everything is done. Like, there's nothing that's gonna be digested. Everybody's gonna just spit out everything you throw into their mouth, and it's just not gonna work. That's what I see happen in tons and tons of company is they just treat sales reps like they're a computer. If I just input the information, they now have it, learn it, can use it, and do everything with it, and that's just not how people operate. This is totally making sense. So, folks, just to recap, there are two axes that you should think about in terms of how important something is to train your team on or how much mastery it requires, aka the capability, and then the cognitive load of that thing. In other words, like, how challenging is that concept to grasp? And as a sales leader, you're gonna get all kinds of crap thrown on your plate. And the reason for that is you're the gatekeeper to those customers. You're gonna get marketers who are like, hey. We wanna try this new crazy MQL workflow. Let's try calling these leads this fast kind of thing. But meanwhile, if you know the most important thing for your team to do is to get really, really good at getting access to power, that is an enterprise level skill set, a mid market level skill set. That's not an easy skill to train. That's high cognitive load to teach your team how to get into the backdoor to power, use three or four different ways to get access to the top. And what you're gonna wanna do is you're going to want to surround your team with as many different ways to reinforce those principles as possible. You're gonna wanna have that every single place a rep lives. And so it's your job to let certain things burn that are less important for the quarter and not wrap your team around the axle in change fatigue. Because if you get them up to 24 points total and you're trying to teach them everything, they will remember nothing, and your team will just be exhausted with the seventeenth training that you threw on their calendar. I would argue that training does next to nothing. What makes someone change is a program. A training would be, hey. You know what y'all? Like, let's do some shout outs from reps on some big deals. And you know what? We're gonna have LJ talk about a couple things he did in this deal that really helped them. That's like a training, and it's good. It's interesting, but it's not going to do anything for the whole team. And what what you wanna do is you wanna build a program that supports the training and make sure that it works. And if you can't build a program, then you shouldn't do the training. The program is forcing adult learners to do the stuff that they did in high school to get good grades that they won't do at their job when the reward of doing it good on your job is more money for salespeople. It's kinda crazy that they won't take it seriously. So you build a program to help them have the discipline to take it seriously, and that's how you get people to actually progress and get the benefit. And then you have to build a culture of people that want to get better. I would say at Outreach, you know, I had a 150 or so some odd AEs. There wasn't one AE that wasn't like, I'm getting better today, And everybody was dedicated to getting better. And so if one person was killing it and negotiating call, everybody wanted to see how they were doing it. And so that's what training can do for you if you build a program and a culture around it. But if you're just doing training because your CEO or your founder is like, we need to train people on this competitor, and you do a training, and you spend all this time putting a deck together, and you expect people to get out of it, it's just like you sitting in your favorite math teacher's high school class and do an email while they're teaching advanced calculus, you're effed. Look. I love my enablement people, but it's gotta be freaking tactical. That's why you listen to this podcast and all of the fluffy trainings. They freaking suck. So the best thing that you can do as a manager or as a leader is you can create a structure for a training. For example, for this call or for this playbook episode, we broke it into onboarding, training, external training, etcetera. But then you need to get your top reps filling in the gaps and actually helping you bring out the secrets from the field because that's gonna show, one, the real stuff. But then, two, it's gonna show that the elite reps can get involved in the training and make it fun. And the other thing that I would recommend to Mark's point is don't just do a bunch of stupid classroom style trainings. Do one training a month. That's the video on the jump shot. And then for the next four weeks, pick one place that you're gonna reinforce that jump shot. So you wanna make sure this isn't this boring academic exercise where people are slacking around because they don't wanna listen to your stupid product marketing leader do something. You want this to be something that actually works in the game, and you want people to get in the game as soon as humanly possible. Alright. So on that note, there are a lot of people who are die hard med pick, command of the message, force management people. What is your overall take on bringing in external trainers? AKA, should you bring them on? And if so, when or what situation would you bring them in? So I brought in external trainers a lot in my career. I've also resisted suggestions to bring in external trainers. And for me, the way that I do it is is one is, do we internally know how to do this? We just need to operationalize or codify it and then train people on how to do it. And is there somebody in our own organizations that's already a master at it? Or is this a skill or a concept that we just don't even have in our DNA that we need to inject in? So when it's we don't have it, you gotta bring it in. When it's you have it, you should just develop what you have and do it. The other reason that I bring in external traders is to validate things that we're already doing. And so, for example, Skip Miller's concepts are a big part of how I explain how to do deal bay or stage based deal management. And so I bring Skip into my orgs as a third party validation to reinforce the things I'm talking about as an external voice, so it's just not me and my leaders and reps talking. So, yeah, I think that if you don't have it in your DNA, you gotta do it artificially so you bring somebody in. And if you already have stuff that's working really well, but people need that extra legitimacy, then I would bring in somebody external to reinforce something that you already have. But I think, usually, if you have a great skill and someone that does it great, the best option is to sow into and invest into that skill and codify it, operationalize it, and train on it internally. Yeah. I think oftentimes people will be like, I'm gonna bring in an external trainer, and they're gonna solve all my problems. I think every sales leader should be able to get on a call on Tango. I used to love cold calling with my reps and showing them that I was still in the game. But one thing is for sure, you cannot have external training without having internal training and internal coaching. So whatever you get from these external trainings, you need to turn it into your internal version for your company. And you need to make sure that if you're gonna bring in MEDDPIC, it's up in your Salesforce stages. It's in your deal reviews. If you're gonna do Sandler, you need to be reviewing upfront contracts in all of your deal reviews and in all of your sales calls. Because if you just bring in one of these external trainers and that's it, you are literally just gonna burn $50,000 for no reason whatsoever. Every time. Alrighty, Mark. So the last thing, everyone's favorite topic, documentation. Where do you keep track of all of this stuff? So I was saying, process makes you great. Documentation makes you legendary. I think that you have to have some kind of system where you're documenting things. I don't know if it matters. It could be Google Docs, Notion. It could be an LMS like Seismic or Highspot or something like that. It just depends on how fancy you wanna get with it and what all you want it to do. I will say though that wherever you start to capture it, it needs to have an AI component that doesn't make someone have to, like, know how to navigate to the right thing or search for the exact thing. Like, oh, I'm searching for qualification, and I just got 93 seismic articles. And that's a really strong application of AI is to have, hey. This is where we put everything. You just ask the AI the question, and the AI will sort all the stuff out and figure out what you need to do to deliver an answer. But let's just get it documented and then have AI help us organize it the right way. Yeah. I totally agree that a lot of people will lead with the system. They'll be like, we're investing in training and enablement. Let's get an LMS. And I actually think that's the biggest mistake in the world to introduce another tool. I think you should start with your existing tools. That could be a Google Doc. KD on another episode literally talked about anytime you're doing some sales process, write a five bullet checklist of when you're setting an agenda, say these five things. You don't need an enablement person even if you don't have one yet, but it helps if you have one. But it's as simple as just documenting the steps to any given process. The other thing that I would recommend is organize all of your materials in chronological order and just paginate things in a way where a rep can be like, okay. First thing I wanna do is open a deal. I should probably start at step one. I would literally keep them on a Notion Wiki and then have pages and checklists underneath each of those categories so it was easy to toggle through. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alrighty, folks. No need to go crazy on documentation here. Hopefully, you got a couple things around how to structure your onboarding program and your training program. Here are a couple key takeaways. Number one, your onboarding program, those initial six weeks are really that heavy immersion, that awareness. Then from there, it oftentimes transitions to more of the both doing while learning on the job. From there, Mark went through his assessment matrix, which you can find in the show notes, where you'll understand, one, what is the cognitive load required for what you want to train your team on, low, medium, high this quarter? And then, two, how good do you want them to be at that thing, aware, competent, or masters of that? The more high cognitive load things you have and high mastery things you have, the fewer things you can train your team on versus if you have a lot of really easy to understand things that they just sort of need to know in a multiple choice QA test, then you can train them on a lot of those things. And then lastly, don't let your external training be a substitute for your internal process as well. Alrighty, Mark. Anything else before we wrap here? Training is identified as reps in growth as one of the top things that young reps require, want, and desire inside of a company. If you don't have a great strategy about how to continually uplevel, coach, train your reps, you're missing a key component that really great talent expects and wants. And then secondly is our job as a leader can be boiled down to one word, efficacy. The ability to effect change. Can you get someone to change their mindset, change their behaviors, change how they think, change their results? Training and having a great program for that is a catalyst for change. It's how you create changes, how you follow through with change. And so I would really encourage you. If you wanna be an effective leader, come up with your strategy for how you do training, coaching, enablement because that will help increase what your teams are able to get done and increase your results, but it'll also increase your value as a leader. Boom. Well, there it is, folks. One thing you can do to change your behavior is go check out that matrix that Mark put together in the show notes, and stick around for the next playbook episode of 30 MPC leadership edition. Cheers, folks. Bye.
