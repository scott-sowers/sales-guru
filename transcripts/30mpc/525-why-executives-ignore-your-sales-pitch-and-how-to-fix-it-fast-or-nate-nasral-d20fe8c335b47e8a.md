## Transcript

I was in a meeting with a CEO and a CRO, and the CRO English was not his first language. And I used the word analogous. And the CRO stopped the meeting, and he looked at me. He's like, I have no idea what you're saying. I was like, yeah, because I used a stupid word. And so sometimes we put on this like formal, like almost like we're on a BBC show Mhmm. Persona to like show up in front of the executive. If you could be a fly on the wall listening to every executive conversation, it's simple, it's direct, there's no spin, there's no buzzwords, it's just to the point. If you've ever struggled to get executive support on a deal, if you've ever had an executive just like kind of ignore you in the middle of a meeting, or if you've ever felt like you have all of the problems below the line, but the moment it goes above the line, your deal crumbles into thin air, guess what? Nine times out of 10, it is because you don't know how to talk to executives. And so today, we brought on Nate Nasrallah who has literally closed $12,000,000 plus deals, oftentimes using one page or three sentences to justify the purchase. And so by the end of this video, you will have a complete beginning to end on how to communicate to executives, whether you're selling a million dollar deal, a $10,000,000 deal, a $50,000 deal, or a $100,000 deal to get people above the line to take you seriously. And Nate is a serial software founder. He's a multiple time sales leader, and he has written two best selling sales books, selling with and brief and brilliant. And so, Nate, let's start. You were talking in the lobby with us about this $30,000,000 deal that you were involved with that y'all closed with three sentences. Yeah. So I picked this example because it is one of, I think, the best ways to illustrate the concept. The biggest deals that you do will get done in the shortest, smallest sound bites. And so, a friend, Keish, called me one day and he was like, hey, man. I think this is gonna be like a great opportunity. Can we talk through it? And so as we started to just kinda work through the storyline over time, it all centered on this idea is, hey. If there was one clip from an earnings call and the executive team was sharing this and it was just playing on repeat, Like, what what do we wanna position them to go tell? What would that story be? So that's how it started in how the deal ended was, of course, there was content that was built up. The CFO sent three sentences to everybody on the buying team and said, you're not leaving for the holidays until this is signed. Get this done. How many signers do you think are required for a large company $30,000,000 deal? How many how many signatures do you think had to get secured? Seven? 12. Yes. It's just over 12. Woah. Look at that. It's just about something for once. Oh. We'll we'll give the win to Nick on that one. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive goes to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. But it it's true. Three sentences was all that the CFO needed, packaged up, sent to everybody, which mirrored the storyline that they were gonna tell to the street later on. So big deal, short sound bites, that's the whole idea. Okay. Since I won the guessing game, can my prize be what were those three sentences? Yes. So and I I break this down in full form, but it all came down to almost this magical ability to overnight increase the average revenue per customer. Mhmm. So I'll give you a little context so you can understand the meaning as they would Yeah. If you were sitting inside of this company. Right? So large ecommerce site. Mhmm. The product, what it actually does is identity verification. So it figures out, like, are these people real or fake Mhmm. And uses a whole bunch of data points to do that. Now one of the big issues is so let's say, we were talking about how my wife and I met and got married earlier. Right? So let's say we both have our own accounts, with this retailer, and then we get married, and we bring those accounts in. Technically, now we're one household, but we have multiple different profiles. Sure. So the question is, like, how many customers do we actually have? Now analysts had been beating them up saying there's no way over time that they're gonna be able to drive up revenue because simply they're running out of, like, market space. Like, how many new customers can you actually acquire? Mhmm. And so when you think about basic revenue model, how many customers do we have, what is each customer paying us, what he was able to do inside of that sound bite is confirm how many actual customers do you have and what are they paying you. Because if the number of customers shrinks, because we're saying remember, my wife and I, that's actually one household. Mhmm. What you've effectively done is dropped market share a little bit in the sense of we actually have less households, but that's a good thing. Mhmm. Because the analysts were saying, who can you actually go acquire as customers? And on the flip side, that actually means that your revenue per customer is higher. So now you've completely inverted the storyline to analysts saying, we can go get more. They're already paying us more. Mhmm. That completely moves effectively what you can report is earnings per share. Mhmm. So you we began to build the storyline or this web that, again, only he could tell based on his product Mhmm. In order to go equip the CFO and the executive team to go say something that they were genuinely really excited to go tell all of their investors. So if I wanna build this for myself Yep. What are the ingredients or compartments of this little sound bite that you're using to justify the deal? Yeah. So there are four ingredients, two sentences. Here's how it rolls, then we'll bring it back to this example. Because of some type of change or shift, number one. Two, now is the time to respond with, and this is where you bring out some type of unique or differentiated approach. When you do, we'll avoid, now what is some type of bad outcome, and we'll unlock some type of good outcome. Right? So it's a change and shift Mhmm. A recommended approach, good and bad. Right? Now when you put all of those things together back with this example, it's like what's changing is we've run out of room in the market, market saturation. Mhmm. The approach that we can take is I'd, verifying customer identities. Mhmm. Right? And we can do this with a database, a graph that is actually accurate. Now what we are effectively avoiding is no more room to sell, no more market share. What we are unlocking is a higher average value per customer or revenue per customer. Because of shift that is happening in the market or to our business, now is the time to respond with strategy, not buy this software, but generally strategy. Here's the bad things we avoid. Here's the good things that happen. Correct. Could you, Mad Libs style, give me an example of what a good four sentence sound bite might sound like and then what a bad four sentence sound bite might sound like just so folks can see the difference. Yeah. So let's let's, pick a different example. We'll roll with Best Buy. Right? So, and I'll give you kind of the the short context. So Best Buy is realized over time like declining sales. People can just go buy online and find a better price, and they can just shop for it. So what who does Best Buy need to be over time? Alright? So they're trying to figure out how do we evolve our model to keep pace with this. If you guys have ever been in a Best Buy, lately, you you'll start to notice, it feels a little bit more like how did Apple get famous? When you walk into an Apple store, what do you think of? It's Modern photo booth. Modern photo booth. There's a Best Buy by my house in Pasadena. I go. It feels, like, kind of fun. I almost wanna hang out there. I'm checking out cool tech. The the people are like new toys. Yes. Exploring tech. There you go. Alright. So this was a very intentional project called build the new blue Mhmm. That Corey, the CEO, started back in 2019, and they rolled out a version two of that. Mhmm. And so what they wanted customers to feel was this idea of, like, imagine that. I'm discovering new technology. Mhmm. So exactly what you just said, that's very intentional. Alright. Now let's go back to build a sound bite. Let's say that we sell some type of, like, cross sell software. Okay? So based on a shopper's history, what you've looked at in the store in the past, we can begin to figure out what what do we bundle together. Mhmm. Right? If you're looking at maybe some type of, like, record player, well, let's bundle in a stereo system or something like that. Okay? So that's a product. Sure. Here's now back to your question. Here's how a sound bite would say. Because of the shift toward in store personalized discovery experiences while building the new blue, now is the time to build a personalized sidekick to recommend the right cross sell opportunities. Mhmm. If we do, we'll avoid declining sales per store while driving up average order value from now this is where we would bring in some of the stats, like $350 on average to $470 on average. That's your sound bite for Best Buy. So what would a bad example of that sound like? Because it's really difficult to identify products in inventory and we have to pull a dozen queries to make a recommendation, now is the time to buy the Swogo cross sell recommendation engine. Mhmm. When we do, we'll save time Mhmm. Running data analysis while also making for higher, more satisfied customers. Yeah. Right. So let me let me tease out a couple differences. Yeah. So in the first one, I was elevating the message up to something that is shifting that Corey, the CEO, is thinking about. Mhmm. Second, I'm using their language. Mhmm. Build the new blue. Imagine that. In store, sidekick driven experiences. That's all their language. And then down below, I'm bringing out the metrics. If we can put numbers and specific numbers that an executive owns inside of the sound bite, that's what's gonna land. The bad one. Yes. You said things there that, like, I don't know. Customers are gonna be more happy. We're gonna avoid declining sales. Our our team has to do all these queries, and it's hard to see the inventory that's in stock. Those sound like pain points to me. Mhmm. Those sound like outcomes to me. What's wrong with that bad one? Why is that weak when I'm pitching that to an executive? Okay. So how an executive is gonna hear that is a few things. So number one, you're already assuming that some type of product driven cross sell is the priority because we're leading with that. Sure. Instead, that is just one of many different approaches in order to drive up, you know, revenue per square foot or what some major metric is. Right? So when you think about how an executive will approach a problem so think about back to the first $30,000,000 example. You can begin to visualize, like, a tree of metrics or a driver tree. Right? Mhmm. So revenue per square foot, we're gonna begin to think about the number of customers buying in store, what are they spending on each order. Right? Mhmm. Now those are the type of metrics that they own. However, there are a lot of different ways that they can begin to move each of those different metrics. Yeah. And so what you've assumed is you've jumped to one point further on down the chain of, hey, we're gonna pull this lever Yeah. Instead of backing up and starting with, well, what are they already sold on? Let's lead with that, and then let's build out the approach. Are we aligned that more cross sell is the way even with less, you know, store spaces, you're creating these smaller format, more personalized experience driven stores that this is how we preserve revenue per square foot in our stores. Okay. If we're aligned there, then we can go deeper into how we do that. Yeah. And if we're aligned on how we do that, now we can talk about the product to go do that, and we just shortcut our way and put that right up front in a bad example because, like, that's what we think about naturally Mhmm. As a seller if we're not thinking at an executive level. Yeah. Most of the time a seller will say, okay. My product does this, which means I can solve these types of problems. So let me go try to find something that fits into this problem Mhmm. Versus saying, what are the most important things to the executive? And then which of those things can I potentially ladder into something that they're already sold on? That's right. That's right. Because oftentimes, the main competition is gonna be a dozen different options, levers, priorities that the executive is thinking about. It's not the other vendor who does the same thing or is in our space. Right. Yeah. I mean, it reminds me of it's actually funny. Something that Jason Bay said to me when we were doing our cold email prospecting course with him was he said, when you're outbounding, your job is not to try to convince them to change their priorities. Your job is to figure out what are they already sold on doing, this back to blue thing at Best Buy. They're sold on that. They're doing that. How do I attach what I sell to the thing they're already sold on? It's way too much work to try to get somebody change their mind. It's still work to try to get them to buy your thing. But if you can attach to something that they're already sold on, that is how you initiate more deals and move them faster. Correct. And it's one of the things, like, as we've had conversations over time that we come back to is there is always a catchphrase or a code name inside of your target accounts. If you can find that, like, back to to Jason's point Yeah. And you use that language, you've now cut out multiple sentences from a cold email, multiple minutes of a live conversation because that has built in context Yep. Already, they they know what build the new blue is all about. Mhmm. So you just say that. You save yourself a whole bunch of airtime. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. So when does this get introduced? I imagine you probably get a lot of this stuff during discovery. Are you using this as a recap email, as an agenda for the next meeting? How do you actually introduce this? Yeah. I mean, all of the above. So it starts in, for example, your pre call research. You can go out and learn about some of the Imagine That campaigns to bring more personalized experiences in the Best Buy case. Right? So pre call, that then drives the cold email, which then sets up the opening minutes of why you're talking to somebody in a live discovery call. Yeah. As you confirm, you correct, you learn more, then that's gonna get rolled into your follow-up email, affordable email, the executive summary, the opening of a demo, the hand off to CS, so on and so forth. So this is how you, in brief, communicate what's important to the executive, why you should do a change, what happens if you don't, anywhere you go in your sales cycle. Correct. That that's right. That's right. You're repeating basically the same sound bite again and again and again in all the meet every meeting you have in the written communications you share. When you finally get in front of the executive, probably in your demo, you're, like, saying this stuff again and again and again. Right? Yeah. That's right. That's right. The idea is repetition is persuasive. You wanna pick the sound bite that you can play and repeat Mhmm. But is also gonna be very easy for your champions to remember and share internally when you can't be there. Yeah. So it has to be compressed. It has to be compact. And this is how every CEO operates, like, right before I was just kinda scrolling LinkedIn before we walked in here. Mhmm. And I saw a post from Jason Lemkin who said, if you wanna be a CEO, you have to get really good and comfortable telling the same story over and over again. Yes. Because that's how execs drive alignment inside of their organization. One thing that I learned from one of my reps, Alex, he was a former teacher. And one of the things that he said to me, he was like, I was a middle school teacher, and I basically had to teach the same lesson again and again and again to get it in their brains. And one of the things that I've learned from you is oftentimes deals are getting done and your deal is getting sold when you are not in the room, when your buyers are having these internal conversations, and your job is to go help empower them to sell on your behalf when you're not in the room. And the problem is your buyers, your champions, they're not trained salespeople. And so part of the reason you message this thing three, four, five, six, 42 times throughout the meetings you have with them is to empower them to replicate that sound bite when they're in front of the executive. And so, yeah, respond and then I have another question. So that's right. And to build on that, it's not just giving your champion the sound bite. It's creating the sound bite with them. Together. Correct. Because this is how they begin to internalize it. So back to Alex talking about teaching. Yeah. If you're teaching in grade school a formula, you give somebody algebra and you're like memorize this. Well, that's great if they if they can remember. But if they don't know the parts and the variables and how it works and they weren't a part of studying it, they're not gonna be able to apply it. So it's the same thing. You have to go through the process of writing this down, correcting it, changing it, getting, points of feedback and red lines from your champion. Mhmm. That's when they will actually use it when you're not there. It's not something that you write out and just hand over to them. So let's transition then to getting this sound bite, this message visible in writing. And you just use the language red lines, which normally I'm thinking about, like, contract negotiation. Talk to me about we've got the sound bite stuff. Mhmm. How does this message get put into writing and how are you actually doing that? Yeah. Okay. So the the reason why I say red lines, which some people would say is a negative thing. Right? You you think lawyers. Right? Yeah. On the flip side, when I run a deal review, in the first minutes, I'm opening up a written business case, and I'm looking for four things. Numbers, names, dates, and red ink. Alright? So numbers, do we have metrics? Mhmm. Names, specific people owning and changing. I wanna see comments from the buying team. And then three, because that's how I know they own it. Three, dates. Right? Are we beginning to drive some urgency around that first piece around what's changing? Is it time bound? And then last, you can directly tie your close rate to the amount of changes in red ink or red lines from the buying team. Mhmm. If I see a document with zero changes, that means, one, our our discovery is probably super shallow, but, two, there's no conviction. There's no ownership from the buying team, and, ultimately, they've gotta go put their name on this and own the deal internally. So that's why I look for it. Now we can talk about, okay. So how do you get the changes and the red lines and the cocreation process started? Yeah. But that's why it's so important. You're building ownership in the buying team. So I know you have this thing called the one page business case. Mhmm. And I imagine some of this is taking those four sentences, blowing it up, having all these things, the numbers, the dates, the red ink, could you talk about how you start to build this practically in a sales cycle? Yeah. So what you're gonna wanna do after your very first call with your first contact is you wanna begin to guide them because, because, again, you'll have done this far more often to your point, like, you're studying how to do this right now by listening to this. Alright. So you're gonna write out in one page five different parts what's the executive priority that you're gonna lead with, that's the headline. What is the problem statement that is blocking it? What is the approach that you're recommending? What is the outcome that's delivered based on that approach? And then what's the required investment in order to go unlock that outcome? Notice we're taking the four sentence sound bite and we're effectively expanding it from one page. Right? Because if the sound bite hooks, now we get one page of airtime. Okay. So what I'll say is, hey, Arman. It seems like there's some potential here. I'll tell you, most times, this project is likely gonna stall out if Nick isn't involved early and has an opinion on this. If I write out a summary based on our conversation, I'll probably miss a couple things. When I send this over to you, would you be open to giving me a comment or two of feedback? Right now, I'm gonna listen. I'm gonna see if Arman starts to lean in. He's like, yeah. Okay. I could do that. One or two comments. Right? Talk about you are doing the hard work of putting it down on paper. Mhmm. Okay. Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send that over just like I said. I'm gonna write this in a way that you can pass it on to Nick. But on our next call, now I'm gonna jump in and I'm gonna say I got no feedback from Armand. Right? Didn't follow-up on the comments that I left. No changes. So I'm gonna open it up in editor mode, and I'm gonna say, hey, Armand. You were talking about the increase or target increase in view to email subscriber. Right? Public content to email captures. It would be great if we could get some baseline data on where you're actually at. Where do you think that is? And I'm gonna point to that. I'm gonna open it up, and as Armand talks, I'm gonna make some comments. I'm gonna make some changes. So you are visibly seeing the message change based on your input doing doing it live. Then this is how we start to kick start the momentum. And, again, I'm gonna say at the end, hey, Armond. There's a couple pieces here where we need Jamie's input before it's ready to bring to Nick. Could you tag Jamie in follow-up? You mentioned your next one on one is Friday. If we can get to that first input, now we've got something turning. The second, the third is gonna come. It's getting that first one that's key. So I know how to introduce this. Let's go through a quick example of what this should sound like. So priority driven headline, problem statement, recommended approach, target outcomes. What would be a one liner example of each of those things? Let's continue with the best buy example. So all the way up top, the headline, imagine that our sidekick has a sidekick driving a 20% jump in AOV. Alright? So the sidekick the sidekick, that's the cross sell recommendation that is bundled into the person who's in store, the solution sidekick as they call that. Mhmm. Imagine that was the name of the campaign. Alright? Mhmm. So we are bundling in or compressing in one sentence what the CEO already cares about, a specific metric in their internal language. Now the problem statement, this is where I'm gonna begin to build a little bit of attention within that. Alright? So I'm gonna say something like, across our 180 locations, we are cutting the average retail space from 45,000 to less than 15,000 square feet, creating additional pressure on our revenue per square foot. Mhmm. The number one metric to improve this is our cross sell rate in average order value, and yet only, we'll call it, 20% of our orders compared to the benchmark of 35% actually have a cross sell in place. Mhmm. Now we're setting up some tension of like, hey. We wanna create these small personalized experiences, but, like, actually, our number one metric, like, this is gonna go the opposite direction. How do we balance that tension right now? Mhmm. That's what the headline and the problem statement should do working together. So you've got problem statement. Let's go through the next two pieces, recommended approach and target outcomes. Okay. So based on how you frame the problem statement, this is gonna set up the approach. Mhmm. Now the approach here is, hey. We have our sidekicks with tablets already built in. Mhmm. We're going to build a sidekick for them. We can create three to five personalized product recommendations based on a shopper's history, inventory, margin levels. Mhmm. And this is going to study patterns over time to continue to optimize conversion rate and margin. Mhmm. Alright. So a tablet based recommendation engine. Now the outcome, we're gonna take the same metrics that we talked about up above in the problem statement, and we're gonna mirror those so we can show where are we today, current, where could we be if we follow the recommended approach. So we're gonna take metrics like cross sell conversion, how many how many in store orders have multiple products, We're gonna include things like AOV and, revenue per square foot. So those are gonna be our three metrics in the table. And then next, final Mhmm. Required investment. Alright. So if we want to build out our sidekick sidekick, follow this approach, get the outcomes, what happens? And it's not just the commercials, like the dollars in the budget. Okay. It's IT time. It's we have a whole fleet of people that we need to train. How many people do we need to dedicate? And here's if you want the two zero one level, how would increasing that investment change the outcome scenario in the section right above? Mhmm. And so if you really want, you could begin to add a base case and a best case scenario inside of that table alongside of the current state. This is good. So as an executive, I know why this matters to my business, the problem it's solving, how we should solve it, how we will know if it's working through the target outcomes or the result that we would like to achieve, and then how much I need to spend in terms of people, resources, dollars, everything. Exactly. And you should be able to get all of that in sixty seconds. And this is why putting it down on paper, one, clarifies, like, do we have a good message? Two, you can attach this to a calendar invite for an exec to scan before joining the meeting. And three, make sure it's forwarded around even before that meeting. And it's not a 24 page sales business case with my logo slapped all over it. Yes. And this is actually this is very important. The message is the medium. The medium is also the message. So when we're talking about this, it is a white page with black font and maybe the customer's logo, period. So we're not wrapping this inside of our own brand because what does that signal to the executive? This is a sales material. Trusted. Correct. It's it's not internal built by my team. It's biased. It's external. It's a vendor's. So the other nuance is right up top below the priority. The name, the byline, who wrote this, it's the buying team. It's not the sales rep, it's the buying team. Wow. How do you get someone comfortable bringing a problem that may be pretty visceral up to an executive? The example that I'll give is so I used to be the VP of sales at a company called Pave. And oftentimes, if I saw a board memo go out, like, sales team attainment down, I'll be like, oh, like immediately defensive even if it was true. And so how do you draw the line between describing a problem that needs to be solved Mhmm. Versus potentially having a champion go and, like, trigger or offend their boss when they're like, hey, we gotta kinda fix all this crap. So I would reframe that. And I would say, if you if you were to sit in on a board meeting, if you were to sit in on an executive conversation, there's probably, you know, 5% of the time upfront, like, update on a fun win. 95% of that conversation is on everything that is not working, what's going off the rails, and why life sucks for some of our teams right now. Mhmm. And so you are giving the executive what they want. You're not offending them. They wanna know what don't I know but need to in order to go fix it. That's my job. So withholding a problem from me is not helpful. Clarifying and framing up the problem for me is incredibly helpful because a lot of time will go into doing this right. So if if your champion feels this way, you may need to educate them and begin to say, hey. Let me show you an example from now let continue with Best Buy. I'm gonna pick another retailer that we worked with. I'm gonna anonymize some of the inputs, But I'm gonna bring that out and say, hey. Because we were able to clearly articulate the problem Yeah. We were able to get their COO bought in, all on board, and what typically would take about six weeks of lead time to carve out time from IT, they did later that day. Do you think something like this could work for you? Could you see your COO also appreciating a message structured like this? Okay. Now let's go talk and let's run to it. Because, I mean, to your point, sometimes there will be a little, like, especially below the line, like, I don't wanna just, like, message problems, but that's what an executive is craving. Yeah. A lot of times, I remember my CEO would freak out if I was painting this rosy picture around the sales org. Yeah. Because a lot of times, a CEO just wants to know that their executive is aware that there is a problem Mhmm. And they are focused on it. If someone is just all fine and dandy, everything is perfect, you wouldn't have executive priorities. And oftentimes, the things that freak out an executive the most is they actually don't know what's wrong at the level of the business at the ground level, and so they have to start digging in on their team to figure out what's broken. Correct. Correct. So we'll elevate Nick. Let's say you report to Nick, VP of sales, CEO. Right? Yeah. Not another point in install for the day. Arman, I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna level it out. I'll bring it back. Today. We'll we'll we'll level it out. You're triggering us. What But Nick's gonna think if I'm never hearing about a problem, either Arman doesn't know what's happening, right, he's not good at his job, or he's hiding things from me. Mhmm. He's not transparent. Neither of those are a good thing. So we wanna surface problems, transparent. Neither of those are a good thing. So we wanna surface problems that are well formed, well measured, well framed. So let's talk about now around additionally helping get this stuff socialized and getting other people to weigh in on this business case. So we're talking pretty meaty enterprise deals here, Nate. And you've got a champion who you're originally working with to author this first draft. But at a big enough org, like, there's usually, like, two or three or 12 people that might need to weigh in on this. And there's some stuff that you were sharing earlier around, like, writing forwardable emails to, like, get other people weighing in on this stuff. I'm wondering if you can share a bit about that. Yeah. So the idea of affordable email is you are not writing to your contact. You are writing through them to somebody else Mhmm. That needs to be a part of evaluating the deal. You're not writing to your contact. You're writing through them. Correct. Correct. So let's say, continuing with you as the CEO, Armand I I know you're loving this right now. We're gonna laugh about this later. I don't work at the company anymore. That's right. He's an outside consultant. Armand just walked off the job. Alright. Now what I'll say is, hey, Armand, ahead of your next one on one with Nick Mhmm. If I take the plan that we've been writing up, drop it in a quick email, can you forward this on before your next one on one? Alright. So I'm actually gonna write to you, but I'm gonna send it to Armand. I'm not gonna send it to you, but I'm gonna tee up. You will send it to Nick because you will be recognized by Nick far more than I will be. So I want your name on the email. I want your trust now. You are like the best hire that Nick has ever made. Nick is doubling your salary right now. Uh-huh. Like, he's like he he goes home all the day and he just brags about you, Arman. Right? I know. I do. I tell my wife about him. That's right. So all of that track record, trust, reputation, that's what I want packaging and sharing my message. Because I'm now renting the credibility that you've built up because you are amazing at what you do with Nick when Nick reads that message. Yeah. So what does that email actually sound like? Carrie, as part of Build the New Blue v two Mhmm. I know we're seeing a funny tension between less less store space and revenue per square foot. We've been looking at an option to begin to drive up the average order value per customer even with a shrinking inventory in the store. Here's a quick draft. Take a look at this before our next one on one. I have some questions around pilot store selection. We've done all of this now in the name of ultimately, like, we're gonna wanna get in front of the executive who is making this decision. You were sharing me, like, those meetings need to be run very differently than how you're gonna run at champion below the line meeting. Talk to me about how I run that critical thirty minute meeting with an exec. Okay. So I think to do that, first, let me break down how an executive is thinking that is different from from others. Mhmm. So the first thing that they're always doing is they are filtering through based on track record experience. I mean, they have decades of experience compared to somebody below the line. Mhmm. And so when you are 20% of the way through something, they're already seeing a couple steps ahead of you. Mhmm. Alright. So they are quickly trying to figure out what is the point that I'm hearing, and then three steps ahead, what is going to come next, and how does that bounce up against my view of the world? Mhmm. Alright? So it's always things like, scenarios. It's things like priorities. Alright. So they've got a lot of conversations, or as you would say, it's songs playing in their head Mhmm. Because they process information far faster than than somebody else who you need to, like, bring along for the ride. Mhmm. Okay? Mhmm. So does now to run the meeting ahead of time, I'm always attaching the one page business case, the pre read to the calendar invite. Every single executive is gonna walk into a meeting a couple minutes late thinking, why is this meeting on my calendar? Mhmm. And what they're gonna do in that minute is they're gonna look at the invite to figure out what is this about. So you wanna put the context right there. Mhmm. Now you can expect that they're gonna join a couple minutes late. It's how it runs. They're figuring out the context. They're coming up to speed. Now inside of those first minutes Mhmm. What I wanna begin to do is set up what the definition of a good meeting would look like. This is not now some kind of sales training will go through the idea of like an upfront contract and so on. It's not that. Yeah. It's the point that we're trying to leave the meeting with to say, hey, based on the holiday timing that your team is thinking about for the next campaign, we're looking at, do we run a pilot? And if so, which stores do we include? Alright. So I'm gonna tee up with where are we going so that there's a point to it. Now at that point, I'm gonna pause because in executive, you can't control an executive conversation, but you can begin to contain it and direct it. Alright? So what you wanna do next is begin to react to that. Do they have a point of view on, well, actually, I wanna begin to unpack some other things first. Mhmm. They will usually be pretty upfront about what direction that brings to mind. Mhmm. Alright? So short answers with multiple threads that they can begin to tug on. Mhmm. Okay. So next, what I'm gonna begin to do is first, I'm going to eliminate in that first question, do we even wanna do a pilot, other things that may be competing for their attention. Mhmm. Because they know, sure, I may be able to put the money behind this, but I can't put the people on this because I have them on other projects. Mhmm. So with the Best Buy example. Alright. So revenue per square foot, yes, they are shrinking square foot. That helps that side. But at the same time, they've now chopped. They used to carry 50,000 SKUs in store. Now that's actually declined far faster. Now they have just less things to sell. Mhmm. How are you gonna make sure that that's going up? There are so many different ways outside of cross sells and product bundles that you could do this. Mhmm. You could focus on very small type skews that are high value, and you only index on certain product categories in a inventory optimization exercise. Mhmm. It has nothing to do with cross sell. Mhmm. So once we align, hey, of the things that we can do before the holiday season to make sure these numbers are pointed in the right direction, do we think cross sell is the right metric to, to move? And I'm gonna tee tee up my champion. Ideally, they're in that conversation. Mhmm. They have a history. If they say one word, it makes every other word that I say afterward land that much more impactfully. Then what we're gonna begin to do if we get that first question Before you move on Yes. Just to confirm what you're doing Yep. You've spent all this time with your champion aligning on we've got this priority driven headline, and then underneath that, there's a lot of different metrics or ways that I might impact that priority driven headline and solve that problem. Your champions think it's this one. You're teeing up. Hey, exec. You're in the room. Folks, do you guys think this is the one for us to solve? And you want your champion to weigh in and say yes. Yes. But ideally, you are looking for the executive to go, yes. That is the problem we need to solve. This is what Jen Ellen Knuth talks about all the time where she's like, we need to get problem agreement and consensus around solving the right problem before we go into the solution pitch. You're doing something similar. Yes. That's right. And a very important point is this isn't always you delivering these because you went through the process of creating this with your champion, scripting it together. Mhmm. You could ask a question. Like, hey, Nick, compared to inventory optimization cross sell Mhmm. How are you thinking about cross sell as the path to pull on before the holiday season? Right? Because we've worked on it. I know the direction that you're gonna take that answer Yeah. And it's gonna land now, Armand. You've been promoted. You're now the the CEO here. Right? Now I know how it's gonna land with you because Nick is delivering it. Got it. Powerful. Okay. And they confirm, yes. That's what we wanna work on. Where do we take the meeting from there? Alright. Next, in order to get to the outcome in this place or this this concept that we're we're running through, I'm gonna begin to say, hey. We've got some options for different pilot locations. Mhmm. And there are benefits to each. We wanna see which do you think we should optimize for. Mhmm. Choices and trade offs, this is the mark of an executive. They're gonna make the hard choice of what to ignore and kill off and what to focus on. Alright? So if we have a 180 stores, we're gonna run a pilot with a dozen. Should we optimize for major markets like New York City, or are we gonna talk about Pittsfield, Illinois? Yeah. Something else. Yeah. Alright. So we're gonna tee tee up. We're gonna hear how they process that. Now, toward the end of the meeting, the best thing that you can get is the executive blessing or priority Mhmm. And a block or removed with an internal referral. Okay? So what we may say, for example, is like, hey. Great. Makes sense. New York, this is gonna be the market that we optimize for. They just had some turnover with IT in the local market. We need you to figure out what are you gonna cut from IT in New York so that they can work on this. If you get the executive to make that choice and to forward that message, hey. This is a focus. Thanks so much. Sent for my iPad. Like, that's how a typical deal gets done because it's just sent directly from the executive's blessing. How are you asking for that at the very end of the meeting? You've got the the the winding six or seven minutes. You can tell they're eager to get off this Zoom and get on to the next one. How are you teeing that up? What are the words you're saying? Yeah. So, like, in this case, I'm just gonna say New York makes sense. Based on what I understand from Armand, we're gonna add another four weeks of time to the go live because of IT's backlog Mhmm. And the recent turnover there. Are you willing to send a quick note over to Quora Mhmm. In the New York market to let her know this is now the focus? Mhmm. That's it. That's it? Direct. You have a couple other things. I'm looking over at some notes here where it's like stop acting formal, speak to emails they never want to read, draw out the business model. Can you give me some of these, like, pro tips? Because this is one of the biggest areas I see folks struggling as they get in front of a hard charging exec, and they don't know how to communicate in a way that, like, gets respect and gets Mhmm. Gets their blessing. As we're going through this, like, it probably sounds like I've, like, it got this all buttoned up, figured out. Sure. And the reality is all of this was learned the hard way. And I'll give you an example. I was in a meeting with a CEO and a CRO, and the CRO, English was not his first language. Mhmm. And I used the word analogous. And most people don't, like, use that word. I, like, have a weird thing where I like the perfect word to describe something. Yeah. And the CRO stopped the meeting, and he looked at me. He's like, I have no idea what you're saying. And I was like, yeah, because I used a stupid word. Like, why would I use the word analogous when English is clearly not your first language? And And so sometimes we put on this, like, formal, like, almost like we're on a BBC show persona to, like, show up in front of the executive. And what you'll notice is if you if if you could be a fly on the wall listening to every executive conversation, it's simple, it's direct, there's no spin, there's no bud words buzz words. It's just to the point. Mhmm. So one is like dramatically simplify your language. And then the second is when you go through the process of writing, you are editing your thinking. Mhmm. Okay. So when you write something down and then you deliver it live, it changes the way you talk. Mhmm. Because instead of think talking, you've had the space and the time to edit those. So I will guarantee when you are in front of an executive, it will go much better because you will do all of the cutting the dead air Mhmm. Before you get in that conversation, and then you can speak in short, simple, direct sound bites. This reminds me of a story that changed the way that I approach talking to executives where I thought the higher up you go in the chain of command, the more formal and buttoned up you need to be. So it was the first time before I was in selling, I was a consultant. I was presenting to a president of a division, and I'd never presented to a president before. And he ran a $100,000,000 division. And so I walked in the meeting. I was, like, practically suited up, and I was, like, super uptight. I was 22, like, sweating the entire time. And my my colleague, my director at the time, my boss, he was wearing, like, a normal button down, a little bit more casual, but he was also, like, pretty stern. And in the middle of the meeting, one of the executive's colleagues comes over, opens the door, and chucks a chocolate egg at the executive's head. And it pegs him in the head, and he goes, happy Easter, you prick. And he walks out and the executive just shakes his head. He starts laughing. He picks up the Easter egg and he starts unwrapping and eating it. And it completely cut the tension in the room. And it made me realize that if you wanna come off as an equal to an executive, you gotta realize that that's how they're talking to each other. Like, they're talking to each other almost like their friends, casual coworkers, the same way that you would talk to another person on your sales team. But if you come up in presentation mode, you're gonna come off as almost like you're in a position of inferiority Mhmm. Because you need to be overly polite with an executive. Correct. Which yes. That's right. And it's like the most helpful but unhelpful thing is, like, we're all just people. Like, there's an internal monologue inside of that executive's head where they're worried about their own metrics. They're worried about how they're gonna go show up on that next earnings call where we started. Like, I mean, who doesn't get nervous before talking on an earnings call with a bunch of analysts when they're getting beat up? Like, the chocolate egg, I think, is, like, brilliant. I would love to give everybody listening to this a chocolate egg. It's just, like, carry this egg into every meeting. Maybe that's the thing. That's the takeaway. Mhmm. Buy a bunch of chocolate eggs, have them with you in every executive meeting, and just remember it's people. Where are other common places that you've stepped into an executive meeting and things have gone off the rails? One of the other things that you can quickly begin to see is in the most common place is I'll notice people's eyes start to drift. Right? They will start to look around. They'll start to kinda like, you know, you see their hands or their shoulders kinda moving because they're working on something. So clearly, they're multitasking. And in that moment, you've lost them. And so you've gotta figure out how do I bring them back. What most people start to do is they talk a little louder. They start to, like, lean into the pitch. They try to make it more engaging. Mhmm. And what you need to do is then you need to just stop and say, hey, Nick. What if that maybe feels off? Mhmm. What are you seeing that's different? Mhmm. Or now, Arman, the reason why I think this next piece is gonna be really important for you, and I'll begin to create little pieces of, like, conversational glue to pull them back and get them to stick with me in the present, because this will happen a dozen times at least in every executive meeting. What about that feels off? How do you see things different is such a powerful thing to say to a prospective customer. It's also really scary because the answer you might get is gonna be, like, some friction there. But they're thinking in any way, and that's like a lot of reps are very, very afraid of the executive challenging, like, their hypothesis of how this thing is supposed to work, but that dynamic exists regardless of whether or not you ask. This is like a Charles Mulbauer thing. Like, if you sense it, say it. If you feel it, you gotta call it out. And, like, it feels really good. It feels like this weight off of your shoulders when you are direct with customers. It's, like, one of the most powerful things I've ever felt as a seller. Correct. And if you don't do that because, like, yes. It's uncomfortable oftentimes. But if you don't do that, who's gonna get it? That tension or that skepticism, it doesn't go away. Your champion is gonna get it, and they're gonna shoulder all of that for you. Do you really want to leave them to disarm and handle that on their own, or the person who is listening to thirty minutes to President's Club to figure out how we disarm, questions and objections and talk with executives. So folks, this one's gonna be really important here. So notice, that's what's called a retention hack Mhmm. In YouTube, where if I know it's at a certain point in the video where it's twenty minutes in and people might be losing their attention span, I'm just gonna do something to call to the audience and say, like, hey, folks. Listen up to this one. Mhmm. Or, hey, in five minutes, like, this is gonna get real insane. And that's what you did with the executive is Yes. If you notice that they're glazing away Mhmm. You have the opportunity to do an attention or a retention callback with the executive where they're droning out for minutes ten to twenty. We could be like, so Doug, like, this one's gonna be really important. You're gonna realize how this one affects you. And that's what you say when you need them to start paying attention. Mhmm. And then the next two or three sentences that you say after that have to land. Otherwise, they're never gonna trust you again. So like, yeah, that was not important at all. That's right. Wow. That's right. It's a beautiful parallel. It is the exact same idea. Dude, this was freaking awesome. So first, we talked about the four sentence sound bite that you can use at every single point of your sales cycle to explain at an executive level why a change is needed and what will come from that change. Then from there, we talked about turning that into a one page business case with five parts. There's also gonna be a template down in the show notes that Nate has given us in the past that you can use to download and create your own. Number three is then we talked about writing forwardable emails. My favorite quote from this interview has been, you're not writing to someone, you're writing through Mhmm. Your champion. And then lastly, number four, we talked about speaking to an executive live on the fly. So I'm wondering if you can help me out here. I've got a challenge for you and you didn't know it was coming. So Nate's got this lovely book here, folks, and he gave us a first edition dark mode that is a rare collector's copy I'm gonna have. It's called Brief and Brilliant, and I'm wondering if you could briefly and brilliantly explain to me the value of this book using your four part framework of because of shift, now is the time to respond with and maybe the bad things I'll avoid and the good things that might come to me. That's right. I I I love this about it. Right there. That's a challenge. I I like it. So so we'll we'll do it on the fly. Because of the shrinking attention span yet growing buying committees as you're moving up market and working on more complex deals, now is the time to build your message in writing, workshopped with your champions. Mhmm. When you do, you're going to avoid more deals stalling at stage three and dying out of your pipeline while unlocking a higher ACV, encrusting that 50% win rate you've always been trying to get to. Okay. Now I'm sold. Tell me about that book. Alright. So Brief and Brilliant, it came out of after writing the first book selling with, I would ask people like, hey, what stuck? What's the sound bite that stuck? And they're like, man, it's really hard to be brief. Like, doing this in one page, it's really hard. And so it's kind of ironic, like a book long form written about being brief. People are like, why isn't this a blog post or a tweet? And the whole point is it's really hard. Therefore, it takes time and intention to study it. And the only way that I could think is to form and shape the way that we think about our job and to become people capable of selling with simplicity is to do it in book format. So you can really spend time with the frameworks, think on these ideas, and then bring them back to every deal and every customer that you're working with. So the book drops this week. So you can go, head over to Amazon. Mhmm. The light mode edition, this is the dark mode, the light mode edition is is now available. You can also get it on Audible and Spotify. Awesome. Folks, there are links to that down below in addition to links to the one page business case. Nate's been on the show multiple times. He is one of the most brief and brilliant people we've had on the show. We rarely do these long form in person interviews and we do it with the best of the best. Dude, thank you for coming on. Thank you both. Cheers, folks. Go check it out.
