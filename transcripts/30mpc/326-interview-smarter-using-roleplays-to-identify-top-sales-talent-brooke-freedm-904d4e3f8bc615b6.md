## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my co host, Mark Kosklo. Mark, it is the one and only Brooke Friedman. She's a referral from hall of fame guest, Miles Kane. She is the VP of sales over at Chameleon, and this is a clinic in how to interview a sales rep. Mark, why should people listen? Well, listen. I'm not wearing shorts just because it's hot in Pennsylvania today. This interview is fire, and everybody talks about the role play in the interview. If you want to go deep on how to do a great role play in interview, this is a episode for you. Alrighty, Brooke. Welcome to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. So the first takeaway is always have a role play step in your interviewing process. I haven't found a better way in all these years of management to size up a rep for a few different things. I think the most important are, one, how well do they prep and research before they get on a call? It shows in the role play how they do that. I can find out how they structure a conversation, if they're comfortable, if they're quick pick up on queues, if they can open a call and then guide it, and can they close it out with the next step. And then third, I kinda get a feeling for how curious they are and what kinds of questions they ask and then how they tie everything back together. Awesome. What's number two? Number two. My second favorite is onboarding all reps as support reps first. It's something I do at Chameleon now, but hadn't done at my previous companies. If you can have your new AEs spend their first few weeks holding off from jumping onto calls and just getting into sales and instead, you place them with the support team and or your CS organization, you have them work some support tickets, have to go find the answers in your help docs, and put it all back together, package it up, and answer the question. They learn a lot really fast about the product before they get into sales process and learning everything else. And the third thing that they're able to do is pick up on how the product all ties together by working with the QA team on bugs and things like that. So, yeah, we really delay everything for the first three weeks and don't put them on the virtual sales floor until they've been through their support weeks. I literally had to implement customers, and I learned a lot implementing customers. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. What's number three? And the third would be create predictability in your weeks with the team. Have sort of, like, these rituals where every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, you have the same activities you do with the team. You have the same expectations for them. Monday is the tee up day. You know, for me on my team, it's always laying out where we're at with the forecast, what the two top things to focus are on this week for pipe build and for closing deals, and then, you know, some sort of shout out at the the end to get the team a little bit fired up for the week. And then Wednesday would be forecasting day. So that's when I do my reminder on pipeline. I really don't ask them to go through the CRM every single day, every single hour. Instead, it's on Wednesdays. This is when we do it and we all get aligned. So at the end of the day, we can do our forecast call together. So Wednesday's forecast day, and then we close out Fridays on something lighter. But then your reps come into every week knowing exactly what to expect from you. They know what's expected of them, and they know where they can fill in the gaps with the rest of their work and have some sort of, like, rhythm and rigor to the week. Well, let me ask you a little bit about role plays because I think it's super interesting. So you said role plays. I need you to be more specific. Like, are you doing demo role plays, disco role plays, negotiation role plays? Like, what kind of role plays are you doing, and are they different per role? So we do the role play with all of our roles. We did it with the account manager that we hired last summer. We do it with our AEs. They are slightly different based on the nature of the role, but I'll start with the AE role play. We choose not to do the demo because you really would have to learn the product too well, which is a very hard thing to do until you're on board. So instead, it's discovery. I give them a scenario. I give them a company, detail out all of what they need to know about the company that they're selling to in that discovery, and then I join the call with at least one other person, and we are certain roles at that company. So, you know, for us with what we sell, we sell to product managers and, you know, maybe a product marketing manager would be two stakeholders in a deal. So those would be the buyer roles that they're working with. And I'm looking to see if they can structure that conversation well by having done good research, organize what kinds of questions they wanna ask, and move me as the fake buyer to a next step. And that's how I start to pull out all of what I'm looking for and how they would behave as a rep on the team. So you let them know, hey. We're gonna do a role play. You send over a scenario or dossier that's kinda like this is what's going on. But what are they acting as? Are they acting as their current job and showing you how they discover that in their current job? Are they acting like a rep at your company and, like, working through that? Like, what what kind of a role play are they doing? So they're the chameleon rep at our company running the discovery. I'm coming in as the role play buyer as an inbound lead, let's say, and I'll give them that scenario. I'll say I came in, I requested to talk to sales. These are the two things that I told you before I got on the call. Run your discovery with me. And I look to see how they organize that conversation. So one might argue it's very difficult to do discovery with a product you don't understand, And you've already said it's complicated. So how are like, take me through how you're judging whether they're doing good discovery when they probably don't understand 90% of what you do. I think if they do good research on Chameleon, they can find out a lot. You know, like, I can kinda see if they spend an hour or two in prep over the course of the week leading up to the interview, they should have spent time on the website. They should have read the case studies. I think if you're, you know, eager enough and creative enough and you put in the effort, you can find enough answers to piece together the semblance of a discovery. But I will say, Mark, that, like, there's something to what you're saying that I can't expect too much of them. So I open it up with the statement that I don't expect perfection. I'm really looking for their structure. And then at the end of the first round, I'm gonna ask them to reflect. I'm gonna ask them to think about how they did, what they would change, what they would go back and do differently. Then I give them a tiny little bit of feedback like a like a coaching moment and I might ask them to redo a small piece of that call with the feedback that I've given them. And that's what I'm really looking for. I used to do a lot of role plays, and what I found was they were frustrating for me because I would give them a softball answer, but they didn't know enough to, like, knock it out of the park. And then I'd be like, ah, I can't blame them for it, but, man, like, they should've known. And, you know, it was always like this internal conflict that actually would interrupt my interview flow because I would be like, I don't know what to do with it. So do you give people, like, a rubric or some kind of guidelines of, like, hey. These are the sorts of things that I'm looking for, or are you just generally, like, hey. If they can't get it good enough in this interview to meet my standards, like, then I shouldn't even have to give them something like that. Right? It's fair. And I've gone back and forth over a few different companies that I've worked for with leadership teams. Should they do a discovery as though they're at their current company? What I've done over time is evolve the prep doc to be really detailed. Like, you can almost cheat off the information that I give you. I give you so much upfront. I'm looking for how well you're able to dig deep when I give you an answer around what am I trying to accomplish as a buyer? What are it look what are some of the goals that I have? What's stopping me on my current software if I'm gonna, you know, switch what I'm using? What's the problem with what I have today? What's the impact of that? What's going well with it? Those are questions that if you were a consultant walking into any company, you would kinda know which questions to ask. And I guess at the end of the day, I kind of am looking for consultants. Right? I'm looking for someone that can become a product expert with our when we teach them through the onboarding and training. But mostly, I'm looking for the fact that they can be a consultant, ask good questions, and be curious about how the business works that they're talking to. Yeah. As you're kinda talking through it, I'm starting to go back to, like, my fundamentals of discovery. And, like, one of the things I think so important in discovery is, like, you're not taking someone down a path to a certain place where you feel comfortable making a pitch. That's what most people do with discovery. Oh, crap. They just said x. I know chameleon solves x pitch mode, and we'd haven't really even understand if x is really the problem or not. I think, like, you know, when I'm interviewing and and I guess, you know, what I'm looking for is that, do they have that innate curiosity to go deeper, or do they just take an answer and move on? Discovery is I always say it's like, you know, you're walking down a beach and you see a gold coin. Do you know what good reps do? They pick up the coin, they run to the casino, and they see if they can make more money. You know what the great reps do? They run to the little beach guy's shed and they find a shovel and they start digging because they know there's probably a treasure chest somewhere around that gold coin. And why just pick up a gold coin when you can get the whole chest? That's what I want in discovery is the innate inability to stop digging. You know what I mean? I want somebody so curious that they just dig through. And I think that maybe that's kind of what you're after too is a little bit. But, like, yeah, that that's an amazing quality in a rep is when they're just naturally curious. Yeah. I saw someone post the other day on LinkedIn, and it resonated with me. It was like, one of the easiest ways to win in sales these days is to really care. You know? Like, to to be a rep that, like, genuinely cares, and you can't fake that. Like, you either do or you don't. You're the person that's trying to solve problems and, yes, we have features and we have software that will help you do that. But if I don't genuinely understand what's going on in the business and how I can piece together a better solution for you than with what you have today, then I'm probably not a very curious person. So, Brooke, somebody's starting to bomb the role play. Do you stop and say, hey. Take a deep breath. Let's get restarted. Or do you just let them bomb all the way? So in all of these that I've done, and there have been many, I haven't seen too many people totally bomb out. And that might come from the fact that the role play stuff happened so late in the interview process. I've gone through a few other calls with them at this point and really kind of vetted them out. And I think that the folks that are going to bomb, you're gonna know it earlier on and they're gonna end up out of the interview process. So I haven't had too many that just totally shut down. I think the prep helps. Like, over the years as I developed how I do this, try to get better at how well I prep the person, and I even offer them to, like, email me ahead of time or, like, send me a message, ping me. You have questions, ask them. I hope they ask questions. I hope that they clarify something. Like, it's a good sign if they do. And most of the really smart, talented reps know what to do with that, and they get themselves really well set up. And isn't so much of sales, like, thinking on your feet anyway? Like, how many curve balls do we get every day? So if they bomb, they bomb. Let them go. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. One of the biggest red flags that I'll see in an interview process is before we go into a role play, I'll say, here are all of these resources, and, also, here's the last person that you interviewed with in a process. It's almost always the rep. You have permission to reach out to them, jump on a call with them, etcetera. This is like me telling you in a sales cycle, you have permission to jump on a prep call with your champion before you meet with the executive. If they don't take that, they're literally they're choosing to not take the cheat code in an interview. I wanna go through what you're sending as prep, Brooke, because I've done everything from sending demo videos to sending discovery trainings to saying, you know what? Just look at our website and yes. What's the right level of prep, and what are you sending people before? I do send our case studies. I send the specific pages on our website that I think would be most helpful. I include a couple of examples of recap emails that other reps have sent after their discoveries because usually if they read through the recap emails, they can figure out what they need to get out of that conversation to get to the same outcome. Like, if they can work their way back, that's a good sign. I introduce them to a couple of reps so that they can reach out and ask people questions, and good candidates will do that. In the case where, you know, at Chameleon, where I am now, they can even get into the product and start to poke around. So I encourage them to do that. And then the all the details about who what role they're playing. As we talked about at the beginning of this, I give them the company that we're using in the role play, and I point them in the right direction to do research on that company. Yeah. For me, it's similar buckets where it's minimum viable industry, minimum viable discovery, and minimum viable product, like a five minute harbor tour demo. But I'm not sending you a bunch of long form calls that you're watching for sixty minutes because one that is gonna get you confused. I wanna get a sense of how you think through your own discovery practice and apply it to our product. Let's talk about the other side of the coin here for a second. We've been talking about what you're prepping the rep web with and what you're looking for the rep to do. You have someone from your team who's playing the prospect, and I've had reps fall in one of two categories. There are some reps on my team who are just the softest in the world, and they're just like, yeah. I'll buy this thing. And then I have other reps who are throwing constant technical objections at the prospect or at the rep rather that they know the rep won't know the answer to, and then they're picking them apart on those things to see how they survive under pressure. How are you teaching your reps to apply the right difficulty in a role play? I think you're right. It has to be somewhere in the middle. If it's too hard, you can't get a good read on them. If it's too easy, then we just went through an exercise that anyone could have done. So the objections that we give in a role play to the candidate should be pretty standard. Like, I'll give an example of an objection that we might give in the role play, which is, okay. This all sounds great. We're gonna continue to do our research. I think this is something that we're just starting to think about, so we don't want to keep going right now. Like, if you can send some follow-up, we're gonna tee up some of your competitors. I'm looking to see what the rep does to pull back from what they learned in the beginning of that conversation to challenge the buyer on that based on what they heard and what sort of urgency they think that there could be if we just sorta, like, let this sit and linger. No matter where you are, whatever product you're selling, you should kinda know how to handle that and not just let it slide. I've definitely had candidates that let it go. They're like, sure. I'll send a follow-up. And when would you like to have a next step? Oh, next September. Okay. Great. And then you know that they're gonna struggle with that part of closing out the discovery for a next step. And how do you go about grading these at the end of it? So let's say someone set a good agenda. They got to some level two questions, maybe not a ton of level three ones, but they nailed the next steps. How do you know if it was a green light at the end? We do have a rubric for that, and we do score accordingly. And we have a band where if you fall in this band, you're good on that step. We do pile it all up with the other interview steps that we had prior to that, and then we have one total score for the candidate. So it's not just the role play in a vacuum, but we do try to assign point values to each piece of what we're looking for in in the role play. And I will add to that too that the important part about having a couple of people involved in the role play is that you need other perspectives. So I bring one of the senior reps on with me or another manager in the company, like, our head of CS might join and help me with it. And then we will even circulate the recording. We do record the role play too, and we'll share it with others on the hiring panel as well and see if we can get some more feedback if we don't have a good way to make a call on it if it's a little bit in the middle. I was just gonna say, so many people have this kind of interview by committee approach, and the idea is if I get more eyes on it, more ears in it, more brains in it, I'm gonna make a better decision. But I found that so many people are so bad at interviewing that more than a couple people can be very distracting and create a lot of noise. What you get is people want to be helpful in those debrief sessions when you're making a decision, But 90% of their information is just based off the first thirty seconds of impression. Like, oh, yeah. I like this person a lot. I think they're gonna work hard. Okay. I know you liked them, but how do they show you monster in a demonstrable way that they will work hard? And most people don't have that. How are you kinda, like, choosing your people to get into that interview committee? How are you making sure that they're not just asking the dumb questions like, why do you wanna work at Chameleon? Like, what, you know, what do you need to be successful? You know, those are throwaway crap questions. Like, how are you preventing that kind of stuff? Or maybe you're not. Maybe you like that stuff. I don't know. Well, I've I've definitely gone through periods in management where I'm better at it than others. We've gone through hiring rounds at different companies where we missed it. There are questions that we should add to our interview process that we just missed on, we got it wrong, and then we change it. I think that's the key to having a rubric, a scoring method, and the same questions asked every time that are organized in such a way that, you know, Mark, you're asking these three questions, Armin's asking these three, and I'm asking these three, and we're scoring our our results based on agreed upon criteria before we ever got into that. I think it's okay to have different people take different pieces of the interview. Like, there might be a benefit to have one or two people from your organization take the first intro call into just culture fit, work ethic, a few other pieces that you're looking for. And then maybe they get to me and we start to dig into how the rep handles their sales process, their results, things like that. And I think the other piece that has become more and more important to me over time is making sure that I'm asking, like, behavioral questions where they can actually detail out for me an example and tell me about a time that something happened instead of just theoretically. I find that I get better answers that way. Yep. But I remember I learned behavioral interviewing from a guy named Rich Simon. He built that into the juggernaut it is because of the people that he was able to hire. But, like, always found, like, let let's so, again, Rich Simon, huge advocate of behavioral interviewing. Used to interviewing technical people like engineers. Like, listen, everybody has a capacity to be asked, but let's get real. Like, salespeople have the ultimate capacity to be asked. Always felt like I was getting BS on the behavioral questions. Like, I feel like people can, like, know what to do. They read enough on LinkedIn. They can concoct a story. Like, how are you getting to that second and third level so that you know the thing that they're telling you about is real? Well, that's where back channel references really help. Just get go around the back and make sure or ask someone. Everybody's worked at a lot of places with the exception of, like, you're hiring for an SDR role or someone really green that you can't get that read on, and you just have to take your chance on that person. But everyone else I talk to someone that they've worked with or for to make sure that this is for real. I usually find that I I never have just a culture or a behavioral interview. Sometimes, if it happens at all, it's the first interview. But I have my prospecting interview, my discovery interview, my process interview. And for the things I really wanna test, I have test interviews. So role plays, for example, or mock cold emails. The cultural stuff will come out in between each of those interviews at every step of the game, but the number one way, in my opinion, to test for culture is to go ask someone who's not in that room. In other words, go ask what they were like at their old company. You will get every real story. And, look, you can be all upset about the fact that we're talking about back channeling here, but the reality is I've seen a lot of executive hiring happen. Oftentimes, there was a rule where any executive hire had to have a minimum of 10 back channels done on them. And so if you wanna make it far in your career, you're only gonna get back channel even more. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. One of the wrench to throw in this, Brooke. I've had it a lot of times where it's threes across the board. So interview one, three out of four. Three out of four. Three out of four. And by the end of it, everyone's like, yeah. Guess we should hire him. What do you do in those scenarios? Okay. This is another thing that I've evolved on. Right? Like, earlier in my management career, that would have been good enough, and then you get burned a few times, which isn't good for the person you hire and it's not good for you and it's not good for the business. Right? Like, it's not good for anybody to get it wrong. And in a lot of sales jobs, like, you can be great in one spot and not so great in another. Okay. So I've learned over time that if it's not a yes, if it's not a, like, absolutely we need to hire this person, you gotta keep looking. Even if that means that you have to find a way to hit the number for another month until you get that rep in the door. I know there's always a lot of pressure on hiring managers to, you know, have that head hired before the number goes up, but, like, it costs too much to do it wrong. So we really need everyone to be an enthusiastic yes. And if it's not, then we keep moving. I would argue, like and I would do this is as soon as he said, this is the worst answer in interview. I'm a soft yes. What that means is I'm saying yes, but if everybody else says no, then I can retreat back into that's why I said soft yes. Or if it doesn't work out, I said I was like, if somebody in my debrief was, like, soft yes, I'd be like, nope. Stop. There's no soft. It's either yes or it's no or it's hell no. Right? So where are you at? And I think, like, you really if you allow people to give soft yeses and everybody to give a three, yeah, I think that you're you're failing as a as a leader that's trying to get people to hire correctly. Like, your job isn't to come up and talk to somebody to get a soft yes. Your job is to get a definitely yes or definitely no. That's the whole point of the interview. And I agree with you. If it's not hell yes, then it's hell no. There was a time a few years ago where everyone was hiring really fast and overhiring and hiring ahead, and that's where that pressure comes from that, like, the hiring count is so high you can't even keep up with it. I think we've adjusted now to a point where everyone knows to be a little bit more lean and we're building businesses differently today. So I think some of that pressure is off making the hire just to get the person in the door, and we're all willing to be a little bit more patient to get the right person now. And so, Brooke, my question to you is if we pull this back to all the people in all the interviews that are putting together this panel, what do the steps in your AE interview process look like so we can start to think about building our own panel? So step one is the high level conversation, twenty minute call. I try to do it on my cell phone. Like, I don't even do it on Zoom. No video. Let's just talk. I wanna hear you. I can pick up so much just on a first twenty minute call with someone where it's not all organized in a Zoom meeting. I tell them upfront that it's going to be really casual. I just wanna get to know each other. And it truly is because you can get a lot about a person's vibe and their energy and what motivates them in that conversation when they don't feel like it's a full fledged interview. You get, like, more of the real person. And I do my highest level questions there. I just try to get a feel for, like, how successful has this person been? Why are they in sales? I always ask that question and I always get different answers but it always tells me a lot about the person. I try to uncover a little bit about, like, how they handle adversity. I end up getting, like, a lot of folks who have been athletes in the past, and they'll talk a lot about how they overcame adversity in sports, and that translates very well into sales a lot of the time. So So I try to pick up on some of those things on the first call. If I feel good about the candidate at that point and the resume matches the job, we'll move forward to the first formal interview step. As I mentioned, I try to be very specific about the questions that we're gonna ask and not stray from them so that we can't ask different questions to different candidates and get all over the board with it. And those questions are usually around try try to bucket them into past performance. For cultural fit, we're looking for, like, how well they fit at a start up because the company I'm at is a small start up. We're a series a. If it's someone that happens to be at a more mature company, I'm looking for answers to how they would handle a little bit more ambiguity, a little less in terms of resources, not such a big team, not so many systems, and a lot will come out in that step of the interview. We do have the third step with the role play and then we would have a final interview. And at that point, we might bring in one more person in the interview panel. I'll add to this though that I've also learned over time that you need to tweak your steps and your questions as your sale changes. Let's say that you're on a team where you end up going up market a bunch, and all of a sudden you need reps that kinda have more enterprise qualities. Maybe it's upper mid market. It's not even enterprise, but the deal is just different now. It's no longer SMB, high velocity, quick turnaround, $1,520,000 dollar deals. You're starting to do bigger deals with bigger buyers. The whole process should probably be tweaked a little bit, and you should be asking a couple of different questions. So I've learned over the years to refine the interviewing process and the questions that we ask in each step as the company changes too. Brooke, unbelievable show. It's time for the final question. What is one bad habit that every sales leader should break so that all sales teams can get better? So I'm actually gonna give one that might sound, like, opposite from what you usually hear. It used to be, and I used to strongly believe that you should never sort of, like, help run a call for a fully ramped rep. You should let your reps run their own calls entirely. You do prep. You do debrief. You do call coaching. You do your film sessions. I still do all those for sure on our team. We'd still prep. We'd still debrief. We'd still do call coaching. But don't get so set in your ways that you don't change when you need to. And the change that I had to make specifically in the past year at this company with the way the markets change, the way that SaaS has changed is to get more involved in deals than I've ever been before. And the reason that is is because so much has evolved over the past couple years and the stage that we're at as a company. So much is changing in the way that we sell every day as we learn and we get our groove that if I'm not in those calls and getting to know the prospects as the, rep is working with them. I'm too far away, and our win rate is a lot higher as a result. I genuinely believe that. So the short answer to your question is the worst thing that managers, directors, VPs can do is to get too stuck in your ways because something used to work for you. It might not work anymore, and you might need to evolve. Be open to that. So that would be my best suggestion. Brooke, amazing show. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Alrighty, Mark. It is time for a two by two recap email from this episode with Brooke Friedman. What do you have for your two? Two by two. Number one is get in on deals. When I was at Catalyst as CRO, I was involved in more deals because of the economy, the competitive selling environment, the CF No is showing up in every deal. I was in more deals than I've ever been in, and it helped my reps. It helped us with our morale, helped us with our results. So get in on deals if you're a sales leader. It's time to quit watching from the sidelines. It's time to be a player coach. Even if you're a CRO, get in on deals right now. And then number two is when you give a candidate great prep for a role play, then you can greatly evaluate how they are. Minimize this is sometimes we're just like, do a role play and send them a deck that has, like, two slides on it and the the template of what our sales team uses. And we expect, like, with that minimal amount of information, we're gonna figure out things. But you can tell Brooke goes deep. She has a sheet. She has all of this stuff to really see. Will somebody use that information to do a great, role play? And that's part of the evaluation. I just love that. Really great prep for the candidate means you'll be able to do really good evaluation of a role play. Number three, we'll call it the role play replay. You take one part of the role play that you want them to run it back, and you literally have them do that part of the role play again. And that oftentimes shows for coachability. And lastly, number four, I'm gonna do the cussing version of this one. In hiring, it's a fuck yes or a fuck no. And if it is not a fuck yes, then that means you have to throw all of your three out of four ratings in the trash because you are hiring average people. Do not let people cop out in the final evaluation of a candidate. Alrighty, folks. So if you like this one, Mark and I, a couple months ago, recorded a two part playbook on how to hire world class talent. There are links to those shows in the notes, and I even did a written recap of those shows as well inside of our newsletter so you can get all of those resources down below if you are trying to hire people. Alrighty, folks. Hang on for the next episode of 30 MPC next week. Peace.
