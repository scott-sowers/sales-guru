Stop freaking cold applying to 100 companies when you are trying to get a job in sales. The biggest mistake you can make is treating your interview funnel exactly like a sales funnel. That's what we're gonna be talking about about today. How do you land an interview with a blue chip top 10 company on your list? And here's the hint, it's not cold applying even though that is one step of the process. And three, two, one. Let's get a job. Okay. So step number one is in fact to cold apply to the job. What will sometimes happen is a recruiter will catch your resume, and they'll fast track you to the interview process, and then you don't have to go through the following steps. It is far easier to refer you to refer you to the top of the pile if your application is already in the pile. Step number two is what are we actually doing to get our application flagged? So let's say that you've cold applied to Salesforce and you wanna be a mid market account executive at Salesforce. Typically, what I like to do is I like to connect with AEs in batches of five to 10 plus the sales manager. So I'm going to find five to 10 AEs that are in the area that I plan to work for, and I will cold LinkedIn connect with all those people. From there, usually seven or eight will probably accept. And you're just gonna send them a semi tailored message that says something along the lines of this. I noticed that you've been at the company for two years. It looks like you've had a lot of success there, and I was hoping to get your advice. I just applied to the company, and I'm hoping to learn a little bit more about what it's like to be a rep there so I can come in prepared for the interview process. Would you be completely against me treating you for a Zoom coffee for maybe fifteen minutes on a Friday when you don't have a million meetings on your calendar? From those seven to eight, in my experience, you will usually get two to three yeses if you're sending a short personalized note. You're going to send a slightly different note to the sales manager, which is, hey. I noticed blah blah blah blah, the same sort of tailoring that you sent to the AE, send it to the manager. One thing that I know you probably care about as a sales manager is a rep's ability to prospect. So if nothing else, you could consider this my shot at that. And you said, hey. As I get through the recruiter screening process, would you be completely against meeting with me one on one before the official interview grill starts? So usually, if you find the right hiring manager, when they get that message, they're gonna flag your resume to the top of the pile. And oftentimes, they won't take a call, but they will accelerate your path to getting a call with them. So now you have a couple AE coffee chats booked. Let's talk about how you nailed the prescreen screen. The first thing that you need to do is you need to demonstrate that you are worth the referral. The way you wanna do this is you're gonna structure this call in three parts. You're gonna focus on what you're excited about. You're going to validate your assumptions on what it would look like to sell. Then you are going to make your ask. Here are a couple of buckets that you can use to get more tangible on why you're excited about the company. So number one is you could be excited about the stage that the company is in. Number two, you could be excited about the industry. Number three, you could be excited about the product or the problem that you're solving. And then lastly, number four, you could be excited about the company itself and the culture. You could reference different things that your sales leader, your CRO, your VP of sales, or the CEO has even mentioned. You wanna pick one or two or three of those things together and weave them into a story. So using my Carta example, I was like, look, I'm a finance background person, and the sweet spot for me is Carta is a series c two company, and that means you're in the growth stage, but it's still early enough that you can have an impact. And on top of that, I have a finance background. I worked in venture myself and Carta sells to the venture space, and I couldn't imagine a job that I would more want than a place like Carta. So, like, my goal in this conversation is to understand how much of that is true and what some of the quirks are about the sale so that I can come in prepared for the interview process. So can I pepper you with a couple questions? That's your agenda. So the next probably most important step is the questions that you ask. The best way for me to explain to you how to ask a good pre coffee question is to simply invert the reason that you're excited and ask them to validate those things. I might say, hey. I'm super, super excited to work at a company like Carta because you all are series c, series d, etcetera. And oftentimes, what I see is people are able to take on projects, whether it's building a new playbook, building collateral. Am I totally off there? When you ask a question and lead with the context of why you're asking that question, it shows that you've thoughtfully done your research on the company, but you're also thoughtfully evaluating the company instead of blindly jumping in. That's one bucket. The other bucket is to preview the sale. And by preview the sale, what you wanna do is you want to preempt the objections that you are going to get as a seller and get their perspective on how they handle them. And by doing this, you're actually gonna gain their respect because you're gonna put them on their toes a little bit. So let's say, for example, I used to work for a company called Pave, and Pave sold to people in HR. And oftentimes, people in HR don't have budget. And so my favorite question to ask would be like, hey. One of the things that I've seen about HR tech is it's really, really important to get good at multithreading and getting access to power because oftentimes you're gonna need to get in front of the CFO to get budget approved for HR tech. I'm curious, like, am I totally off there? And what you're doing is you're basically saying, hey. I have a quirk or I have a suspicion on what it's like to sell to this persona. What's it actually like? The other type of question you can ask is a competitive question. So my favorite thing to do is look at Pave versus ex competitor. Go do some basic research and look at what the competitors are saying about Pave. I actually did this at Carta where there was a company called Capshare at the time that was competing with Carta, and it was saying that Capshare is half the price of Carta with all the functionality. So in the interview, I said, hey. I know this stuff is, like, not always true, and it's frankly pretty exaggerated. But Capshare, I was looking at their feature page, and a lot of the features look pretty similar in the way that they're described. And they're saying that it's half the price. How do you go about competing against those folks in a tough head to head with a founder who might be a little bit cheap? From there, the final step is making the ask. And the easiest thing in the world should be making the ask if you did step number one, setting your agenda and why you're excited, and step number two, asking good questions right. Usually, what I like to do is I like to use what's called a humbling disclaimer. And so I might say something along the lines of, hey, Nick. I wanna make sure that I don't take up all your time. I guess this is a sort of awkward question, but I already sent in my application. And I wanted to ask you, would you be completely against putting in a good word with the recruiting team for me if you felt like I came in prepared with this thing? And I have never ever had someone say absolutely not, no issue with that if I've asked good questions earlier in the process. So if you do this, folks, you should be able to get your top 10 companies. You have 10 AEs per company. You have three coffee chats for each of those, and you should should be able to get close to five to 10 interviews on your top 10 company list.
