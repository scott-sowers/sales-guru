## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigalski. And today, back for another round, one of the best SDR leadership episodes of all time. It's Ken Ammar who helped build Outreach's SDR organization and consults and helps folks build outbound teams in his role over at the Adogee School of Prospecting. Nick, why should people listen? Ken brought up some of the hard conversations that you have to have as an SDR leader with your team. He talked about stuff that a lot of people in sales shy away from bringing up. Our goal on this show is to help equip you with the skills, not just to do their good stuff, but also to navigate the hard stuff. So we talk about how to have those hard conversations. We also talk about how to help your team turn around and convert. And folks, before I do the three, two, one thing, I just wanna say there are going to be some controversial topics covered on this episode. And instead of having us shy away from those things, I would rather talk about the right way to do performance management. What clear performance management guidelines should look like, how you coach someone through a performance improvement plan. I would rather not pretend that those things don't exist, but instead give you the tools to handle those things instead of pretending like everything is sunshine and rainbows. The reality is sales creates amazing opportunities for you because you have a quota. But there's also a downside where performance becomes really clear and you have to do things about it as a leader. So get ready for it, folks, because this is coming from one of the best SDR leaders of all time. Three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, Ken. Welcome back to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Boom. Alright. Tip number one, bit of a spicy take. When you're taking over an a struggling SCR team, the first thing you should do is bring two top SDRs, fire two low performing SCRs, and hire two new SCRs within your first sixty days. This is the fastest way to make a big impact and to turn around a struggling SCRT. Ideally, you wanna get your turnover rate for the SCRT below 30%. But in the beginning, it's important to make big impact really quickly by doing this. I know you're gonna wanna dig into that. Hold on for a second. What's number two? Number two, your top SDR should be making 10 k in commission monthly. To build a comp plan around this, put in decelerators below a 100%, and put in accelerators past a 100%. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. What's number three? Bring it home. Number three. So I get a lot of questions around how to set up pods of SDRs and AEs. In my experience, the best take I've seen is set up ratios of one SDR supporting two AEs, but the SDR also has their own book of business. If you spread this across the team of SDRs, they they can round robin accounts to AEs that are struggling with pipeline. And that way, the SDR also isn't 100% beholden to their two AEs for their sales accepted leads. Talk to me about that first one. You're recommending that an SDR leader takes over a team. And in the first month or so, you want them getting rid of two people on the team and replacing them with new blood. Talk to me about why you are recommending that. Yeah. And it's a controversial opinion. I've done this a couple of times in my career. When you turn around a struggling SDR team, they're struggling for a very specific reason. Maybe they're terrible on emails or they're not creating calls. Right? The fastest way to make an impact is to bring new blood to raise the standard of performance in the team. When you let go of SDRs, a lot of people think you're ending their career, but it's just not a good fit at this stage of the company's growth. It's fine. Average turnover rate in SDR land is about 40%. Right? So you're actually doing them a disservice by keeping them in a role, letting them struggle instead of firing them quickly. How do I identify who we should be firing? Is it just lowest performers? Are we looking at attitude, morale? Are we looking at other things? How do I decide who those two people are? That's a great question. There's a will and skill paradigm. When you come in, generally, most people aren't putting up the numbers, but you wanna look for the people who are willing and able to make a change. Ultimately, at the end of the day, sales, SDR into numbers, Gabe, you have to look the bottom two performance by metrics and let them go. Ken, when you step into an SDR org, you've seen hundreds of them at this point, What are the most common causes of an underperforming SDR organization? Oh, that's a great question. I have seen a lot of SDR orgs buy it for the number one thing that shows a good versus a struggling SDR org is their ability to convert on the phones. Right? Irrespective industry or market segment they sell to, the best SDR teams are kicking butt on the phones. And so you step in and you do the bring to, fire to, hire to. What happens after you make some of the personnel changes when you're turning around team? So there's always a little bit of anxiety in the existing team, but but the great thing about bringing two new hires on is that they don't know any different. Eventually, you wanna get to the point where in six months to a year, the entire team is turned over, and you build this new culture, this SDR team culture of making dials of getting after. Right? I'm not gonna lie. It will be very difficult in the first thirty months after you let go part of the team. But over time, it does pay bigger dividends. One of the things that I'm thinking here, Ken, is you step in. You're a new leader. You've got a team that might be underperforming, but you probably have some folks that have relationships. They're fairly close knit, and you immediately chop to them off of them off, and they're gone. I presume that impacts team morale. How do you message those cuts and the fact that you're immediately replacing those people to the existing team? So this is why you fire two, fire two, but you also bring on two. You bring on two known commodities, two known top performers, maybe from your previous role or the role before that. These are the people who are gonna set that bar of culture. There's no good answer for how do you fix morale when people get cut. Like, it it's gonna suck. But you have these two internal lieutenants that'll help increase team rank. Yeah. I can speak to this from my experience turning around the SDR team when I was running the team at Carta. When I first stepped in to run the sales development organization, there were something like 20 SDRs and two managers. And one of the one of the managers was just known to be a horrendous manager. And the first thing that we had to do is we had to cut some of the really underperforming SDRs and the underperforming manager. If you really wanna drive change, you can only get so much done with trying to drive behavioral change with the same players because a lot of them are stuck in routines. They're stuck in the habits. They're doing the same things. And when someone loses motivation, it's really hard to get it back. And so, Ken, my alteration on your strategy is my goal was to fire to, hire to, convert to. If I could find two people who are willing to be on board with, hey, folks. We're gonna be the type of team that starts to pick up the phones. Or, hey, folks. This is gonna be the team. We have to step in our work ethic. And I have a feeling that you're the kind of person that can get this stuff done and help me drive the change of this team. You can find those lieutenants within your team, bring in two people who are fresh blood, and that's how you lead this change. But it's so hard to turn a team around when you're just trying to raise the morale of a team that's already burnt out and not feeling great. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. So one of the things you shared is you've got this new blood coming in to sort of turn things around. Armand, I remember when you joined the sales team once, and you were like, everybody's talking super negatively. Like, they're saying, now the only way to hit quota is to sit on the right gold mine territory and just get the inbound leads. And I remember you were freaking out. You were like, did I join the wrong company? And this was very early in your sales career. And I'm wondering, Ken, you've got these two new SDRs that you're bringing in to help turn things around. How do you prime those people to be like, hey. You're gonna get some negativity. There's gonna be some people that are complaining. I'm raising the standards as a leader. How do you make sure that those people are protected from having a well of their minds poisoned? That's a tough question, but it's a simple answer. You should let them know ahead of time. Hey. I'm bringing you on to turn the ship around. I need your help. Here's what we're facing. It's important to have a well thought out career path for them. You don't wanna promise them a promotion, but you wanna let them know that if they help you around this SCRT, there will be a road, maybe in a year, maybe in two years. Other than just telling them to do it and providing career pathing and promotion opportunities, how do you actually get the behavior to be different? Do you start doing minimum activity commitments? How do you get them to do the new way of doing things? Yes. And that's where actionable, tip number two comes in. Right? Have the ability for them to make 10 k in commission monthly as an SDR. If you incentivize the right behavior, they'll naturally follow that right behavior. It's like managing the floor versus managing the ceiling. So, Ken, let's just put this into reality. Let's say an SDR has a 15 meeting per month, which is oftentimes what an average quota looks like. How many meetings would they have to book in your mind to make 6 figure or 5 figures in a single month? Yes. Definitely. Anything at 150% usually should qualify for 200% of their monthly OTE. At the last company I was at, we built out the comp plan that way where, no joke, one of my SDRs made in a month 22.5 k in commission. They flew their number out, and it it was incredible. It had to go through our CRO, finance, everything. We talked a little bit about morale. Right? This is one of the two SCRs I brought over to turn around the struggling team. After the other SCRs heard how much money that SCR made, everything changed, like, literally overnight. Everyone was getting after and after. So talk to me about how the plan is structured. You basically have different tiers based on the number of meetings that they booked. And there were two things that you shared. One was you have decelerators when they're below 100%. So talk to me about what it looks like below 100%, and then talk to me about what the actual accelerator structure was above quota. To get any CFO or a finance leader to buy off in a deal like this, you have to make it juicy in terms of 150% equals 200%. At the same time, you've gotta give them a concession. Our concession was anything below 70% attainment was a cliff. If you got 70% or lower, you got zero in commission. But on the flip side, if you got 150% or above, you got 200% plus. And then you just tear it out however you see fit. 100 equals, you know, 90% of of commission, 110% equals a 120% of commission, and so on and so forth. Can one of the contrarian takes be the SDR role is a first sales role? It's a role where people are meant to be learning and figuring out how to sell for the first time. And this feels like for someone who just graduated college, a very feast or famine type of environment. It reminds me of what insurance sales look like, which is you either made nothing and you couldn't pay rent, or you were filthy rich. How would you respond to someone like that? And I I think that's true. Right? Like, sales is hard. The hardest part of the sales funnel prospecting, we're giving to the youngest, typically, the the people with the least amount of experience. Right? But at the same time, if you want your SDRs to make amazing AEs, they've gotta master the hardest part of the sales funnel. Right? I don't think everyone's cut out for sales. I think anyone can do it, but not everyone is meant to do so. Folks, if you're listening to this as a rep, this might sound really intense and intimidating. I wanna give you two examples. Number one, when I was selling insurance, and also I have a lot of friends who've worked in real estate brokerages, is they're 100% commission. So you don't make anything unless you close, and most people don't make it very far. Number two, there are certain teams where the top top performers make stupid money. I had some friends who worked for TripActions, and the top performers that weren't selling, like, these insanely massive deals, they were making close to 7 figures, which is bonkers. And the thing is for the company, those are the company's most profitable prized performers who are getting 30 other job offers on their doorstep. The price of losing a top performer in sales is massive. And the easiest way to lose a top performer in sales is when overhiring happens and they feel like their performance is subsidizing the rest of the team. And so if you wanna save your life as a sales leader, oftentimes, saving your life means saving your top performers and making sure that your top performers stay on the team. Unfortunately, that means not everyone is going to make a ton of money, but they have the opportunity to make a ton of money, which is not the case on every team. Ken, I wanna move this over to the performance management side of the conversation, which is something that people are oftentimes really afraid to talk about. But I think we need to talk about it because no one teaches people how to have these conversations, and so you're forced to figure out how to let people go the wrong way. I just wanna talk about performance guidelines. What leads or does not lead to a performance improvement plan in your eyes in the traditional SDR org? Yes. I have hired hundreds of SDRs, and I've also fired hundreds. I've seen every variation of performance improvement plan. The simplest ones are usually better. My take on this is if you miss quota two months in a row, you qualify for a two month PIP. If you don't beat your PIP, you're let go. And when someone goes on a quote, unquote PIP, what does that usually look like? So they're given a sixty day plan to hit a 100% plus of target. When do you introduce that concept? Yes. That's a great question. In the interview process, but we really harp on it during onboarding. Right? The first week of onboarding, we have a whole day dedicated specifically to expectation setting, goal setting, ramp, quota, metrics, pips. It's a very black and white, structure. Right? It should never come as a surprise to a rep when they go on a plane. Right? Right. You're setting expectations very early in terms of quota, activity level, etcetera. Someone now qualifies for PIP. You need to have that conversation with them. Are you doing it in their one on one? Are you scheduling a separate meeting? Slacking it to them? Emailing it to them? What's the medium for the conversation? And then what does the conversation actually look like with the rep who's been put on a PIP? It's always a Zoom call with HR. There's a template you follow. There's a talk track you follow. And it's a very clear cut. Hey. Your performance over the last two months has struggled. You qualify for a PIP. Here's what the PIP looks like, weekly benchmarks, monthly benchmarks. Here's your target and what we expect you to hit. Ken, what's your perspective on making the PIP guidelines clear, cut, and dry versus saying there can be exceptions. I've had leaders in the past that say, no. I don't wanna have a public rule on the wall that says, if you misquote twice, you are on PIP because there can be nuance in the way they're building pipeline or in their forecast or other stuff like that. I'm curious how black and white should it be. So in my perspective, it should be very clear. Right? Everyone should know what the rules are. Everyone should know that they can make a lot of money. They should also know on the downside that they could be put on plan if they missed performance two months in a row. Right? Consistency is really important in an SCR role. Your inputs leads to your outputs. If you miss two months in a row, you will be put on a plan, at least in in the orgs I've run. We've had reps beat pips many times. Most of the reps who beat pips later became top performers. Tell me more about that. So once someone goes on PIP I've had this happen where I've had put reps on a performance improvement plan. And what happens is we basically set up weekly commitments and we more frequent check ins, and it's just function to get really tight and cut out all the other BS that they might have been working on. And they actually built some really good habits because they're forced to. And so Ken talked to me like, okay. Independent of the shot clock that someone is on, how do you actually coach them to succeed and pass through what is a really hard moment in their career? Obviously, there's weekly benchmark benchmarks, monthly benchmarks as well too. One thing I offer all the people at Plur and Plan, right, is I offer an hour long optional live prospecting coaching session. I carve out time in my week to sit down with them and coach them, right, or prospect with them. It's really an hour they can choose to use as they see fit. The the reps who beat plans, who learn the most, right, take the most of this time. They co prospect with me. They have me make cold calls on their behalf. And if I'm putting someone on a plan, I will work my ass off to help them beat the plan. That's my commitment to them. But the on the flip side, I expect them to perform as well. What do you do when you're putting someone on plan and you just know from the moment the plan begins, I just know this is gonna work out, but you gotta stick it out for another thirty or sixty days? Yes. So there is on those sixty day plans, there's really two key benchmarks. Right? That thirty day mark and that sixty day mark. If they're below their target on that thirty day mark and there is an upside to beat it in their second month, we let go of them early. How often are you revisiting or reminding them of their status? I think sometimes we coddle our reps too much. This is a performance based sport. This is sales. This is SDRing. Like, they should know they're on a PIP. They should know their metrics, and they should review their metrics with their leader or myself every week. So let's go into the details there. You have week over week benchmarks, month over month benchmarks. If I'm trying to coach someone and I want them to succeed on a plan, what do those look like? So the weekly benchmarks are usually around inputs. Right? The monthly benchmarks are around did you get to your meeting or your opportunity target. What do the input benchmarks usually look like? Most of my orgs have a a strong bias towards phone calls, connects, and conversations with prospect. But, obviously, the top leading indicator would be how many people are you putting sequence per day? How are you replying to prospects? Are you getting at or above your call KPI? Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. And what would a typical number be? If I wanted to create this for myself so that I could instill myself with some discipline independent of a plan, what would a good number be for number of prospects, sequence, etcetera, those other metrics you mentioned as well? Yes. So it seems a bit aggressive. Right? The 20 people added to sequence per day and a 100 phone calls per day. How do you think about daily versus weekly commitments? I have a strong preference for daily, but I understand there's holidays. Things can come up like trainings or SKOs. So we tend to look at it more holistically weekly. Right? You might be light on Monday because you have a ton of conversations with prospects, so you couldn't add them any people to sequence. But we'd expect you to make up for it by the end of the week. And so you've got 20 prospects per day in the sequence. If you're doing 25 accounts per week, three to five prospects pop, you're looking at 25 times four. That's a 100 prospects. That's not crazy. 100 cold calls a day. That's 500 cold calls in a week. That's a lot of cold calls. I bet rep and leader, even the leaders, they were probably happy for a second, but they also probably puked in their mouth for a second when they heard that number. How do you get people to do a 100 cold calls in a day without a parallel dialer? Yeah. I hate to be that sales leader who says, back in my day, I didn't have a parallel dialer. But quite frankly, back in my day, I didn't have a parallel dialer. I was putting 300 phone calls a day. People overestimate how long a cold call takes. Your average connect rate in the org is probably four or 5%. In an hour, you can make sixty, seventy phone calls if no one picks up. It's not that difficult. You have eight hours in a day to make a 100 phone calls. A lot of people freak out when they hear this 100 dials a day number, but I was doing 50 dials a day in one hour as an AE, as an account executive, full book of business. You're an SDR. You're not taking customer calls. How can you not make time to call for two hours per day? That's one morning block and one afternoon block. You do your morning dials, 1PM dials, or in the morning, and you've got six other hours. What else are you doing? Like, you're researching the accounts, pulling the accounts, finding the prospects. There are tools that make that much faster Today, it's not like you're tailoring every single email. People don't do that. They usually tailor the first email. And so where's the time going? I've seen AEs dial 200 times per week. Why can't an SDR do 400 a week? It's not unreasonable. Ken, I wanna ask. I presume there are times when you introduce that KPI to SDRs. They're like, there's no way I can hit that, or they're not hitting that number right now. What is the line of questioning in terms of you're talking to an SDR that's made a 100 calls in a week, and they need to be at a 100 calls in a day. How do you help them solve the problem? Is there a line of questioning that you go to figure out where the bottleneck is? Is there a specific set of recommendations you make to help them get that number up? How do you solve that for them or with them rather? Yeah. So I solve it with them in one of two ways. Right? One, if they're making a 100 calls a week and they're not treading towards quota, that's a separate discussion. You can prepip conversation. But on the flip side, occasionally, you run into SDRs who are putting in the bare minimum, but somehow converting into opportunities and meetings. Those are great conversation. Right? So we have that complaint built ahead of time, and we can literally walk through how much of an impact based on the math, how much more thousands of dollars in commission they can make for just a tiny bit more effort. And it's a very clear cut. Hey. If you wanna make an extra 5 k per month, put in an extra hour per day of cold call. I think any SDR would take that up. So talk to me about I wanna make this real. So there's a team that I'm work working with. I do some advisory work, and the SDRs are at seventy, eighty calls a week. One of the problems they're running into is they've got data in all sorts of different systems. It's really hard to even get people into sequence. And I didn't figure that out until having a series of conversations with folks. Let's say you do a lot of consulting work, Ken. You go in and you sit down with an SDR leader and hear something like that. The numbers are there. What are you looking at to help determine the root cause of the call volume problem? These people are working their butts off. It was something in the mechanical operations of getting people into sequence was dramatically slowing them down. But, usually, in our consulting practice, it's a a targeting problem. One of the big problems that we identify with SDRs when they struggle to hit, you know, certain volume of benchmarks is you gotta remember, if we take a step back, an SDR is typically brand new, an SDR manager is typically brand new to management coaching. Right? They might not know the ICP of the product they sell. Mapping out the exact titles and stakeholders of the exact departments and verticals they sell into and having that as kind of a a framework for SDRs to go through LinkedIn and find that exact title and put into a high touch or low touch sequence can typically solve a lot of these operational challenges. Ken, I'm curious. There are tools that are really helping people automate a lot of data entry in the SDR role. That is oftentimes letting SDRs spend more time on the phones because they can automate data entry and sort of the templatize them that emailing, and then they can just make calls on the key accounts. Have you seen any merit to that? Are there any places where you've seen people use some new age tech that can automate some of the traditional grunt work of the SDR role? Yes. So it it's really interesting. Clay and AI, the way we see it, it's dividing the market of outbound SCRs into haves and have nots. And what I mean by that specifically is back in 2018 when I was slinging Outreach and SEP was new, even if you did poorly with it, you'd still yield some results. Outreach or other SAPs would amplify what you put in. We're noticing it more with clients that are using Clay or other AI tools out there that they're getting more garbage out or they're doing even better. Right? It it really does depend on if they have, like, fully baked out outbound strategy. I think one of the biggest lies AI tools out there say is that, oh, you'll have more time savings. But in practice, most SDR teams or sales teams don't actually make use of that extra time or just be very rigorous when it comes to things like that. If you look at it since the emergence of sales engagement platforms, email volume has gone up. But if you look at the number of calls that are made, it's actually gone down substantially. And if you look at the average SDR quotas, they're usually around 12 to 16 meetings. They've pretty much stayed the same for the last ten years. The outputs have actually gone so, So, Ken, if I were gonna start to do this the right way, and if I were like, okay. I'm not going to do this traditional, like, phone book style, calling down every single person in the world, where would be the first places you would look to automate certain things in the SDR function? Here's a bit of a contrarian take. The one tool I'd look into would be something like an AI dialer. Right? We do know phone is the highest converting outbound channel. It's also the least congested to your point. Right? Email, at this point, I think that channel is only gonna diminish more and more over time, and the effort to stick out in the inbox isn't really worth the amount of time you put into it. On that flip side, having something like an AI dialer, like the two most popular Nook's and Orem, makes the biggest time savings for an SDR and have the most profound impact in their quota team. Ken, this was a clinic on SDR, org structure, performance stuff. So, Ken, I appreciate you being willing to go there. My final question for you is this. What is one bad habit that all sales leaders should break so that every SDR team gets a little bit better? One actionable tip, one key takeaway for sales leaders, don't be afraid to fire fast. An SDR role should set up your top performing a's, but it should sort out the best SDRs from those who maybe wanna see if sales is right for them. Right? Have a very clear cut benchmark for what good is, what gets you promoted, but also what gets you let go from the team. Ken, amazing show. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Alrighty, Nick. It is time for a two by two recap from this episode with Ken Amar. What do you have for your two? My first one is you should be introducing metrics and quota expectations during onboarding. That's the first time you should be talking about stuff like, hey. You don't hit the number. The PIP concept exists, and this is what that looks like. So set those expectations before they even start making their first calls to make it extremely clear. The next one is you should structure your comp plans so that the top performers are making crazy money. And in order to get your finance team to approve this, you should put decelerators in place. Ken has it. So if somebody does not break 70% of quota, they don't make any commission. That enables him to pay the top performing people crazy money. Number three, if you're turning around an SDR team, it's really hard to turn around a team by just trying to moding players a little bit more. You need some new blood on the team. Ken talked about bringing two SDRs, firing two SDRs, and then hiring two to bring some new life back into the team. And then lastly, number four, when you're pairing up SDRs and AEs, while one to one pairings can be great, they oftentimes have big issues with continuity and risk. So instead, try to pod up your AEs and SDRs where it might be four to two or one to two, for example. And then what you do is you have a book of named accounts for your account executives and then a pool where SDRs can build their own territories on b and c tier accounts and get more meetings that AEs might not be and get more meetings where AEs don't necessarily need to be prioritizing their key accounts. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out? So in a couple weeks, you, Harmand, and Ken, are gonna be doing a live tactic tech teardown session on the ultimate thirty day SDR onboarding program. Ken has an extremely practical day by day, session by session outline for how you get your SDRs from day one to thirty days in. I recommend signing up for this one. There's a link in the show notes. Check it out. Go join. We'll see you next week on the show.
