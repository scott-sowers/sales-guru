## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes of president's club. My name is Arma Troke. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the one and only Josh Kirkham. He's the manager of emerging sales at the one and only Vidyard, an amazing sponsor for us. Nick, why should people listen? Well, Nick Sigelski, a couple years ago, wishes he could have listened to this episode because I wouldn't have sent such awkward prospecting videos where I wore a ill fitted dress shirt and I looked like I was in a cave. So if that's you, please listen. Three, two, one. Nick's in a cave. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Josh. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Awesome. So first actionable takeaway for the team here. Keep your prospecting videos to under a minute or as close to a minute as you can. We've all heard that term that people have the attention span of Goldfish. Right? So we wanna think of our prospecting videos or even just our videos in general like a voice mail. Introduce yourself, say why you're reaching out to that hook sentence, and then ask for a next step, whatever that is. Beautiful. What's number two, Josh? Action item number two is don't be afraid to get creative. If you have a personality, bring it out, obviously, within reason of this too. It really helps our prospects understand who you are, and even then, it doesn't always have to be perfectly scripted. Right? If you're on a live call, it wouldn't be either. So be creative where you can. Nice. What's number three, Josh? Round this out. Number three is video blitzes. So just like when we're doing cold calls, you don't do a call, then you send an email, and then do something else. Do everything in bulk. It'll help you stay efficient as you're making your videos and doing your prospecting efforts, Sue. So let's talk about this getting creative thing. And what was creative six months or a year ago was, you know, writing someone's name on a whiteboard and holding it up and saying, like, hey, like, take a meeting with me blah blah blah blah. And now everyone and their dog does that. And so what's the new creative? How can people innovate within video when it's already, like, saturated with some of that stuff? Well, that's such a great point, Duramont. I mean, the the one thing, like you said, everybody and their dog does a whiteboard and marker. Not saying that's a bad way of doing it, but we always like to look at where you're using within your process. I personally really like the whole whiteboard and a marker for introductions. You're meeting a new stakeholder on the call, you wanna put a face to name before you jump online. Also, a really good reminder, maybe the day before your meeting, just to to kinda bump up that email or that meeting reminder as well. So some of the things that we really like to see people do is get creative. If you know, maybe just through your prospecting efforts as you're creeping somebody's LinkedIn profile, that they're really into water. I mean, I'm just bringing it up because, actually, one of one of the guys on my team right now, really likes different kinds of water from different areas of the world. So just random fun fact kind of thing. Right? Maybe you notice something different on their LinkedIn profile. Bring that out. Maybe show them draw them a picture. I know one of the clients that that I, work with out of support, they just became a unicorn last week. I drew them a unicorn on a whiteboard. That that video has over 30 views already within three days. Right? Another thing that I've always like to do is go through somebody's LinkedIn profile or company website. How can you be more personal than when you open an email and you see your face? Another great way to to kinda help personalize that outreach and it, again, doesn't have to be a whiteboard and a marker. Get creative with with how you're looking to actually communicate with people. So when someone opens your video whenever I see someone open my video and watch it but then don't respond, I usually ask them, was the video that bad? Do you have any do you have any tactics for when someone's opening your video 30 times and not responding to you? One of the best practices we like to talk about is after you send a video and you notice somebody's watched, maybe, like, 25% or more, that's obviously someone that's really engaged with what you said. And the the really nice thing with video is it's asynchronous. Right? It's not like you caught somebody on the phone. It's a little bit awkward. You're trying to force something out of them here. So we've always recommended wait five minutes for them to respond to you, tell them that you're interested, not interested, never talk to me again, then pick up the phone. So one of the things that Jacob Fernandez, who's one of the video coaches here at Vidyard, always talks about is you can play dumb. Pretend like it was just good luck. Saying, hey, Nick. It's Josh Kirkham from Vidyard. How you doing? Josh, I just watched your video. No way. What'd you think? Or you can call them out for the fact that, hey, Arman. It's Josh Kirkham from Vidyard. I I know you just had a chance to watch my video. Do you have two quick minutes? I'd love to hear your thoughts and share a couple examples. Right? So you can go under it two different ways. And it's obviously personality specific too, depending on what kind of sales rep you are and what kind of personality you have behind that, but even just who you're trying to reach out to as well. So I'm curious. Based on that follow-up, you're asking for feedback. What are you actually putting into your video knowing that it's goldfish attention span optimized? It's a lot of what our voice mails would be. Introduce yourself, say why you're reaching out, and then ask for a next step. Obviously, as we're we're looking to especially in a prospecting realm, using it. We understand that there's certain personas based on the industries or the verticals we're selling into that typically have certain pain points. I know with Vidyard, we're looking to maybe sales professionals. A lot of what people are hoping to solve was around meetings, pipeline, and revenue. It's pretty simple. Right? So being able to craft a message based on information like that is a fantastic way as an opener. Before you talk to somebody, you don't always know what they're trying to solve. So we always do have to be a little bit more generic, I guess, you can say from a prospecting lens. But then when you're asking what they thought, it's also easier to start diving into some of the things that actually started to resonate with that individual too. So can we talk about that segue? You've reached out to folks a couple times. You maybe called them, and they're finally willing to take a call with you. Right? When are you introducing video in the sales process? Are you doing it before they even meet with you? Are you doing it as a recap? What are the different anchor points that you can use video after prospecting? I've always recommended using it a couple different ways. I've always personally loved it as an introduction standpoint as well. Because if I reached out to Nick, sometimes it'll only be Nick and I in that first conversation, but sometimes maybe our moms will be joining as well. So So maybe a couple days before the meeting, because not everybody books for the very next day. Sending that meeting reminder, putting a face to name, reintroducing yourself, and using that as a way to almost set that upfront agenda of what that meeting is gonna be about. Setting expectations from there. And other than that, I've always loved using it after the call. So sending a recap. So saying, hey. These are the things we spoke about. Here are the actual takeaways. Or maybe depending on your process, because I know in Vidyard, we like to do disco demo pricing a lot in one call. So, generally, right after that first call, we're actually walking through a proposal we're sending off to that client and other follow-up resources, like micro demos and testimonies we're looking to showcase to. So I'd say before call, as part of your follow-up, because that way they can not only share it internally, but if they ghost you for six months and they start watching, pretty good way to understand to actually follow for them again. And even just later on in your sales cycle to ping somebody, walk through questions or concerns they have, or, again, if they have gone a little bit dark, you can get a little bit creative in terms of trying to get a response through that through that process as well. I wanna talk about this concept of micro demos because we had Tyler Lessard on the show, gosh, a couple months ago. And one of the things that I pulled out from there was, like, you can almost send a highlight reel to somebody after the fact. If I'm working with the managing partner of a law firm, that guy's not gonna sit through me just sending him the two hour demo recording of what we did. And so I wanna send, like, the high points. And I'm wondering if you can talk through sort of mechanically what goes into those micro demos. How do you actually like, what do you say in the email? How do you set them up? Are you sending links? Are you sending GIFs? Like, what's it look like? So you almost wanna have what are, like, the main one or two things you really want them to pay attention to. So maybe the the big thing you're trying to get for that managing partner at that law firm right after the meeting is that quick little three minute highlight reel of that two hour long meeting you have, but you even have some other case studies you wanna highlight as well. So what we always like to do is make that quick three minute video, basically going through potentially what the agenda was for that meeting so he they can at least get the recap of what everything was. What those two or three big points that maybe your stakeholder said, hey. These are really good things that I wanna be able to bring offline. Highlight those in the video, and then talk about maybe what the next steps are gonna be after that call. So that way, they can share it internally. Everybody in a three minute video, maybe four minute video gets a very good understanding of what happened on that meeting and what next steps are. So that can even help accelerate your deal velocity from there because that allows them to have more educated internal conversations after you've actually got off the call with them too. So that next call doesn't have to be recapping the first call. It can be actually progressing your deal from there too. Yeah. I mean, the other thing that I've been doing is if somebody asks me for, like, a case study that we've done with somebody, I I can send them the PDF. But what I've been doing recently is actually opening up the case study in a PDF and filming a video of me almost annotating it with my voice and pointing out areas that I think are particularly interesting. So instead of it just being like, yep. Here's a six page PDF. There's at least a little personality, and I can tailor the way that I describe what's in the case study to where I know the customer is interested. Yeah. Well, I think I almost was back, Nick, to what you're mentioning about that call recap. Right? If you're asking a a new stakeholder who maybe isn't a 100% invested in what we're doing yet to read a six minute case study on how you can help, that could be a daunting task for some people. Because as we know right now, people are in back to back meetings. They don't always have time. But if you send them a quick video recap of this is the the case study that I really think you'd enjoy, And here are the two or three parts that I think would be most beneficial to your team based on this conversation. They can take in what you say, and then if they really want to, you can actually dive in themselves and learn more. So you're almost, again, allowing that nice introduction and letting the rep do the selling. Especially, we're looking at champion selling. So maybe I'm working with Nick. Nick's such a big believer in how he could use this solution in his law firm. But now how am I gonna help arm Nick properly to play that game of broken telephone internally? So Nick has just told me the the two or three things that Armand, the decision maker, really cares about. How can I best arm Nick for that conversation with Armand? I can give him a couple points on what he probably cares about and how we can help. But on top of that, I can I can personally tell Nick or tell Arman through this Thrive exactly how we can help, maybe even showing a bit of that solution too? So all Nick has to say is, hey, Arman. I think this is really cool because of x y z, but here's the individual who's actually speaking to you. He also knows this product a lot better than I do. And so it allows your champion to internally sell much more efficiently, and it takes a lot off of their plate because we all understand the easiest way to sell something internally is to do a lot of that work for our champions. So if we can help do that by literally presenting it for them, we're just gonna make their life easier, but it's also gonna help them be more efficient selling internally too. Josh, can you talk us through, like, mechanics of of angle, lighting, stuff like that so folks don't look as creepy as Nick and Arman did when they started? Well, I think we've all been there. I mean, I I'm pretty sure and maybe just for fun, I'll I'll actually send you guys my first prospecting day when I started Vidyard. It was pretty funny. I remember looking back on that back on that a little bit ago. But I think it's it's not just, how your camera and lighting are when you're looking to use something like a a video or Vidyard, but it's just a virtual selling etiquette. Right? Nobody wants to look up somebody's nose. Nobody wants to talk to somebody that's in a dark cringy room. I personally, maybe I'm just as me, but I think that's almost common sense for a lot of this. So we wanna say that that's the same way as you're looking to communicate. If you're in person with somebody, you'd always be looking at eye level. You'd probably be dressed somewhat professionally. Right? And your background would just be decent. Right? You don't not a messy bed. Nothing crazy going on behind you. Just professional. And the really nice thing with this is it can be as professional as your audience is. If you're selling to law firms, you should probably be wearing a shirt and a tie. If you're selling to tech companies, you could probably get away with a t shirt. Right? So be as professionals of people that you're gonna be reaching out to. And from there, I'd just make sure you're not backlit, just so you're not dark. So make sure the light's in front of you. I know a best practice we've always heard is putting your camera, your laptop camera in a windowsill so you have that nice natural light to you. Make sure it's eye level. And when you're speaking, make sure you're looking at the camera. One of the the worst things you can do in my opinion, and not just in a virtual selling tone, is when you're looking somewhere else, it feels like you're not speaking to that person. If you're speaking to somebody in real life, face to face one day when we could do that, you'd be looking in the eyes. And And so if you're looking either at your camera or just below it, it has that illusion that you're actually looking directly at Arman while we're actually having this conversation. And it's no different as you're looking to use video as well. So in kind of Cole's notes there, make sure that you're front lit, so, like, the light's shining towards your face. The camera's eye level, so nobody's looking up your nose. Make sure that you're somewhat professionally dressed so your background is in that sense too. And then from there, just smile and have a good time. Nick is more of the he he really enjoys looking up people's noses. I think you might got it wrong, Josh. There is one person in the world who loves it. Alright. So we have our correct video setup going on here. The other thing working our way backwards is you talked about doing this video blitz thing. Right? And so you're recording, I don't know, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, 50 videos. And let's talk about how this fits into the broader prospecting workflow. Knowing that Vidyard folks are probably, like, the most proficient video users, are you sending a single prospect multiple videos? Are you sending them one? When do you start to see some of the diminishing returns and just go with the blocking and tackling of email and phone? There's a a lot of really cool things we've done with this. So I can actually go through one that that video blitz, and then I can even talk about video within, like, a cadence or a sequence depending on what solution you're using too because I think those are very, very cool things with it. So the one thing that that we've always recommended to people, and we almost like to talk about it like we're cold calling. If you were calling, would you call one person, then write 2 emails, then check LinkedIn, then call again? It'd be pretty hard to do that traditional smile and dial a 100 dials a day. There's no different. Right? You wanna do everything you're doing in bulk. If you're making a video, then you're leaving, then you're doing something else, it'll take you a long time to actually talk to the people you're trying to get in front of. But like I said, this should be like a voice mail. Forty five seconds to a minute. So make sure we're, one, we're being efficient with that. And two, the other secret we're doing it in those blitzes is trying to be a one take wonder. It doesn't take a lot of time to make a video unless you have to do it five times. Then that one video took five minutes or that one voice mail took five minutes. Do it once. Again, it doesn't have to be perfect. If you stumble a little bit, it's all good. If you drop an f bomb or you absolutely destroy your pitch, yeah, probably redo that one. But it's okay to be human. It's okay to stumble. I can tell you the number of times where I've literally said, wow. That wasn't English. Let me try that again. And I just keep going. People want to deal with humans. That's why teams like Gong have actually found that, like, by turning your video on, it's actually gonna increase your win rate by a 127. Why not do that everywhere else? People wanna deal with humans within that process. That's perfect because I think about when I started as a new video seller, like, I would put my dress shirt on, trim my nose hair, film a video or two, but the area I screwed up so much was, like, I would make a mistake. And then instead of refilming it, I would, like, get discouraged, get a drink of water, come back, and then, like, refilm it again, but then I forgot what I was doing. And so we talked a lot about the idea of time blocking or batching where it's like, if you're gonna make 50 cold calls and send fifty fifty videos, don't alternate between the two. Do 50 of one task, do 50 of another, move on to your email, move on to your research, live your day out of tasks and events on your calendar. People screw up video because they they'll record, like, one, And they'll spend twenty minutes recording one, and they, like, fiddle with their lighting, and it looks really bad. And they rerecord it seven times, and they send it off. And then the prospect doesn't respond because it's, like, the only video they've ever sent, and they're not very good at it yet. Versus you have to send twenty one minute videos in an hour, have a quick three minute break in between each. You can get through 20 prospects in a full hour. Just use whatever lines that Josh used or my personal favorite one is like, well, you're definitely not gonna book a demo now because I screwed that one up, but we'll keep going. Have fun with it. Keep rolling with the punches. Alright? So the last thing, Josh, is you wanted to talk about how this weaves into a sequence. Right? Can you tell us how that starts to be structured in your workflow? Absolutely. One of the things that we've always recommended as a first step is actually using LinkedIn. It's a great way to put a face to the name, so when they recognize you before your face pops up in their email, but they actually know that you're a real person from a real company, Tim. And that's, I think, across any industry, whether that's sales, marketing, IT professionals, whatever that is too, we are very big believers in a multi pronged approach. From there, it's either the second or third step that we definitely recommend to add a video. Put a face to the name, add your pitch and why you're reaching out. From there, as you're doing your call steps, you can start to relate back to that video in the email you sent over. And you can use that as the excuse to why you're reaching out to that person in the end because you noticed they haven't watched it. Or when they do watch it, that's the exact reason why you're reaching out to them too. And one of the really big things that we've seen a lot of success with here at Vidyard is actually something called the second first touch. So we'll send somebody, an email with a video in it in our second step on the first day. And then probably about halfway through our our cadence, we actually will send the exact same video. We'll just change the subject line and the initial hook for the first sentence. And but we repurpose that same video. And we actually find it has the same conversion rate even later on within our sequence as the very first step does. So it's a really powerful way to not create more work for yourself and just repurpose things you've already used in the past here. I love that. So, Josh, you told us a story earlier about a deal that had gone dark. And I'm getting a little worried because we had someone else on here who talked about playing a musical instrument to bring a deal in. And we gotta hear your story, man. Going into the end of the the month in December, got a verbal from a client and heard, hey. It'll be two weeks. The sign will be back from vacation, and we'll be good to send the contract and go. Two weeks came, two weeks went, didn't hear from anything. Calling them, following up, using negative questions as a way to try to drive some sort of response and couldn't get anything. So what I did is I pulled out a guitar. I sang a song on the spot while obviously recording with a video, and I sent it to them over LinkedIn as a direct message. I not only got a response within an hour, but the deal actually revived and closed within twelve hours. And it was pretty funny in my opinion, but it's the response I got from the client was even better, because it was one that just went viral internally. The signer thought it was hilarious and said, hey. Sorry for ghosting you for so long. We were dealing with x, y, and z. We're good to go. Here's everything you need. Send it on over. And it was a fantastic way to build the relationship, but also just obviously helping that deal across the line too. Maybe another day, I'll, I'll follow-up, to you guys personally, and you can you can see the song yourself. I love it. So I got one last thing before we wrap up here. You've mentioned it a couple times where when you're dealing with a gone dark deal, you're using, like, negative questions. I know this is a little bit less related to video, but could you talk us through what a negative question is and how you use those? No. That's a great point. And I actually got the idea from, one of my fellow sales managers here, at Vidyard, Ryan Frampton, where as you're looking to pull out risk in in your deals, use a negative question to drive that response. So if you're going to the end of your deal and you're pulling at risk at the end of your sale asking who you need to talk to, like, who the stakeholders are and when do you talk with them, what are some concerns they might have? If they were supposed to follow-up with you in two weeks or they're supposed to have the meeting with you in two weeks and for one reason or another, again, it just had to push or something didn't happen. Being able to use a negative question like, hey. Did x y z stakeholder say no? Or have you given up on this project? Or is this no longer on your radar? As a way to help drive that response, it's actually been a really big thing we've seen here at Vidyard as well. So not just asking, hey, Nick. Are you still interested in this? But saying, hey, Nick. Is this not something you wanna do anymore? Has been a pretty great way that we've actually seen across the team, to be able to better align with our deals, bring people back into our sales, or if they're just not interested, it's totally cool. That way we can actually push them out of our funnel, stop annoying them, and actually get on to the individuals who are are more interested in furthering the conversations there too. We hear this a lot where your job as a rep is to constantly, constantly push away and disqualify. And it's not like you're gonna be an arrogant jerk where you're doing band for every single deal, but your job is when someone goes dark to make it as easy as possible for them to tell you the truth. And if you keep saying, are you interested? Are you interested? Do you wanna move forward with Vidyard? Do you wanna move forward with thirty minutes to president's club? It never freaking gets you anywhere. So I totally agree with you, man. The only other point I wanna add to that is it's not necessarily just when they've gone dark. I ask what you would call a negative question all the time with deals that, like, I'm having good conversations with in the sense of, like, hey. There's a lot of really good options out there. Like, why would you go with thirty minutes to president's club? Like, the idea is the best salespeople aren't afraid to know where they stand. And so sometimes you need to ask questions where it's like, what risks are out there around this deal coming in? Because you wanna know about those things, and you actually come across as a much more balanced, thoughtful, and unbiased salesperson when you're not just like, rah rah rah, vidyard. Like, we're the only solution to possibly help you around this. So I love that you're asking those, Josh. And I also love this interview, but we gotta move to the final question now. So we talked about a ton of great things salespeople should be doing, especially around video. We gotta talk about a bad habit now. So the last question for you is, what's a bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to stop exhibiting and dump in the trash because it hurts more than it helps. The one bad habit that love for other salespeople to break, and I actually got this from, one of my own managers, Evan Santa, was never negotiate over email. If you're talking about terms of service, if you're talking about anything contract related, deal size, or asking for a discount, pick up the phone, have a conversation with them. The phone is not dead. The phone is a fantastic resource to get an instant response. So if somebody's looking to negotiate with you or have a conversation that probably shouldn't be hand over email because they'll probably ghost at the end, pick up the phone, have that conversation. Don't just take the easy way out and send the email hoping for the best. Beautiful. Josh, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? If you've never tried Vidyard, download the free version, check it out. I gotta have the shameless plug for the for the product here. But it was a pleasure being on thirty minutes of presence club. We've listened to this a ton as as I was getting started in sales here, so great to come round trip here as well. So thank you very much for having me. Well, we really appreciate you coming on. And listen, folks, if you're listening to the show, we've had a lot of episodes about video, and Vidyard has been a huge supporter of thirty minutes to presidents club. There's a link to try Vidyard in the show notes, but even cooler is there's a video playbook that Armand and I filmed together that you can only get if you click on the link in the show notes. So check that out, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Josh Kirkham include, number one, be a one take wonder. Do not re repeat your videos 17,000 times. One take, sixty seconds. Number two, preview videos before your demo calls. Go and introduce yourself, get all the pleasantries out before your discovery call, and send them a one or two minute video giving them an overview of what you do and what you're gonna cover in that call. Number three, after the calls, you can use micro demos as a follow-up. Hey. Here were the three main points we had. Hey. You had a question about this. Here's how that would work inside of your software. And then lastly, number four, if someone watches your video, call them or even ask them, hey. Was the video that bad? Alrighty, Nick. Where can people help us? Armand, you and I filmed a very special episode where we talk through our best practices for video, but you can't listen to that episode on your podcast listening app. The only way to find that episode is to go into the show notes, and we got a little link there. And if you click on that link, we'll take you to the video playbook. Thanks for listening. We'll see you guys next week.
