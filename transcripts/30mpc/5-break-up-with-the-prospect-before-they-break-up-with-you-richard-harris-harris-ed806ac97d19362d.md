## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farrokhin. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. How are we doing, my man? I am doing fantastic, Arman. We got a great show today. How are you? Fantastic. We're coming in hot with Richard Harris, the one and only CEO and president of Harris Consulting. He's trained tons and tons of SaaS sales teams all over the Silicon Valley. He's also the host of the Surf and Sales podcast with Scott Lease. Nick, why the heck should people listen to this episode? Couple reasons. One, Richard's got this really effective strategy called the contract, which in my opinion is one of the best ways that you can kick off a good meeting. He also shared a lot of really tactical strategies to stop chasing maybes, which frankly and this is his words. The number one way to break the will and spirit of a human being is to chase maybes. This was a great episode. I'm excited to get into it. Fantastic. Let's roll the tape. Three, two, one. Go live. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel.

You know we start every single episode with three actionable tips, so let's get yours. Yeah. No worries. Thank you guys for having me. I I really appreciate it. It means a lot. So action tip number one, how to handle send me an email. Right? That dreaded email request. Cool. We'll talk about that one. What's number two? Number two, question behind the question. Right? When someone asks you a question, what do you do? That's the second one. And the third one, open and closed into questions, really understanding what they are beyond yes or no. Love it. We were talking about that number three on the prep call that we were doing for this, and I'm really excited to dig into that. So if I'm a listener right now, I'm definitely like, okay. How do I handle that? Send me an email objection or response. Can we talk about that? Can you give me give me what that looks like? The first place I would say is that you need to be able to ask someone, hey. Great. I can send you a thousand emails. Right? I can blow up your inbox, but what do you really wanna see? Right? So I can send you the right thing. The other thing, and this is actually what I like to say before that, is to say, hey, Nick. I'm gonna send you an email, and you do know that that means I have to keep emailing and calling for the next several weeks. Right? Like, you know that's gonna happen. So before you ask me to send an email, do you really want me to do that? Because if you're just trying to be nice, that's cool. I get it, but I don't wanna bug you. And then when they say, no, Richard. I really want you to send an email, then I'll I'll say, great. What do you wanna see? What do you wanna talk about? Like, I'm happy to send that. And then the third part is to say, after I send this, can I ask you for time on the calendar now, or should I wait? Don't forget to ask what you really need, which is that next meeting. Right? We always forget that. We always take the this is an inmate. Send me an email. Send me some information. But we never ask for the most important part, which is great. After you get it and after you review it, can we then have a meeting? Because and granted, most people are gonna say no, but it's more about you exercising the muscle to ask for the meeting, which is the real purpose of how you handle how do you send me an email. That's really nice. There's a ton of gold that we can pull out of there. Like, one of the big ones is you're getting to the heart of whether or not they're actually interested in talking with you. Because if they want, they are actually interested in an email. Like, they'll give you more detail, and it helps you do a better job. And if they're not, you figure that out also. And a lot of times a rep hears, hey. Send me an email, and that's kind of a win, and they stop. But you've gotta finish the job. That's not even any kind of a win. Send me an email is not a kind of a win. Right? Send me an email is giving you a maybe. I want yeses and nos. I don't do maybes. Nothing will exhaust the spirit and will of any human being more than chasing maybes. I don't care if it's in sales. I don't care if it's in marketing. I don't care if it's, in dating. Don't chase maybes. One of my best SDRs will do something similar where he'll say, I I know you want me to send you an email. Do you mind if I ask you a really honest question first? And the prospect will say yes, and he'll say, usually, when people tell me they wanna see an email, they're honestly just politely telling me to go away. Is that what's happening here? And you get people to open up, and you get the real answer that you're looking for. So, Richard okay. So we've gotten that person. We've sent them an email. Now they've said, hey. Actually, I do wanna talk with you. You were sharing some really interesting things with us before about the question behind the question. And something I'm excited to dig in with you a little bit about is, like, having really effective discovery and not just getting the things on a checklist, but, like, actually understanding what's going on there. So can you talk a little bit about what your discovery or qualification calls look like? Yeah. So I just came up with this. You made me think hard about it, is that we think in pictures, but we speak in words. That's the challenge. So when people ask us a question, there's a picture in their head, and oftentimes, the words they're using don't align with the picture. Right? So it can be something like, hey, Richard. How do you compare to this particular trainer? Well, I and a lot of salespeople, we go into panic mode of, oh my god. They're talking to someone else. It's my competitor. Oh my god. Oh my gosh. When in fact, I said, oh, well, here's how I do that. But just out of curiosity, Armand, what makes you ask about them in the first place? And what Arman says is way more important than the question he asked me. Because you'll get things like, oh, well, we're talking to them, and we had a really good conversation. Well, as much as that stings, at least I wanna know. Right? We said, at least I can now have an honest conversation about it. Right? If it goes dark or I lose it, I know. Right? Armand might turn around and say, you know what? We just had a conversation with someone, so it went terrible. Oh, well, doesn't happen all the time, but that does happen. I I get that response. So the goal of question behind the question is to get people to paint the picture in their head that made them ask you the question. I mean, it matters what they ask, but it kinda doesn't until you understand the picture. That was really helpful. They ask you a question and you say, well, I'm happy to answer that. Do you mind if I ask why you asked that question? Like, what's coming out of your mouth when they ask you a question that you feel like you might need to get behind? People will say, hey. Can your product or service do this? Right? And it's it's that moment where you're like, oh my god. My competitor does that way better than us. But this is how you use question behind the question, and that is to be able to say, hey, Nick. Actually, our product doesn't do that. But just so I understand, how important is that for you to make this decision? Because that's what I really need to know. I'm not trying to go head to head against my competitor. I'm trying to go head to head against the picture that's in Nick's head. So let's say there's not a question to ask the question behind the question with. Let's say you're just kicking off the discovery call. You've set some sort of agenda. And the third point that you talked about is open versus closed ended questions. How do you start to pry the prospect open in a way that's a a little bit more than, like, tell me about your priorities, which is the most generic, tell me about your business in the next x number of years. There's a thing that I teach called the respect contract about how you open a conversation in a first scheduled meeting. You confirm time, goals, outcome, potential outcomes, asking for the no, creating a mini contract, and then you have a transition statement. So this is how I teach everybody more or less to do what I do, and it works all the time, is to say, hey. So just role play with me, Nick. Hey, Nick. It's Richard. How you doing? Hey, Richard. It's nice to talk with you. Likewise. Hey. I got us down for thirty minutes. Does that still work? Thirty minutes works, but I have a hard stop. I gotta talk with my buddy, Armand, after. So, yeah. We got till four here. No problem. So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna set a timer at twenty five minutes, and we're just gonna call a time out no matter where we are and just assess where we're at. Does that work for you? Yeah. That's fair. We can do that. Excellent. So and just so you know, Nick, my only goal of this conversation, I just wanna get a mutual frame of reference about what you're up to. I wanna understand what you're looking for in terms of sales and sales training in your world, ask you some questions. Certainly want you to ask me any questions, explain what I do, and and let me know if there's something specific you wanna talk about. Anything particular you wanna talk about on the agenda today? Yeah. You know, I was reading a blog post of yours about great discovery questions, and I wanna make sure that we dig into that because that's something the team's having a lot of trouble with. Great. So we'll talk about that. So thank you for sharing that. And then and and the one thing I want you to know, Nick, look. The last thing either one of us need to do is waste each other's time. So if at any point you feel like I'm not the right guy, please say so. I promise you won't offend me. Likewise, if I discover I don't think I can help you, I'll say so. Not only that, but I once I understand what you're looking for, if it's not me, I'll be the first to recommend you to somebody else because a lot of us know each other in the world, and we know our swim lanes, and we know where our strengths are, and we know where other people are stronger. So I just wanna make sure that we can have a really nice open dialogue. Is that fair? That sounds fair to me. I appreciate that, Richard. Thank you. That That way I don't have to send reaching out and checking in and touching base emails that I know you hate getting and I hate sending. What you're doing at the beginning of the meeting is you can't have your customer bring the walls down and actually have an honest conversation with somebody. If they're thinking about, okay, does this guy know I've got a hard stop at thirty minutes? Or, like, confirming the time and the logistics and all of those things at the outset are expected. Like, and even the thing where you you talk about ending five minutes early, you get all of that out in front, and then it brings down everybody's walls because you've taken care of all of the blocking and tackling and logistics, and then you can just have the conversation. Otherwise, you're getting interrupted twenty two minutes in when you're on a great great riff where you're having a conversation with a customer and like, oh, hey. By the way, I gotta go in eight minutes. You take care of all of that in the beginning. The five minute time out is designed and I literally will set my phone on a timer, and I will leave it on and I will let the customer hear it or the prospect. Because if we are in those good conversations, it's like, oh my god. Where did twenty five minutes go? And that emotion is what you're trying to capture. Right? And you'd be surprised how often people will be like, oh, we can go an extra five minutes. Let let's go a little bit longer. Right? But what I'm really trying to avoid is the, hey, Nick. This has been a great conversation. I know you gotta go. By the way, can I call you next week? What I don't want Nick to do is say, just email me on Monday. We'll set up a time next week. Because lord knows that turns into two more weeks. That's not what I want to happen. And so that five minute makes me stop. Why don't we go over to when it comes to you finished up your discovery. What does the recap of that discovery look like? And then how do you transition into commercial terms if you're talking about price in that call? So first thing is I always teach people to change that word price, budget, money, any of those things to the phrase commercial terms. Let's test you, Armand. This is the test in front of your sales team. K. Why do I need to use the word commercial terms and not the word price or budget? Alright. Putting me on the spot. So the first thing is that the mental red flags behind price. The second thing is commercial terms can be a lot of different things. It can be, payment terms. It can be different durations. It could be invoicing. And so how do you know that price is the issue? A lot of times, we'll push discount when it's actually timing that's the issue. Or yes and yes and. It has a lot to do with there's a negotiation that's implied. It means price, for whatever reason, and maybe it's me, and I think it's other people. As soon as we hear that in a sales conversation these days, our customers or our prospects are trying to commoditize us. Remember, they're thinking in pictures, but speaking in words. They're going, oh, in their head, they're going Richard versus Sandler versus Miller Hyman versus Medic. Right? Which now means I'm gonna be commoditized against all of them. Commercial terms means there's something way more to this conversation than just a number and a dollar sign. I was gonna say I use that in a lot of other terms too, Richard. It's not just about commercial terms, but when people start delivering, I'll just say it now, price, sometimes you have different tiers of service. And people will refer to them as which package do you want. And it's like, do you want the the Happy Meal? Do you want the Big Mac or fries? Do you want the Pepsi on the side? Don't call it a package or a or a all in one solution. You're tailoring what you're offering them from a service standpoint based on their specific problems. You basically explain these are the problems that we're gonna solve. When you're gonna walk into that commercial terms conversation, you should define what those elements are. Hey. We're gonna talk about commercials. And by the way, just so we're on the same page, yes, we're gonna talk about dollars and cents. We're gonna talk about the legal process. We're gonna talk about an onboarding process, payment terms, and then timeline related to all of this. That's what your commercial terms are. So when you actually gotta talk about dollars and cents, you have perspective on how you should actually say and give What is that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's all about the f word of sales called feelings. Every single thing we buy in the world has a feeling associated with the dollars. Right? So the way I suggest people to do this is to say, hey, Nick. Based on what we talked about, we're gonna do two days of training. Cost for that's gonna be $24,000. How does that feel? And so, normally, I would wait for Nick to answer that. Oh, I didn't know if you wanted me to answer that. It's alright. It's okay. Because people will say things that matter. Like, if you say, how does that align with the budget? Are you comfortable with that price? First of all, they've been trained and conditioned to not answer those questions. Right? Oh, it's a little high. Right? I'm always gonna say. Yes. But I would much rather say, how does that feel and have them say it feels a little high. Because now when I say compared to what, there's a feeling of what number were you feeling is a good number. You get honest emotional responses that work really well that lets you know. Like, I have people go, that feels about right. Alright? About right's good. Okay. I have other people say, oh, that feels right in line with our budget. Like, they don't even realize they just told me that was the budget. I've had people say, wow. That feels less than I expected. Of course, then I'm shooting myself in the head going, oh my god. I'm not putting on the table. And I've had people go, no. That feel that feels a little expensive. And I'm like, okay. Well, let's let's talk about that. Like, what were your expectations coming in? Not what budget do you have. What were your expectations? Because expectations are an emotion and a feeling, so it's all about feeling. The worst advice that I ever hear, and I still hear it sometimes, is that I was told to give pricing and then shut up and just wait for an answer. And it's kinda like, why? Like, are you Nostradamus? Like, you can determine what really is happening in the silence. We could probably talk about this stuff all day, Richard. I think it's time we move to our last question. Alright. So, Richard, this has been awesome. We've talked about a lot of the good habits, but there are a ton of bad habits out there too. And we see things that should stop happening immediately in the sales floor. And so if there's one thing that every sales rep needs to stop doing right away to be more successful, what would that one bad habit to break be? To stop saying, does that make sense? Because it's a terrible question. There's probably one or two percents where it makes sense. What I want you to say instead or what I encourage people to say is, hey. Now that I've explained that, how does this compare to your current process? How does this compare to is this better than what you were doing before? Because that's what I need to know. I don't need to know if it makes sense. I need to know if it's better or worse or the same. So, Richard, this was a fantastic time. And so everybody hold on because we have a ton of actionable takeaways to go through in the recap email that's gonna be sixty seconds long in three, two, one. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, everybody. Here are our top four takeaways for the episode with Richard Harris. The first is that you should set a timer that goes off twenty five minutes into your thirty minute call. It forces you to have five minutes to discuss next steps. Have it audibly go off. The second is when they say send me an email, you gotta be disarmingly blunt. You gotta say, hey. If I send you an email, that means I gotta keep calling you and emailing you over the next couple of weeks. And so do you really want me to send you that email, or can we just have an open and honest conversation? The third point is that there's the question behind the question. Whenever somebody asks you for how you differ from a certain competitor or how you integrate with x solution, understand the use case, understand why they're asking that question. Are they looking at the competitor? What does that actually mean? And then the last fourth takeaway is phrase your pricing conversations around commercial terms instead of price. Do not use the word price. The reason is that it means a lot more than dollars. Commercial terms could include the terms of service. It could be payment terms. It could be things that come up in red lines. It could be invoicing type of policies. And so make sure that you talk about commercial terms in a holistic view of the deal.
