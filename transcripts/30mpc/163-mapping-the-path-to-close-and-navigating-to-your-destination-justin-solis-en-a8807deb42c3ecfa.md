## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have mister Smooth, the storyteller himself. It's the one and only mister Justin Solis from my very own PAVE. Nick, why should people listen? One of the most frustrating things as a salesperson is when your call falls off track and gets into the weeds or your deal falls off track and gets into the weeds. And I think Justin does a really great job keeping calls on track and on focus and keeping your deal from going all over the place where you've done 432 demos to all sorts of random people or you don't even know where you're trying to get to in your deal, Justin does a very good job mapping the path and then navigating to the end destination. And three, two, one. Welcome to the end destination. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Justin. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Alright. So number one is use bucket questions and typically statements, to get your prospect to be able to go deeper on the problems. Right? So oftentimes, like, I'll start a call and I'll ask, hey. Why are you on this call? And they'll give me something super surface level. Like, we wanna scale our systems more effectively. So a really great way to prod at that without seeming like, you know, you're in doing the great inquisition is just to say, hey. Like, typically, when folks tell me that they're looking to scale, either they've got something that happened that led them to realize that their systems don't work today or they just got some extra time on their hands. Which camp do you fall in? And then whether I've guessed right or wrong, it's gonna force them to actually go deeper on the problem and help me get more information in that discovery. Very nice. What's number two? So number two is make up a story bank for the product features that are the real stars of your product. So oftentimes, a lot of the things that you're gonna do, a lot of other products will do as well. So what's important is to understand what are the things that differentiate you, and what are the things that you learn from your discovery that are gonna matter to your prospect. And then when you're telling talking about those things, to accentuate them, you wanna tell stories. And oftentimes, it's difficult to think about stories on the fly. And so to help yourself, go through and figure out what are the stories that you can use that correlate to each of those specific different features or things that you wanna call out so that you've got a bank of stories that you can weave together. Beautiful. Round us out, Justin. What's number three? Know who you wanna speak with beforehand. This is a lesson that I learned the hard way. A lot of times prepping for calls, I might have an idea of, like, who's on the call with me and what they do or maybe just their boss. But I like to know the entire hierarchy of this team and the adjacent teams as well and know everyone's names going into the call. And then when relevant problems come up in discovery or in the demo, I might even name drop that person. Right? So that way I'm weaving them into the conversation well before we get to the end. And by the time I'm asking for their involvement, we're we're gonna be talking about them by name already instead of trying to, like, say, hey. Can you bring in your boss or manager to this at the end? So, Justin, let's go back to number two. A lot of times when you see reps demoing for the first time, they demo in features or in clicks or in buttons. They demo in terms of you can see all of this manager's direct reports or you can add all of these fields to a dashboard. How should you be describing or cutting up your demo instead that makes it a little bit more real for the prospect. And if you want, you can use an example if it's easier. Yeah. For sure. So, I mean, at Pave, we have a number of different user profiles that you can log into when you're demoing. And the first thing that I do when I get into the demo is I set the scene. I am looking at this environment from the perspective of Yana Douglas. She is the CTO of this fictional organization. And then I'm gonna start talking about what she sees, and I'm gonna talking about what she cares about. Or, hey. You've probably seen this problem before. Right? And so what I can start doing is basically showing everything from perspective of a specific user. And when you know the product well and you know the pains from discovery, you can pause at certain areas of your story, and that will invite them to tell their own stories. Right? And so talking about how they would use it, or talking about their perspectives in previous scenarios. Justin, you were talking about you're starting this demo by orienting yourself as Yana Douglas, but then you're weaving in what you learned in discovery and trying to also create space for them to share their own stories. Can you talk about how you weave in what they shared in discovery into your demo talk tracks? Yeah. So, generally, what I'll do is going into that demo call, I have, like, some solid bullet points. In fact, something that we do often at Pave is before we even start the demo is going over the main pain points that I've discovered and then opening up the room for other people to elaborate on those. And so I've got those bullet points to the side. And so in my head, just because I know the product well, I know where each one of those panes corresponds to specific product feature. For example, when people talk about they don't have any insight into historical pay, I'll start telling my story of Mianna Douglas. And right when I get to the pipe where we can show the entire history of someone's compensation, not just their last comp adjustment, I'm gonna pause here, and I'm gonna say, hey, hey, Susan. You mentioned that this is something that you really have difficulty with today. Tell me again how that works now. Okay. Great. And so this is how it would look in paid. You know what I mean? And so that way, we're really just twisting the knife, and I'll try to do that periodically throughout the demo and try to make sure that I'm addressing each person who said what they said. So I'll generally have the pain that was given and who said it so that I can weave it back in. So what you're doing is you have these standardized stories and these standardized demo flows that you identified at the beginning where you know if you show historical pay or if you're showing dashboards or what have you, you have your stock story for that. But then what you're doing is you're using the questions to insert what you learn in discovery. So you're giving your own stock story, but then you're saying, by the way, on our last call, you mentioned that that story that I just told was something that was pretty similar to what your experience. How does this align with the solution that you had in mind? And that's how you're getting your stories to match up with their stories. Is that correct? Exactly. Right? And stories come in a few different flavors. You have what I just described, which is, like, me actually in the product coming from the user perspective. Another really powerful thing to do, particularly when you're trying to highlight a pain that maybe a certain prospect in the room doesn't see, is to actually talk about an end user perspective. Right? So I'm lucky at Pave that, like, when we sell the total rewards portal, the end user is me. I am an employee who needs to understand their comp. And so oftentimes, when I'm a see something, I may not realize how prevalent the lack of understanding around equity is within my organization. And so I might see something that highlights how we can explain equity and think this is not a problem. So what I'll do is I'll tell a story from my perspective. Armand knows this story very well. I used to work at Segment, and when I worked there, I left for a 20 base bump just before I hit my my cliff. And then a few months later, they were acquired by Twilio. I missed out on a 6 figure payday, and I never even occurred to me as a reason to stay. Right? And so by being able to explain the pain from the end user, it really illuminates the fact that, like, wow. There's probably a whole class of people in my organization I've never thought of that are quitting and leaving, and I have no idea why. So, Justin, so far, you've told some stories. You've asked some questions to understand if what you're showing is resonating. And sometimes, they'll give you the answer that's like, oh, yeah. It totally is, and they'll share a story. But then other times, they'll be like, oh, yeah. This is but can I do this? Can I do this? Can I do this? And then all of a sudden, they start to drag you less into, does this solve my problem and more into, can I make sure that it perfectly fits into the box? And so how do you keep people on that first demo out of the weeds and focused on, yes, I can solve your problem before you do the whole technical validation thing? For sure. I'd say there's a couple ways that this can go. My first gut reaction when someone tries to take me into the weeds is I wanna understand why is this important to you. Because very often, when someone tells you why they wanna configure something a certain way, particularly with our product, when we do a lot of the things that happen in spreadsheets, but the way that you skin the cat is vastly different. And so understanding, like, what that you're looking to achieve and then rewinding and saying, see that all the time. That makes total sense that you wanna make that happen. Here's how that actually works in paid. Way easier. And so that is the best case scenario. As we all know, that doesn't always work that way. Sometimes people don't even know why. They just wanna see it for whatever reason. And so then, I'll take it another way, which is I will say, hey. You know what? That's a really great question. Honestly, definitely something that I'm gonna write a note of, minimize the screen, hear the click clack so they know I'm writing it down, and say, let's go ahead and make sure that we talk about this with our sales engineer on the next call, or I will humble myself and say, you know what? I've never gotten that question before. That is, like, a highly technical question, and I'm gonna definitely save that for when we have our sales engineer on this call. So make them feel like a genius or let them know that, like, hey. This is gonna be something we'll talk about the next call to get them to go to the next call. Or best case scenario is, like, find out what the real reason and actually show them there's other ways of thinking about this. So what you're doing when they ask you for, like, this really niche situation, what you're not doing is trying to, like, address it or jerry rig your product to do the weird thing that they're asking. What you are doing is you're saying, like, what's the intent of what you're trying to solve for? What's the outcome that you're looking here? Because your product likely has a way to help with it. It might not be the specific path that they suggested because you're keeping in mind that they have a limited view of the world. But when you understand where they're trying to get to, you're then able to say, well, we don't do it the way that you asked, but we actually do help with that problem. Here's how we do it. I've often found that, like, sometimes the people who keep bringing those questions up again and again and again, like, I don't wanna be insulting anybody, but, like, sometimes the people that you're demoing to are just on different paces. Like, if somebody was showing a demo to me and Armand, I would get it right away, and Mickey might have 572 different questions. Like, in that scenario, when the people you're talking to just, like, they're going at different paces, how do you handle a situation like that? Because you don't want to bore the person who's, like, getting to it faster, but you also don't wanna neglect the other person. I think oftentimes, it has to do with level setting. Right? Like, when I'm in that scenario where I have, like, an above the line person whose their needs are being met, they're seeing what's happening, and I have this below the line person who's trying to dig us back into the weeds, I say, look. Like, we've got thirty minutes left on the clock. In the interest of time, like, I would love to follow-up with you these things asynchronously. And I'm I'm sure there's actually a million more technical questions that you're gonna have. And what I would love is if you can just put those in writing for me, and I'm gonna follow-up with you on those. But I wanna make sure that we're able to get through all the other things that you said were important, dangle one of those things that then so we can move on to the next topic. And then everyone understands I'm not being rude. It's in the best interest of everyone here because these are things that you wanna see and I wanna show you. I think one other thing that I've seen that works well in this scenario is a lot of people, they almost try to put the hush on the technical people. And it actually frustrates them, and those people end up being the deal blockers. But I find that if you actually lean into those people and compliment them and say, holy cow. You know your stuff on comp. Today is really gonna be the high level demo. What I'd love to do is you know your stuff. Can I put you with someone who can really level and, like, get on your level? Because you're, like, way more technical than most people that we talk to, and I wanna make sure that you feel comfortable with this. And I just know we're not gonna get to that level today. And so instead of it being this thing, like, you're asking too many in the weeds questions, etcetera, you can actually lean into it and compliment them on the fact that they're getting in the weeds and use that to push them onto a separate call entirely. So, Justin, let's say that you get to the end of this call, and it's been an awesome demo. They're going back and forth on the stories. They're smiling. They're laughing. They're crying. They're with you the whole way. You eventually stop the screen share. What do you do once you stop the screen share to wrap this call up? So I normally end the screen share, and I'd say, like, you know, love to hear what everybody thought, you know, and maybe bring up a few specific things. Right? And then, essentially, once I get that buy in that it's a yes, my goal from here is to find out, okay. Like, do you wanna buy Pave? We've answered that question. How do you wanna buy Pave, and when do you wanna buy Pave? Right? And that's essentially it. You can't ask those questions just outright like that, but, essentially, you know, trying to understand where do we go from here. So let's break that down a little bit more. If we start with that first question, my guess is you're not you're not just asking, do you wanna buy? When do you wanna buy? How how do you buy? Right? Let's talk about that first question of, do you wanna buy Pave? You stop the screen share. What do you do to suss out if this is a, yes, we would like to move forward or not? Yeah. For sure. So, generally, in the beginning of the call, during the agenda, one of the things that I do is set them up for this one of two ways scenario. So at the end of this call, typically, you're gonna feel like, hey. We love Pave. We wanna continue this conversation, or this isn't for us right now. Please be transparent with me. My feelings won't be hurt either way. So they're getting ready for this question to come. I turn off the demo, and then I'm gonna say basically, like, look. I know that you mentioned x was important. We kind of covered that. Why was it important to you, Susie? I'm curious, like, after you've had a chance to now see it in action, what are your thoughts? So assuming that they say, you know, we feel pretty good about it. You know, we definitely need to probably circle back as a team and let you know how we're feeling. Like, how do you navigate the rest of the conversation from there? Where they give you, like, a we feel good, but I I rarely have a customer who says, yep. Send me the contract today. So what I'll do is if I'm getting kind of a a mild yes, I'm gonna try to test that yes by seeing, are you willing to tell me more about how you're gonna buy? So and then what I'll generally do too is I'll use timeline for that. Right? So my next question is when do you wanna buy? So okay. Great. I definitely wanna give you guys some time to think. I know that you mentioned you have a merit cycle coming up. When does that happen? Okay. It happens in twelve weeks. Our implementation typically takes about eight to twelve weeks. I certainly don't wanna put the pressure on you. But if this is something that you do wanna explore as a solution for this upcoming cycle, we would probably at least wanna get started on legal and security. Right? And so seeing how they react to that question is really gonna be indicative of whether or not they're real. Right? And if so, if they're like, yep. We definitely wanna talk internally, but let's talk more about that legal insecurity. I know that it's not a a lukewarm yes. They're posturing more than likely and that they're pretty into it. Right. And when you say legal insecurity, you're referring to the red line process. Right? Their attorneys reviewing your contract and then security making sure that you have all the compliance and stuff and so their data is not gonna get strewn onto the Internet. Can you talk me through how you will articulate what those processes look like? Because I imagine you're doing some intentional stuff. You're not just saying, yep. We gotta do legal and security. So the first thing I'm gonna do is once again reiterate the timeline that's necessary. Right? And so that's about twelve weeks out. Candidly, we can probably get it done more quickly, but I wanna focus on what's important to them. So one thing I'll often ask is, like, hey. Like, you know, how important is training to you? Right? Like, I'll often say the difference between an eight week implementation and a twelve week implementation is how prepared you are. And so I'll know where they have some gaps. So, like, I know you mentioned your bands aren't fully built out yet. I know you mentioned that your call philosophy is kind of in flux. With that being said, I would want you to have the full twelve weeks. And so getting them to align on the timeline and why why it's in their best interest to align with that timeline and get started sooner. And then the next piece is understanding, like, alright. If we wanna get this done, this is the day we need to sign by. So between now and signature, we have three weeks. From my understanding, there's generally some sort of legal review that takes place, and then some companies have a procurement process. Tell me more about how that works for you. Right? And I try to get them to tell me how long legal takes. And sometimes people will say, alright. You know, legal's pretty quick. Always be wary of that. And then some people say, just send us your stuff, and we'll go from there. Right? And some people have documents they need us to fill out. So just figuring out and navigating, first of all, how good they are at this process, how familiar they are with it so I know how much guiding I need to do, and then also understanding what are the steps and timelines internally and aligning them to make sure we can get them all done in that three weeks for that signature date. First of all, I love what you're doing around you're saying, look. We can do an eight week implementation, but the difference between an eight and a twelve week implementation is how ready you're gonna be when it's go live. And And what you're doing is you're making it seem like, yes, we can get there just so you don't, like, totally wash yourself out of a deal in case they have to do it in eight weeks. You're getting acceleration on their side so that they know that when they go live, they're gonna have a good experience as opposed to a discount or something that incentivizes you. You mentioned something that I wanna go back to, which is you'll ask about legal and security, which needs to happen before signature, obviously. And sometimes, there's a red flag where someone will say, oh, it'll be quick. When someone says, oh, yeah. It shouldn't be too bad. Legal and security, not too shabby. What do you do to unpack that to figure out if it's actually not gonna be bad or not? Yeah. But, like, awesome. Really great to hear that. Like, how long did it take the last time you bought some software? Right? And that will kinda put them back on their heels. If they actually buy software all the time, then they'll say, oh, we bought x and y and took this amount of time. Where if they're like, oh, well, actually, I'm not really sure exactly how long it took. Then I'll just take the ring and said, look. If we really wanna make that timeline, and this is where we set up the red line deadline. I say, I'm gonna get these documents over to you. My legal team works really fast. They can normally turn things around the same day. I imagine there's probably gonna be at least two or three back and forth here. And if it's gonna be more than that, we're gonna wanna get on a call. Right? And so let's imagine that you take four days from now, we turn around the next day, another four days, but walk it backwards, explain the timeline, and explain why. Alright. I'm gonna give you these documents. Can we agree that you're gonna have them back by this date because of all the stuff we just outlined? So I will tell them about the potential pitfalls and let them know, hey. That may not be the case with you, but it's all really gonna be possible. Right? And so what you're doing in this case is you're not just putting timelines to a signature date. You're not even putting a timeline to legal. You're putting a timeline to first cuts back from legal, especially if you feel like someone doesn't know how to manage a legal process. Because these enterprise legal processes, sometimes they'll take a month. They'll take multiple months. And if you just say, great. We need to have legal done by the end of the month, what will happen is you will get the first cuts back of your red lines on the twenty ninth day, and that's where your deal starts to slip. Justin, the last thing that I wanna hit on here is let's say that we now have this timeline in place. You talked about then teaching them how to buy. And I'm curious, how do you go about justifying the ask to do this demonstration with power now knowing that this is a champion who might wanna carry the torch all the way to the finish line internally on their own? Yeah. Really good question. So as I'm sure many listeners can attest to, a lot of the decision making as of late has been consolidated to finance because they need to approve almost everything. Right? So when I first started selling at Pave, we never talked to CFOs, and now no deal happens without talking to them. And so I'm very cognizant of the fact that this needs to happen. And so what I wanna do is make it about our best interest. Once they have already given me the yes, I know that they want Pave, I'm gonna say, like, look. In these trying economic times, I've seen it happen many times where everyone loves it. And at the end of the day, the CFO, they're probably not gonna care about this. Right? Because in their mind, all you're doing is trying to get yourself out of spreadsheets. But you and I, we know that there's so many deeper problems that a finance person may not understand. Right? And so help me, like, understand, like, how involved are they in this process? Or help me understand, like, is that the case with you? And then they'll let me know that, yes, they are gonna have to sign off. And I say, look. I totally understand. Like, CFOs are super busy. You may not wanna loop them in. But what I've seen is that, like, when they actually understand what this product does, it's gonna help tremendously with their perception of it. Right? And so try to help them understand the why behind it, and also let them know that, like, I get it. I've seen this, and I wanna make sure that you're gonna get what you want. Right? And I'm very, like, totally up to you kind of a vibe. Right? And let they'll generally be like, yeah. That makes a lot of sense because it does. It's absolutely killer that you're getting on the same side of the table, and you're making it I don't wanna call it an us versus them thing, but you're almost pulling your prospect aside. And you're like, hey. Between you and me, like, I know this is a big problem, but I know the battle you're gonna have to face, not with me on the pricing or whatever, but you're gonna have to face a battle internally to justify this to finance. And the best way to fight that battle is for them to see exactly what you saw, not the secondhand version of that. And so, Justin, let's say that you were going into that meeting with finance. I'm curious. What does your prep process look like with your champion if they've agreed to that meeting with finance? Yep. So we call this the old champion sandwich. Right? So once we've got that demo with the finance person, I'm gonna schedule some time with my champion prior to that, and I'm gonna ask them to go and, like, fill this out internally, have some conversations, and then you and I are gonna connect prior to the big demo and help me understand what are the major bullet points that they care about. And I always make it about, like, I wanna make sure you look good. I know you're putting, you know, your your, skin on the line here. So let's meet up after you chat with them. Help me understand what they care about. And then we're gonna talk about the bullet points that that finance person cares about. I'm gonna push them sometimes too because sometimes you'll have people that will just tell you to show the exact same stuff you showed me. And then I might say something like, hey. Look. I know why you care about doing a bonus calculation. Like, why does such and such care about that? Right? And once we get to, like, the real, like, top two or three points, I'm gonna review. Alright. Here's what you saw last time. Here's what I'm gonna show. I'm gonna highlight these things. How does that sound? And then even better, I'm gonna have my champion do the intro to the demo for me when we get on with the CFO, and then engage my champion and let them know, hey. I want you to answer this. You know, if this person asked this, like, you know why. Can you jump in here? So coaching them to be active and involved and help to make the case for me. So in the beginning of that big demo with the CFO, you're having your champion sort of do the intro and kick off why they're bringing this thing in and having the CFO look at it. Are you doing anything during that CFO demo to keep your champion being vocal, AKA get others in the room to sell for you? Yeah. So similar to, like, how I did in the previous demo where I've got those bullet points and the names next to them, if those people are in the room and those panes also align with the panes of the CFO, then I'm gonna do that same tactic where I'm gonna tell a story, call on that person, and be like, didn't you mention that this happened to you? And then get them to reiterate that story too and make sure that the CFO knows I'm not just blowing smoke, but this is really happening in your org. How do you end the meeting with the CFO? Do you ask them, do you wanna buy Pave? Normally, at this point, we've already know that, like, everyone else wants to buy Pave. So pretty much about dollars and cents at that point. Right? So I will generally ask a similar question. Everyone in the room is gonna be like, yes. We want it. CFO generally say, how much does it cost? And now we're transitioning to the next piece of the conversation, which is the negotiation. I'm curious. How do you, if at all, get inside baseball from your champion on how that negotiation will typically go with finance? Normally, for this point in the conversation, we already know whether they have budget allocated or not or what the budget situation is. So something that I might ask in the prep is, like, what's your CFO like? What's their vibe like? You know what I mean? Are they someone who's gonna try and cut me low? And if you built good rapport with your champion, it really does become kind of like an us versus them thing. I've had champions, like, tell me terrible things. Spot their CFO and tell me exactly what number they're gonna come in at and exactly what number they've really got. And so if you've done a good job building rapport and the champion genuinely wants the product, then they'll they'll tell you that kind of stuff. So getting whatever insights I can into their personality like, right now, I'm with the CFO who's literally told me, if you try to push me to a timeline, I'm going to drag my feet. Right? So the way I talk to him is totally different than I will talk to somebody who's like, you know, just tell me the price and sign. Right? And there's two totally different ends of the spectrum. How did you respond to that CFO said if you try to hold me to the timeline, I'm gonna get angry at you? I would say you the timeline isn't mine, actually. This is a timeline that has to do with your launch date. Right? And so if that launch date isn't as important as I have perceived previously, please let me know. I'm happy we can push this up further. You know what I mean? So making sure we rely on, like, why did we agree on this timeline in the first place? This isn't me trying to get a check. It's not commission breadth. It's your deadline. We can move it if you want. I mean, it's brilliant what you're doing. This is part of the reason why anytime you give the customer a deadline for action you're asking them to take, it must be tied to something that is in their favor. And most sellers will do some weird thing with price, and I guess that's technically in the buyer's favor. They get a better deal if they sign by XSieg. But it is so much more compelling when you say, hey. The reason you're doing this is because of this big thing that's coming up. And if you don't take action by this date, like, yeah, I'm gonna be bummed, but your team is going to deal with all of this headache and frustration and maybe even tears. And so, like, you're aligned with what's in their best interest, not some arbitrary date on the calendar. Exactly. Yeah. And throughout the whole process, you're constantly trying to build that ammunition. So by the time you get to that final boss and you're having that conversation, you should have so much in the coffers that you can bring up as to why you need to have this timeline or this price. Well, it helps keep momentum. And one other thing I wanted to ask you about, Justin, or sort of around momentum was, like, one of the big areas that I see salespeople lose momentum and then dragging their deals out is they don't get next steps on the calendar. Right? They finish a meeting with the customer and they say, yeah. This seems pretty cool. Like, I'm I'm gonna go chat with the team and, like, I'll I'll send you an email. Don't worry about it. What do you do in a scenario like that to make sure that you don't drop the ball on keeping the momentum in the deal? Yeah. For sure. So it depends. Like, if they come at me and they're, like, really hard about not wanting to book it, I'm gonna push it. If they're kinda, like, saying, oh, I'm not sure, then I'll say, you know what? Like, how does this time work? And we can put it down, and then you can reschedule it if you need be. Right? I'm just gonna toss a placeholder down, and then you can reschedule it using Chili Piper for a time that works for you. The moment that they've invited the other people and everyone's accepted, I make sure I delete placeholder from the title. Now it's an official meeting. Right? So that's one really good way to do it. Sometimes if you know, this one is it's a little more controversial, frankly, so I don't know if everyone should heed this advice, but it's worked for me in the past. You know, with the follow-up email, I'm gonna go ahead and cc the person that's their boss. And then when I set up that follow-up call, I'm gonna go ahead and invite them as optional. Right? And so sometimes they show up, sometimes they don't. Sometimes I get an earful, but more often than not, it works in my favor. So Well, Justin, we're running out of time here. The clock is a ticking, and I gotta keep momentum on the episode and move us to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing, and now I'm gonna ask you about what shouldn't. And so the last question is, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? I would say this is the one I chose because it's my worst habit and one that I'm finally getting better at seven years into my career. But I'd say the big mistake a lot of salespeople make is they are way too nice. And sometimes it feels like you're doing your best to help the prospect, but sometimes when you are at pushover, it turns you from a consultant into an order taker, and you lose respect. Right? And so challenge your prospect when your gut tells you, you know the market trends. You speak with practitioners and experts every day. They go to conferences and pay to have an experience that you have on a weekly basis. You are talking to their competition. You are an expert in your own right. Don't be afraid to speak up where you feel like it's necessary, and don't be afraid to challenge where you feel like it's necessary. Spectacular. Justin, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Justin Solis include, number one, should start your demos by setting the scene. In other words, orient me as to who am I in this demo and what am I doing in my day. Number two, if you get a mild yes at the end of the demo that says, yeah, It could be interesting. I wanna debrief internally. You can use timeline and sales process steps to test them and see if they're actually willing to do work to take a step forward. Number three. When you make the ask for power, make it an us versus them thing. In other words, what you should do is you should say, look. I've seen too many deals in this economy get killed because they think you're trying to solve a you problem, but you and I know there's a bigger problem, and the best way to prove that is by putting this in front of them directly. And then lastly, number four, align the time And then lastly, number four, align the timeline to close with their best interest, not your best interest. In other words, get them excited about the fact that more time to implement is going to mean a much better customer experience for them. Alright, Nick. How could people help us out? Well, you don't have to help us out this week. Help yourselves out this week. One of the things Justin talked about in the beginning of the episode was the idea of a story bank where you are mapping stories to the different features and elements of the thing that you solve. And I don't know about you, I have a certain amount of stories in my head, but I know for a fact that if I collaborated with my teammates, we would have more stories that we could all pull on and sell more effectively. And so if you listen to this episode, you might consider sharing it with some of your sales colleagues and saying, hey, maybe we should build a team story bank. That's all I got for you all. See you next week on thirty minutes to President's Club.
