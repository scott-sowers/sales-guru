## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Segalski. And today, we have the founder, mister Ross Rich, founder over at Accord. Nick, why should people listen? If you think about getting a deal done, you usually have a lot of action items you have to do, your buyer has to do. There's a bunch of different stakeholders. You're sharing all sorts of answers to questions and links to case studies and other collateral, and it can be really hard to get alignment and organization between you and your buyer. And Ross is an expert when it comes to what we call mutual action plans. So if you wanna become a map expert, no, not a cartographer, but a mutual action plan expert, you may enjoy this show. Step number one, listen to this episode. Step number two, connect with Ross on LinkedIn. Step number three, download the mutual action plan template in the show notes. And step number four, enjoy the show again. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Ross. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Awesome. The first is build an exec summary on behalf of your buyer. Even if it's just a crisp reframing of their key challenges and lightweight ROI, they're gonna have to do this anyway. If this is a real decision, a real deal, they're gonna have to do this for their key decision makers and other folks building consensus. So do that for them early. What does that look like? Even if it's two or three bullets, a better reframing because you're gonna be the expert in the thing that they're solving for of the challenges that you heard on that first or second call. Boom. One, two, three, for example, of Accord. Hey. Sounds like you're looking to increase deal velocity and win rates by x percent next quarter, especially in mid market and upper mid markets. And, hey, this is what it would look like. Typical eval might be two to three weeks. You know? These are the teams in a bit of a scope. That's gonna be a 100 times better than probably what your champion who's never evaluated or bought your thing before is gonna help you get in with the right folks and drive that deal forward. So build an executive summary on behalf of your buyer. Beautiful. What's number two, Ross? Number two, honestly, might be my personal favorite, the no ask exec touch also early on in the deal. It's the easiest way to start that executive level multithread and build a great relationship between your sponsor and theirs even before you need it. So what that might look like, we have our daily stand up on our sales team. A couple reps say, hey. I've had these great calls. Cool. Send me the note with some context so I can add it in. I can say, hey, Sarah. Just chatted with Nick. Sounds like you guys have had a great couple conversations with whatever stakeholder below them on their team about improving win rates and deal velocity and providing a better customer experience. Happy to help share how other customers that I've worked with maybe name drop two or three that are similar to theirs. If not, all good. I'll keep you update on things. Have a great one. When it comes to them, later on in the deal, you're gonna jump on that Zoom, and you're gonna feel like friends, and it's gonna feel really great because you're gonna be keeping them up to date with no expectations. And if they reply, you know you really have something on your hands. And if they don't, helpful signal to how real the deal might be. So that's the no ask exec touch early on in the deal. I love it. Round us out, Ross. What's number three? Well, you know, I gotta bring in mutual plans. But maybe let's get really specific here. Your mutual plan should have something post sales in it that is important to the customer. So extending that, this is not a closed plan. This is a mutual action plan, mutual success plan that is about the challenges that they're solving in that executive summary like we talked about. Most folks that I see are really obsessing over everything to get done to signature versus what the customer really cares about, which is implementing and solving those core business challenges. For example, what they might be missing that I highly recommend including, the teams on both sides that are gonna get looped in post signature. Setting those expectations about what are the stakeholders on their side and your side that you might wanna get introduced even beforehand to feel really secure about this working out post signature, how long it takes to get to success. A lot of people, I think, kinda skip around this. Oh, you know, it's a couple weeks, whatever. No. This is exactly how long it takes most of our customers to get here and set expectations around their investment post sales. Again, don't hide behind these things. They wanna know. They know probably if they're qualified buyer, what it's gonna take. You probably should know if they're willing to do that. Because if not, you sign them, they don't go live, no good for both sides. So that's the mutual plan extending past the close. Love it. So for everyone in the audience who hasn't heard us talk about mutual action plans or joint execution plans, AKA MAPS or JEPs, essentially, what a mutual action plan is, is it's a series of steps from beginning of sales cycle through close and all the way through close going into implementation that walk your customer through. Here are the steps we need to take to have a successful customer journey together. And you own some of those steps, and I own some of those steps. Cool. So just to level set with the audience, that's what a MAP or a JEP is. So Ross, oftentimes when people think MAP or JEP, they're just like, great. Once we get into vendor review, I'm gonna have a MAP or a JEP to go through legal and security. But oftentimes one of the most underrated places to use a map or a JEP is early in the sales cycle. And so I'm curious, what are the types of activities or events in a sales cycle that I should be putting in my map or JEP early on in a deal cycle to make sure that it goes well before we even get close to vendor review? The things that I would focus on would be key milestones that the customer cares about. It is not every meeting. This is where I see it fall short. It's every meeting. It's every decision. It's every piece of collateral. It's the overwhelmingness for the customer. I know we might be thinking about our sale. Constantly, we might be there for one, two, three, four years at a company selling the thing, and it feels like the back of your hand. It does not feel like that for the customer. This is probably their first, maybe second, or third time buying this type of thing or even buying something in general, overwhelming them with a number of steps versus just the two to three per stage, maybe of three or four stages to a deal, two or three key things that you can focus on. This is what we're doing next, and this is what we've accomplished so far. That would be my recommendation of what to include. For example, leadership approval. It's not meeting with the different folks in leadership. It's not creating the executive summary. It's not creating the ROI. It is formally getting thumbs up from a key leader stakeholder. That's the thing that's included in your JEP or your map, not the 100 other things behind the scenes. That's the work that you're doing. Ross, when you're introducing a mutual action plan to the customer, I could potentially see a customer saying, woah. I've never done or touched one of these before. We just sort of started talking and, like, having resistance being like, wait. Is is this a thing I gotta do? What the heck is this? And then being afraid of it. So I'm curious. When you're introducing the mutual action plan, how are you positioning and explaining what it is and why it's to the customer's benefit to engage in this process? Improperly. The framing is so key, and it has to be about the customer, not about you closing the deal. So for example, this is what I've heard and picked up from our customers actually is the best way of doing it. I don't even think I was doing it this well before was, hey. Our team, as we think about building partnerships, we use these to help customers understand what the process looks like to successfully evaluate, validate, and onboard to Accord. This is what we've already done so far. Hey. You can see the work that we've done, and this this is an example of what would be included later. And this is what I'd recommend us doing next. But I know that every organization works differently, has unique people in different organizations and structured. I'd love to share with you what we normally do and get your feedback to make sure that I'm not setting you down the wrong course. And then from there, it is your joint plan, and that is the key thing that is missing. It's the asking them for the input. It's not, hey. This is the thing. This is what we do. Okay. This is next. And so, Ross, at what point in the sales cycle are you typically surfacing this with your customer? Is that at the end of your first disco call? Is that once you've done a demo? Like, I struggle sometimes when I should be pulling this thing together. Yep. I would say if it's inbound, after that second call. So first one is probably that thirty, forty five minute, who are you? Who are we? Is there even a thing worth talking about here? Maybe you're setting up for, okay. We're gonna dive more into specifics about how we solve these problems you mentioned. We're gonna, you know, do more disco about what you're trying to solve for, maybe bring in one or two other key stakeholders and say at the end, hey. From the first couple conversations, this is what I've heard. You're trying to do this. You're trying to do that. This is what we do. If you were interested in taking a next step, this is what the overall process looks like. So I'm not just telling you this is the next thing, then this is the next thing. You're getting that overview, the high level. And the feedback from the Gong recordings and Chorus recordings I've heard with reps do this really well is, like, literally stop the meeting. The customer is saying, wow. It is so helpful to understand what the process looks like. Yes. I wanna know your features and functionality. Yes. I wanna know the pricing. What's it gonna take for me for the next few weeks as I plan out my life on top of I have a job on top of potentially buying this thing. What is that gonna take for me? Who needs to be involved is just super helpful and appreciative and doesn't feel like you're forcing them down this next step and selling them on the next step. It feels like they're opting in or not to the evaluation cycle. When you explain that, hey. There's a lot of complexity. Here's the problem. And then you propose a solution. Here's how other folks have solved it before using a map. And then you explain the benefits of it. There's There's gonna be a lot of complexity and information shared. You get the customer to say, yeah. Let's please do that. Armando, I actually wanna ask you too because I know you've introduced these a lot at the end of the sales cycle. Are there ways that you're voicing this over or introducing it to the customer? Yeah. So Ross, to your point, my trigger point is quite early in the deal cycle. And one of the things that you talked about is before you bring in a map, you need to understand, okay, is there even a problem that I can solve? And do I even have the right person to share the map with? Right? So I can't just share it with whoever jumps on the call. I might have the wrong champion. So I have two trigger points for when I start a map. Number one is I have clearly identified who I think my champion is going to be. And then number two is I might not have the full problem fleshed out, right? I might not have all the technical validation done, but I have a lot of it done such that I know the champion cares about this thing. And for that reason, the map is less focused on finding problems and more so my voiceover is, Hey, it sounds like there's a they're here. And like, it sounds like there are a lot of people we're going to have to get in front of. We're going to have to do legal security. And look, you have a full time job too. Can we get on the same side of the table here? And maybe I can try to make your life really easy by mapping out how other folks would typically buy something like a cord, pave 30 MPC, what have you. And they're always going to say, absolutely, that would be super helpful because they want to be taught how other leaders just like them are buying. And so from there, Ross, I'm curious from your standpoint, you're including things like leadership sign off. You're probably including things like finance sign off too. And my guess is you're not just templatizing every single map. I've seen some sellers do some really creative things where they will precede the map or the JEP with the specific names of the people who they see on LinkedIn that they think they need to sign off on. Are there certain things you're doing to customize your map or JEP to the customer? I'm curious how that looks. Totally. And the way I think about anything that involves this level of customization is starting with the template. Because when you wanna customize, have the fill in the blank. So I always start with a template that has three key components to it. First, the milestones, and then I'm gonna edit the names of the milestone. For example, we'll pick three different milestones. So for example, maybe it's the business validation, so that core ROI and difference between what they're doing today or looking at. Maybe it's the technical validation. Hey. How long is this gonna take? What's the investment to do? Maybe it's a build versus buy decision. And then third, maybe it's that executive level approval. I would then think about so that's one piece of the milestones. I'd think about the stakeholders like you said. Okay. Then based on that, who needs to be looped in and customizing that step as well as third, the why behind it and tying those all together and being like, okay. Nick to get Arman's approval on this thing for initiative around improving win rates. Like, when you see those but it ties in a lot of pieces to that discovery that you're doing. So that's how I think about it. Starting with, I have my technical validation, business validation, leadership approval, then I'm taking all the components of the why and the stakeholders and tying it into that step. So it feels super custom to them. It's really intelligent what you're doing here, actually. You're building out milestones. Like, okay. We gotta build a business case. There's people that need to be involved in that. Okay. We've gotta get technical approval. There's people that need to be involved in that. So all you're doing is you're attaching the milestone to the human beings that need to give the thumbs up to that piece of it. What is your approach to ensuring that this is indeed a mutual plan where you're, like, soliciting because you just listed those three milestones. How do you get the person to say, wait. Wait. Wait. There's a fourth. I think it has to start again. That's why it's so important to begin the relationship with these kind of things because it's really hard to get that later. Hey. The framing of how you're working together, and this is a visualization. This is like a concrete thing. If they're not adding it from the start, good luck at trying to get them to add it later when you're working on a million other things. Right? So that's how I think about it is getting them to commit to and adding one thing at the start, they're gonna add it later. It's really hard to go backwards. Right? And that's why I think about front loading this stuff is so important. Getting that executive summary out from the beginning, getting the stakeholder mapping and expectations about who needs to be involved in both sides, getting the mutual plan and the key milestones. Is really hard to get them to contribute later if it doesn't truly start mutually. So going back to Nick's earlier point around making this not overwhelming is if we're building a map all the way through implementation and you're doing this map early in the sales cycle, I imagine, like, it's a little bit terrifying if you're like, Oh, by the way, Golar's all the way over there, and there are a million more steps that we have to go. And so I almost imagine, you know, those, like, dog kibble feeders that like once you eat the kibble, it feeds you a little bit more kibble. Are you doing like the next three steps in the map, but not the next 20 and then like adding as they sort of check things off or do you just shotgun it all at them all at once? So this has been probably my biggest learning from really focusing on maps the last three years at Accord has been the staging of it, has been how was it helpful enough at that point in time? How was it enough detail there? And when you really dig into it, you're getting to that next level to actually do that proper day long technical validation, answer all those questions, get the right people. Yes. It's about at the start, how can you just simplify it? You're talking about the stages, not even the steps. I'm talking about, first, we do this evaluation on both sides, then we're doing this valuation for the business and technical, then we're getting leadership approval, then and you're just talking about the not even the steps. Then you're getting into really narrowing in on this when you're in a stage just on that one thing. So you're not talking about if you're doing the business validation, you might not be talking about the depths of the security reviews and legal and compliance and the implementation. You're talking about that as a stage and when it's gonna come next and maybe one piece of that that you need to start setting up for. And then, yes, adding in more details as you go. So that's how I've thought about it is, what's the story at the beginning? Then what's the thing we're really focused on now? And then adding to that as you go and dig into those steps and stages. But it's a tough thing, I think, for people to really nail that framing as a rep and take some practice. Christopher T. Anderson (zero fifty three:fifty three): So this is one thing that is critical for everything to note is when I first started using Maps, I would have this template with 25 steps, five sections, five steps per section, and I would just copy it. And I would be like, awesome. Let's get started. And because it was this insurmountable amount of food to digest for the customer, they wouldn't end up using it. Right? But they need to know where the thing is going. And so what I learned is have the steps mapped out for the current stage you're in. You might be an exec buy off stage, and the three micro steps might be sign off from chief people officer, sign off from CFO business case, for example. Right? But then have the big stages or categories listed below so they at least know what the next big rocks are. So it might say things like legal and security. It might say financial review. It might say procurement, what have you. But it doesn't have 10 steps under each of those categories. So you can still anchor to a go live date. You can still say, Hey, we know we're going to have to do that stuff later. But they're not getting overwhelmed by those steps earlier in the process. Do I have that right? Yeah. And then the one thing that also was a key learning recently was going back to and I never used to do this. Going back to the things that you completed. The same reason why you're focusing on those three, we've done these things. It helps add momentum and that social proof of validation of, like, we're doing this stuff. Like, this is happening and it's going well. So when you get later, oh, you have all this momentum. If you're not referring back to the things that you've done with them and you'll have that visual social proof when you're getting looped into a new stakeholder, you can be like, hey, Jessica. I've been working with Nick and Armand last three month. Okay. Cool. Was he just saying? No. Here are the things that we have done that speak to your internal challenges and all the right people and meetings that we've had. Oh, wow. We're, like, in this. We're invested as a potential partner here. Jessica on that call is gonna be so much more invested in presence if they know that that's how much time and energy their peers and company have put into it so far. Ross, I wanna take a sort of step away from maps for this next question, and it involves sort of multithreading and getting other stakeholders involved in the deal. And an area that I've struggled before is, like, I've got a champion. I've got some people, like, on the exec side involved, and we're doing technical approval. And I might meet with, like, a CIO or a CTO or a head of IT, and we're doing some technical approval. And we show up to the call, and they have zero idea what we do. And it's a wholly unproductive meeting because, like, my champion hasn't prepped them, they haven't done any prep, and we don't get anywhere in that meeting. And so aside from me just, like, sending them the link to, like, here's the map with all the steps we've completed, How can I make sure that, like, when I bring a new stakeholder into the meeting, and it doesn't have to be the IT example, that that person is up to speed and prepared for the meeting? Yeah. There's two things that make our reps and that I do anytime I set up a new meeting with key stakeholders. So that's a win. Okay. New group of people. This is a new opportunity to set a first impression and build another champion in other side of the business. It's meeting set, calendar invite goes out. This is what we're looking to accomplish. This is the context. Hey. Met with Nick. He suggested me with you to do this thing. This is why this is the why we're doing and this is where it fits into the process. The day before or two days before the meeting, hey. I'm sure you had a lot going on. I know this is probably not the the number one thing you've been thinking about this week on the Thursday morning. Just wanted to send a friendly reminder. Yes. Hey. If you were curious to check out our site or this thing, click here for thirty seconds. You go into that meeting. Most of the time, you're gonna get the day before, the two days before that thank you. Hey. Thanks so much. Yeah. A lot going on. We're really looking forward to digging into this. If you're not creating those opportunities to get that context, yep. Nine times out of 10, you're gonna go in the meeting. They might say, yeah. I know what's going on, and they're on Slack doing whatever. You're sort of making me rethink, like, I've gotta do some of that heavy lifting. And I would rather, like, lean into being a little bit of a pest with, like, pre meeting emails than the inverse of that where I'm not aggressive enough and they don't show up prepared. This is so important because what you're doing is you are front loading the effort, which is a theme that is emerging here. What a lot of salespeople do is they don't do any, like, thing in advance of the meeting. They go have a meeting, and it might be an okay meeting, And then they put all of their effort into the recap email and following up with the buyer and, like, working the multithread, which don't get me wrong. That stuff's important. But if you actually can reallocate some of that effort to what you do pre meeting, you end up having things go so much better. So oftentimes, what'll happen is, let's say you do all that pre meetings work. You think your champion has prepped your economic buyer. You've sent an email, maybe you've sent a video too, and still they don't view it. The beautiful part about this is folks, what I find the best sellers do is they understand that what you are selling is an hour meeting in a forty hour work week. It is a one hour meeting in a forty hour work week, which means you take up approximately 2% of their brain space during any given week. Okay? My math isn't great, but it's close. Okay? And so using your map, if you've done a good job, number one, every single time you meet with your champion before that big meeting, after that meeting, you're walking through what I call last three, next three, which is here are the last three things that we've done. Here are the next three things we need to do. And then when you jump onto that big team demo, when you're meeting with power, you need to assume that even though you've done that work, they are not going to remember where the heck this thing is. They're gonna jump onto this meeting for the first time and be like, what the heck have you been doing meeting with these people 17 times? This thing seems like the train has already left the station. And so my favorite way to start those big team meetings is sort of cheesy, but I usually say in the last episode of Dragon Ball Z and recap the last three or four major things that happened in the map and then talk about what we're doing today and how that ties to the next two things that come up in the map. And so it's truly like your litmus test and it's your compass for where you stand in the deal cycle. And so bringing this full circle, Ross, as we go through this thing together, I'm curious, how are you holding your champion accountable to each of these tasks? Are you doing a recurring meeting? Are you emailing this to them every week? Like, how are you actually project managing this entire thing versus just leaving the doc there to have it sit in an inbox somewhere? Totally. Yeah. If it's a upper mid market enterprise deal, 100 ks plus deal, definitely that recurring meeting with the champion, it's worth it for them. It's a big decision. If it's not, if it's more of that high velocity, maybe that $10.20, 30 ks deal, That's sometimes a lot. And it's usually, you want this to be sold sub thirty days, sub three weeks, probably. So probably not at that level. I think where I try to get to is a texting basis or that, like, post call basis. Hit them up casual, like, no subject line. Hey. Can we jump on? Here's my number. That kind of more lightweight. So that's how I think about those touchpoints. Okay. Yeah. You have that big meeting. Hey, the day or two before. Hey, to make sure that I do a good job of using everyone's time, it's their social capital that they use to get that call in the books. I'll kind of refer back to that. Hey. To make sure we use Nick and Armand's whatever best time appropriately in forty five minutes tomorrow around this. Can we sing for ten? I wanna get your feedback on the thing I've already done. Talking about doing the work. I've done this thing. I'm prepping for it. I'm thinking about it a ton. Can I use ten minutes of your time to get feedback on it to put in the words that they use internally? So when we start that meeting, everyone, that's a great suggestion. Hey. Not just talk about the steps. Again, looping in that why to it, that exact summary. Hey. We've talked about these things because you're working on this. And this is what we're gonna talk about today that has to do with the thing you're working on. And this is what we're doing next to solve for that. That is really important. It can only come from those either casual touch points on a high velocity deal or those structured meetings for the more enterprise focused cycles. So to recap sort of what you're doing here, Ross, one, when you're sending that note to the buyer before that big meeting, you're saying, hey. I'm doing some prep just to make sure that I use Nick and Arman's time, like, as effectively as possible. You're doing a couple things here. One, you are signaling that you are doing work on their behalf. And I've been talking about this a lot recently. People reciprocate effort. They respond in kind. And when you show that you're putting the work in, they feel compelled to reciprocate as they should. It's the right thing to do. The other thing you're doing is you are giving a reason attached to your ask. What you're not doing is saying, hey. I'm doing some prep for this meeting. I'd love to hop on a call with you to talk about what I should cover. What you're actually doing is saying, hey. To make sure we use that time as effectively as possible. Anytime you ask your buyer to do something, to take action, this applies to everything in sales, you must explain why it is in their best interest to do that. So you are saying to make sure that we use your boss's boss' time as effectively as possible, let's sync for ten minutes. It's really nuanced what you're doing, but for the audience, like, highlight and lean into that. Ross, we are running out of time, and I'm running out of breath. And so we gotta move ourselves to the final question. And the final question is this. We have talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I'm gonna ask you about the inverse, which is a shouldn't. And so the final question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it's hurting them more than it helps? Yep. I mean, this shouldn't be a surprise from the topics that we've covered, but I think what I see is people waiting until mid or late stage deals to really invest the time, the effort, and the relationship with their champions. They're not multi threaded until they feel like it's a real secure, like, for sure committed deal. They don't have that business case. They don't have anything quantified in terms of their ROI. They might not have a mutual action plan set up until they're like, oh, this is real. This is like a great company and qualified. Good luck then restarting, rebuilding any of those expectations relationship. What you put in is what they're gonna put in the rest of the cycle. You have set the expectation for how much work is gonna be done on both sides. After that second call, after that third call, they've looped in stakeholders. If you haven't been sending those prep notes, absolutely nailing those group demos, all of those things that are gonna happen super early in the deal, they're not gonna reciprocate. And your chances of winning those deals are gonna be a lot lower. So I would say, stop with the the 100 follow ups after all the stuff. Put your effort in the warmest early stage deals. Give it your all. The things that feel like they're moving fast, hold on to them. The things that might just not be there, spend the effort, you know, accordingly. Beautiful. Ross, thank you so much for joining us today. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Ross Rich include, number one, make sure you share the map with the right person. In other words, you should probably have your champion identified before you engage in a mutual action plan so you have the right person shopping you around the org. Number two, when you actually build that map, make sure you build out the key milestones in your deal and not just the milestones, but also the people who need to be involved in those milestones. Number three. However, do not show every single step in your mutual action plan all at once. It will be too overwhelming, and no one will use your mutual action plan. Instead, have the big stages and buckets and only flesh out all of the steps for the stage that you are in and maybe the next stage that you're about to enter. And then lastly, number four, extend the map not just past the closed, which is really what you want, but all the way through their go live date, which is what they want. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here? Well, folks, you might be sitting here saying, man, these maps sound awesome, but they're a lot of work to put together. I wish I had a template put together by some smart guys that I could just steal and use for my own purposes. Well, you're in luck because Arman and I sat down with the very kind folks at Accord, and we put together our mutual action plan template, and there is a link to that in the show notes for you to steal for free. So go take it, use it with your buyers, and we'll see you next week on thirty minutes to President's Club.
