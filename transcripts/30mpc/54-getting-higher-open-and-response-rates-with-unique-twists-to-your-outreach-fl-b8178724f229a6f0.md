## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes Presidents Club. My name is Armond Troop. I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigilski. And today, we have the man who's running SDR over at Lupio. His name is Florin D'Tullia. Nick, why should people listen? If you're looking for subject lines to steal and sequence structures to copy, you probably wanna listen. Three, two, 1. I'm calling you tomorrow. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, Florin. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Number one, ask illuminating questions in both cold calls and emails. If you're wondering what an illuminating question is, so essentially, you wanna start the conversation and ask a question to get people to think differently about their current situation. And I'll give you a perfect example of how we do that at Loopio. So one of the questions that we ask either as the first sentence in an email or on a cold call after we set up the upfront contract would be something like, hey, Nick. Enterprise days are usually spending multiple days responding to an RFP. How are you ensuring that your reps are focusing on managing their pipelines while responding to 300 questions RFPs at the same time? And, essentially, what that does, it gets it's a pattern disrupt, but it also gets them to think a little bit differently about, like, oh, okay. I I never really thought about it like that, and it opens up a much better conversation on a cold call or over a potential email. Cool. What's number two? So number two is we prefer using witty photos over a video in outreach, specifically on the outbound side of things. The way that we look at it, outbound is about efficiency and we found that videos take, first of all, a significant amount of time. And a lot of people don't actually open and view them. Really, what we wanna do is we have this one photo that works really well. It's essentially like the SDR holding up a sign. A very important piece of this is making sure that the prospect's name is on it so it looks more personal. And then we have just like a PS, I'm not a robot, and a little robot actually, like, drawn on the whiteboard. And I can't fully explain it, but, like, the amount of positive responses that we get from this is amazing. And we booked hundreds of meetings. And I'm actually estimating that because of that photo, we've sourced and closed about over $1,000,000 in in ARR. So, it's something one of our SDRs did and it's been truly fantastic. Wow. What's number three, Florin? Round us out. So number three, backloading your sequences with touch points. So when you think about a sequence, a lot of people actually front load their sequences. They think that their first three to six steps are are generally the most important. This is actually a tip that I got from Beck Holland, and I can validate right here on the show that she knows exactly what she's talking about. We ran the data. So what you wanna do is your last six steps are gonna be aggressively over six days. Three calls one day at a time, then three emails after that to round it off. And what we've actually did there, we've increased our reply rate from about a 0.4% per email to roughly 2.5%, which is essentially almost like a a five time increase, which is awesome. This one drives me crazy because in my sequences or if you're on sales, a lot of cadences, touches one, two, and then, like, 10 are always the best. And then three through nine, it's, like, 0% or, like, point 8%. And I'm, like, should I even be sending these emails? So could you tell me a little bit more about what are you doing in those middle emails right towards the end of your sequence that isn't just, like, blasting them? Hey. Are you interested? Are you interested? I think a lot of people overthink the copy in a lot of these emails. By that point in the sequence, you've already or should have at least provided a decent amount of of value and content that's actually relatable to them, and also had multiple steps that have a good pitch on what your company and product is actually doing. So at that point, it's almost just like reminding them that you're there and being a little bit aggressive so that you're getting to the yes or to the no very quickly. One of our emails, it has roughly 30% open rate, 2.5% reply rate. It's literally a sad face reply to the email before it, which is, usually a value email that has a few pieces of content with no ask. Our very last step is essentially just being like, hey. Throughout all of this, I actually forgot to ask. Are you even the right person to speak with? And a lot of people actually do that in one of their first steps, but it's much more powerful when you do that at the very end of your sequence once you've provided that value and people know what you do already. Florent, I'm curious about how you're incorporating content into the sequence. It sounds like you're attaching things, maybe case studies, maybe other marketing collateral. Can you talk about that a little bit? Yeah. So I've also we've done this mistake as well where we try to, like, overload an email and you have, like, three pieces of content, three links, three attachments, or whatever. And it's just too much, especially for for someone that's super busy like an executive. So what we do is we try to have a use case or a story that we're telling in a specific email. It'll be one piece of content, one thing we use at Loopio, for example. We have a industry benchmark report that comes out every year that everyone's super interested in. So one of the touches is like, hey. If you're curious how you're stacking up against your peers in the RFP space, wanted to provide you this insight report, three takeaways, and we don't ask for anything. It's just an email that is essentially I almost think of it like a retargeting ad. It's like, hey. We're here. Here's some value. You let them go, and then you you come back later and actually have an ask. So have you seen anything with when it comes to your open rates? Because I know you got the photo thing too, and I would consider that content as well. You you mentioned that you get over 50% open rates. Sometimes I've seen teams with open rates of, like, 30%. How do you get that number up? An open rate is essentially gonna be based off of two things that we're constantly AB testing. It's gonna be the subject line, and it's gonna be that first sentence in the email that's essentially like a preview. We try to elicit some kind of emotion in a lot of our subject lines, and I'll give you a perfect example. So at Lupia, we sell our few response offers, so we help sales teams respond to our fees and security questioners a lot faster. A subject line that's working really well right now that has a 50 to 60 open rate depending on when you send it is literally like RFP deadlines. Now if you're responding to RFPs as a salesperson, you're probably gonna open that just because it's like you get a little bit of a scare in some sense. One thing that we used to do is RFP deadlines for account name, and we actually got some negative feedback around that because people were like, hey. This is not, genuine and, like, you're kind of lying with that subject line. So we've changed it to kind of be on that the edge. We're walking a thin line between, like, evoking some emotion and making sure that we're not disingenuous. That's smart. If I got RFP deadlines in my in my inbox, I would totally open it. That's hilarious. What about that first sentence, that preview text? I I've never heard of somebody optimizing that. So the way that we actually structure our emails, we try to ask the illuminating question, like, upfront. So, for example, provide, like, a piece of like I said earlier with a Lupeo example Or another example that I actually did recently on a post was for Vidyard, which was like, the sales team at SalesLoft just ran a study across 15,000,000 emails that showed that enterprise prospects are 65% less likely to reply to outbound emails. As you continue to go on market in the enterprise space, how are you ensuring that your reps are equipped to cut through that noise? That first sentence is a piece of research. It's different than what the typical SEO is gonna send. Like, hey. I checked out your LinkedIn, and I think that's why it works in combination with the subject line. So can we talk about these illuminating questions? Because you gave an example in the beginning, and you've got one here. And I'm thinking, alright. I wanna formulate some on my own. Because I've never really done in prospecting where I'm asking questions of people. I'm usually talking about a problem I think they have and how I think I can help with that problem. But I've never really touched on let me ask a question to get them to take a meeting with me. Can you help me come up with the structure for an illuminating question? Like, what are the components I need to have? So the way that I look at it is it's important to have some kind of a statement or a piece of research that you're you're essentially showing them to be like, hey. Like, this is this is the current situation. So in the loop cases, like, enterprise e a's are usually spending multiple days responding to an RFP. You could also use a specific stat. Like, if I don't have any off the top of my head for loopio right now, but if we use, like, three days on average or whatever. So it's like a fact they know that you've done research on that specific topic. I did the research with SalesLoft. I know that 50,000,000 emails have showed that enterprise prospects are 65% less likely. And now it's like the way that I look at the the end of that question is, like, how are you insuring is kinda how I tend to open it up. How am I making sure that how are you making sure that your ideal state is actually happening? So almost nobody actually answers, the question. It's usually just like, hey. Like, yeah. This is this is a problem for us. Like, let's chat or, yeah. I'm interested. Book me in or whatever. It's almost a trap a little bit. Like, because how do you really answer that question? Like, there might be certain things that you're you're doing to break through that noise, but there's more that you could be doing. And that's when it's like, okay. We should have a conversation. So can we talk about some of the other components of the sequence here? You've got the illuminating question email. We've got the sad face email. We've got the, hey, I'm not a robot email. Are there any other touch points that really stand out from a context strategy perspective? This is a bit controversial with prospects specifically. We do get some people that are not very happy with it, but it's an email that gets a response. So subject line is calling tomorrow. Pretty much the email says, like, hey, Nick. I'm gonna give you a call tomorrow at 11:30AM. If you're like other folks, like, here's a piece of some kind of valuable content that I think you'll find valuable. Looking forward to discussing it then. Wow. Very simple. Now it does two things. So the way that I look at the sales development world is, like, it's about efficiency. I wanna get to a yes or I wanna get to a no. The worst thing that could possibly happen is that someone ignores me and is, like, essentially a maybe. So what that does is people literally respond with, okay. Looking forward to talking then. Or they say, no. Absolutely not. Don't contact me. And it elicits enough of an an emotion that people tend to respond, but then you're like, you know what? If you're not interested, I'm gonna move on from here. And that saves SDRs a ton of time. Dude, that's so good. At what point in the sequence is that? So that's actually on our step six. So Gotcha. For us, the way that and just to get a bit more into sequences. So the way that we do the front of our sequences is also based off of some stuff that Beck Holland talks about. But we do, like, multi step days. So day one is three touches. It's like a LinkedIn, email, and then a phone call. You take a break for a day. Then on day three, you do another, like, LinkedIn connection request if the first step was a view. Or if you've already connected with them, then you send them an actual, like, DM, email, phone call, and then you wait a few days. And then that that next email is gonna be the calling tomorrow. Can we talk about the negative responses? Because this is something that really stressed me out when I was in SDR, where I prospect and maybe I do something a little controversial like that, and you get this angry response. How do you respond to something like that, if at all? So one of the things I'm curious about is, like, you get these negative email responses. And this always really stressed me out as an SDR because, like, I have a finite territory list. I only have so many accounts and and contacts at those accounts that I can go after. And one, I'm stressed I'm gonna lose my job if I took a prospect off and, like, don't apologize. Two, I might have to go after that person to try book a meeting in two quarters. And so I'm curious about when somebody gets upset at one of your prospecting emails, how do you respond? Yeah. Yeah. It's a very good point, and and we do have to obviously deal with that probably about once a week. So this is how it's we do it, and it's literally worked every single time. So it's not escalating it to a manager or anything like that. The SDR responds, and they diffuse the situation by literally, like, be vulnerable, ask the prospect for feedback, and just, like, how how would they do it? So being like, hey. I really appreciate the feedback. Like, I'm sorry that this missed the mark. I'm actually just trying a bunch of, like, different tactics right now. As a sales leader yourself, I'm just curious, like, what do you think I could have done to to kind of improve this and then maybe even provide an alternate way of doing things? So for example, RFP so we had the subject line RFP deadlines for account name. Had a few prospects that really didn't like that, thought it was disingenuous. So then we would, like, apologize, ask for feedback, and be like, do you think it'd be better if we did this subject line instead? And almost every single time without fail, because we sell it to sales, that might help a little bit and they kinda get it. They would actually provide feedback and it would diffuse the situation and then you you would actually start the conversation back up. I love it. This is so good, man. Let's start to segue into the other side of things. You have your team doing the first discovery call, which is not traditional. You're an SDR leader. Most of the time, those get handed off to an AE. But in your case, you're not even doing a call call. You're doing a first discovery call with your SDRs. So you've asked those questions in your cold call. You've asked questions in your emails. You've gotten some responses. How do your SDRs then tee up that call without getting super deep in the weeds and stealing all the thunder of the a's? But what's your general approach to an SDR discovery call? Yeah. I like the discovery calls from a SDR perspective as a competitive advantage. Like, if you have really good SDRs and they can ask great questions and have a good disco, it sets up the sales cycle so well for the account executives. And we've gotten a ton of great feedback on our discovery calls recently because, our SVP of sales, Rick, actually just implemented a framework called commanded the message by force management, which, really resonates with me. It just differs so much than a lot of SEOs are doing, like, the banter. Like, banter is all about you trying to get information. It's it's never about the prospect. And and our whole philosophy is, like, that whole call needs to be about them and understanding what they're looking for so that we could set them up for a demo that's not gonna waste their time. So the framework is kinda like this, and this is how we break down the discovery call. So first is, like, obviously, the intro and making sure that you're setting an agenda and an upfront contract of if, hey, if this makes sense at the end, we're gonna we're gonna book the demo. Then comes the before state, which is what is your current situation right now? But more than that, what are the negative consequences on your business of how you're doing things today? And really trying to get to, like, essentially, like, revenue. Do you need to increase revenue? Do you need to decrease cost? Do you need to mitigate risk? Like, you wanna get to that level of negative consequence. The next step is the after state or what we call the ideal state. So where do you want to be? What does ideal look like for you? And then this is what a lot of people miss. What is the positive business outcome of this ideal state? What's gonna happen if we get you there? For you, for the business, etcetera. The next part is required capabilities, which is like, okay. We now know what your ideal state is. What do you need in the actual platform? And this is, like, this is where we can start getting into the weeds and it's dangerous because you don't wanna go into, like, features. You just wanna go into, like, high level concepts. So for us, for example, like, our required capability of an RFP response software is, like, you need a centralized library to store all of your information. Okay. Great. And we ask a few other things. This is also a great place, especially if it's on outbound, to influence the required capability. So you're influencing them to think about certain features that they maybe didn't even think about in the past and that are a competitive advantage for you. And then finally, it's metrics. And it's metrics is like, okay. What are you actually gonna do, or what do you actually need to see to purchase the solution? Like, what metric throughout the sales cycle would be would essentially make you buy the platform? For RFP software, for example, it might be like we wanna see the response time being cut down by 50%, or we wanna see our win rate on RFPs go up by 5%. And essentially, once you're doing that, you kinda summarize that then in what we call a mantra. But this pretty much lays it all at the foundation of like, you should know now what it's gonna take, and there shouldn't be many surprises throughout the sales cycle. Yeah. And so let's talk about that first piece. I'm familiar with command of the message. It's current state, negative consequences, after state, positive business outcomes, and then from there, you go on. And so what oftentimes I find is the easiest thing to do is ask questions about your current state. How are you doing today? What does this look like? What's this process like? Where it starts to go awry is, especially for SDRs, they don't know how to ask the questions about the negative consequences without it feeling like super leading questions or a little bit cringey. And so could you talk about how you have your SDRs approach that part of command and the message? Yeah. For sure. And this is why specifically, I I don't have, like, a script for the SDRs where they have to ask specific questions because I want them to be like, okay. Focus on them. The negative consequences, like, okay. Let's use Lupio again. So a lot of people right now, like, they'll have multiple libraries. They'll have, like, Google Docs, past RFPs. Their current state is a Google Doc where they have to, like, find answers, copy and paste, control f, and it's just a a disaster. So just being, like, what is the net like, how is it impacting, like, your day by the fact that you have to, like, waste time copying and pasting and finding answers when you could literally just have it in a centralized library and, like, we can automatically input it for you. But, like, at the highest level, it starts with why did you take this call and what are the challenges and and you said that. But then it's, like, getting deeper into how is this affecting your business overall. This is also still like an impact question. Like, what is the impact of not having a centralized library? How many days are you spending on responding to an RFP? I like the framework, man. Talk about the, required capabilities piece. And in particular, my guess is when they get on the call with you, they wanna know. So, like, what can you do? What can you do? What can you do? Like, how do you get them to talk about all that stuff before going into the required capabilities aspect? Yeah. So, essentially, like, the goal of this portion of the call is to really understand, like, what requirements they need in the solution for their ideal state. Right? So a few questions, like, you you wanna ask you and make sure that you're guiding them back to this and not just focusing on, like, features and and then taking control of the call would be things like again, specifically for Loopia. Like, what would you need in order to reduce the amount of time that it's taking you to complete an RFP? What would you need in order to make winning content widely available and reusable? One of the things I wanna ask about is, like, you're on this call. Right? And they've sort of articulated things. And I don't know if your SDRs have ever been in the position where they've got that initial discovery meeting, and you're trying to understand all of these things that they need and want. And sometimes you have prospects who are, like, sort of on the fence about maybe it can help. I'm not really sure. This meeting didn't totally, like, solidify it for me. And you're sitting there as a salesperson saying, I know if you saw this thing, like, it would help you. So how do you get that customer who's sort of on the fence to say, alright. I'll agree to a demo. Yeah. The way that we do this and and I think works the best is is kind of framing it into, like, what what do you really have to, like, lose scenario. And being like, hey. Listen. Like and maybe calling the emotion upfront. I think it's important to label thinking, like, hey. I'm sensing some hesitation right now. You told me that this is your current state. This is the three things that we can do for you. Would it be a terrible idea if we just got on a quick thirty minute demo? I showed you how we can make this process better for you. And then if you don't like it, happy to part ways. Make it easy for them to to say no. Give them the option, but also I don't wanna say, like, make it making them feel like it's unreasonable to say no, but you're just like, hey. Like, what do you really have to lose here? Right. I do something similar where, like, I kinda throw myself under the bus where I'm like, look, you've told me a couple of things here, and I'm a little bit biased because I sell this thing. But I think if you saw it for twenty five minutes, like, one of two things would happen. Either you say this is the worst thing since canned bread and Nick wasted twenty five minutes of my time or, oh, this thing looks like something we might actually want to explore. I guess, would you be against looking at it for a couple minutes? And so it's sort of the same thing as you where it's like, worst case scenario, you have a set I'll also say, like, worst case scenario, you have a sense of what else is out there, which is sort of what you're doing where it's like, I'm okay if you don't like it. Worst case scenario, you still get something from the meeting. Yeah. Exactly. And you can do the same thing when they mentioned that they're using a competitor. It's like, you wanna get them to a place where it's like, what do you have to lose? You know, it's like, it's great that you're using this competitor. They're actually fantastic. This is, like, three ways that we do things differently. Would it be a terrible idea just to see what we have to offer? If you don't like it, you can be comfortable with the fact that you went with the best solution possible. And that's worked many times for us. I love it, man. You've given me a lot of inspiration to start asking illuminating questions in my prospecting. Like, this has been one of the few episodes that, like, pushes me to change how I prospect. So I feel good about that. But we're running out of time, so we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is gonna be this, Lauren. Talked about a ton of good things that salespeople should be incorporating into the way that they work, and now we gotta talk about a bad habit. So I'm curious to hear from you. What is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople doing that you think they need to break because it's garbage and it's hurting them more than it's helping? I think it comes down to, like, time allocation. Like, not peep SDRs need to time block. You do so many different things in a day. You send hundreds of emails. You do hundreds of calls, a lot of LinkedIn messages. A lot of people just go into their day and they let the day consume them. You need to have a plan going into it every single day. From eight to 10AM, I'm calling. If I'm calling, I'm calling. That's all I'm doing. My phone notification's off. My Slack notifications are off. Nobody's bothering me. From ten to 10:15, I'm taking a break. Then after my break, I'm making I'm sending emails or whatever that might be. I'm making videos. I'm specifically prospecting. Be diligent about what you're doing every single hour and intentional. Have a goal or else, that day is gonna get ahead of you. I love it. Either you run the day or the day runs you. Florin, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? If you don't already, please follow me on LinkedIn. I try to post multiple times a week. Just like this podcast, I like to focus on actual tactical, actionable tips. I don't wanna give you fluff. That's been my my motto my my whole career. So thank you both so much, for having me. Everyone, go follow Florin. Comment on his posts. Maybe even throw him a like or the clapping hands thing, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Florin Tetullia include, number one, backload your sequences. So three calls, one day at a time, three emails, one day at a time. At the end of your sequence, that'll jack up your reply rates. Number two, have some heartbeat subject lines. And so one example that Florent gave was RFP deadlines. You have to open that as a sales leader. Number three, the calling tomorrow subject line. You say, hey. I'm gonna give you a call at 11:30AM tomorrow. You'll guaranteed probably get a reply out of it. And then lastly, number four, the command of the message framework. What is your current state? What are the negative consequences? What is the after state? And then what are the positive business outcomes? Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? Well, I can't guarantee that you'll probably get a reply to anything, which is what you said, which kind of made me chuckle. But anyways, Florin told me that he shared this podcast with his whole team, and that probably means that they're, I don't know, improving their outcomes as a team. So if you haven't shared the show with someone that you love and care about, please do so because it helps us grow and end up bringing more sponsors so we can make even more great 30 MPC content. Thanks for listening. We'll see you guys next week.
