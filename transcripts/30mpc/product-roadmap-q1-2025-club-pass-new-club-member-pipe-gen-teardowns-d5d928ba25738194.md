## Transcript

Oh, good morning, everybody, and welcome to this road map episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my host, Nick Sejalski. And folks, there is no better way to start the new year than with a gift for you that is going to help you build more pipeline than anyone else in the world. And so Nick, why should people listen? So in these roadmap episodes, we sort of give you the download on the state of all things 30. We are gonna cover three big things in this session. Number one, we're gonna talk about some new gifts that are coming from thirty MPC, some stuff coming down the line from us. From there, we're gonna get into the newest member of the thirty MPC club, which is the group of elite top 1% sellers that we frequently collaborate with, who host our sessions, etcetera. And then from there, we will get in to the q one tactic teardown lineup, AKA our webinars. So, folks, let's start with our first product launch since the book. For the longest time, people have been asking us, when are you gonna launch your first sales course? And the answer was for the longest time, we don't plan on launching a sales course because we believe that most sales courses are fundamentally broken with 15% completion rates, and they are glorified YouTube videos. And then, eventually, we started to think. Our audience is clearly asking us for a way to get better at sales, a way to structure all of the concepts that we teach at thirty MPC without having you listen to every single podcast one by one and look for all of that stuff. And so the club pass is that. The club pass is your step by step program to president's club. Actionable courses reinforced by weekly and monthly coaching and training sessions, and then powered by community accountability, can be surrounded by hundreds of other sellers who you can ask questions, enroll in challenges with, or even literally jump into a huddle with to jam on how to do a better cold call, how to do a better cold email, or how to run a better discovery call. So Nick, why don't you tell us a little bit more about the Club Pass? Well, Armand, you know, I really struggle with my pitch. And so I actually needed a little hand holding on this one. And so I got on a plane. I I flew to New York City to hang out with you. I made you book an entire podcast recording studio, and then we rerecorded the pitch about 57 different times. And it turned out to be a pretty good commercial. So instead of me bumbling through my pitch again, why don't we just roll that commercial here? If you're anything like me, nobody ever really taught you how to sell. Most sales training programs, they tell you things like, hey. When you get on with the customer, you've gotta make sure to uncover pain. And when you talk about our product, don't sell the features, but but sell the value of the product. And you're like, okay. Cool. I'm ready to do this thing. Then you get on a call with your prospect, and you realize nobody ever taught you what to say in order to get the deal closed. So what do most sales teams do? They hire an external trainer. And the problem is most of these on-site trainings literally go in one ear, out the other. Mhmm. And the biggest problem that I see with most sales teams out there is they spend 80% of their time teaching these teams all the bells and whistles, all these new concepts, and then they only spend 20% on the follow-up and the reinforcement and making sure that any of that stuff actually sticks. And so when I became a VP of sales, I I said, I'm gonna flip that ratio on its head. We're gonna spend 20% of our time training our team on how to sell, and we're gonna spend 80% of our time reinforcing it to make sure that it sticks. And what would happen at the end of the thirty days is I would see that our reps were literally going back, and they were winning the exact same deals that they lost thirty days prior. And so while that was traditionally only available to certain teams behind closed doors, we are now taking that entire training program and making it available to you and every other listener to thirty minutes to Presidents Club today. Right. And so if you haven't met us before, I'm Nick Sigelski, and this is Arman Faroque. Arman was a VP of sales who led a company called Pave from 0 to 13,000,000 in ARR in less than two years. I was a multiple time top enterprise rep selling 6 and 7 figure deals to very large law firms. And together, we run thirty minutes to presidents club, which is the world's number one sales podcast. And we also wrote an international best selling sales book called Cold Calling Sucks, and that's why it works. And we've got this Club Pass program designed to help you punch your ticket to President's Club. There's three pillars to this. The first pillar is we have the world's most practical, actionable, and usable sales courses that are designed to teach you step by step exactly what to say in any situation that you could encounter in sales. From there, to help you master your craft, we've got small group hands on coaching to make the little tweaks and get the nuances right for your sale or your product. And the last piece is we've got the club community, which is hundreds of other motivated sellers who are going through the exact same program, who are helping hold each other accountable by hopping in the 200 dial challenge together, or sharing scripts and templates so you don't have to come up with that stuff from scratch or maybe even helping each other out, workshopping a really tough negotiation where a second set of eyes is helpful. So folks, if you are not sure, we are literally taking all of the risk off the table. If you get in there, you take a course, you jump in a coaching session, you see the community, and you don't absolutely love what you are getting out of it, there is a thirty day money back guarantee. Send us an email, and we will not ask you a single question. So if you're ready to get started, grab your Hawaiian shirt, get ready, take a course, jump in a session because this is your step by step program to President's Club. So if you're excited about what we just talked about, we would love to have you in the thirty MPC club community. We'd love to see you engaging with the club pass program. There is a link in the show notes for you to go check it out for yourself if you wanna sign up and get in there. And if you're a leader, there's also ways that we can help you get your entire team enrolled in the club pass program. Check the show notes. There's some information and links on how you can actually do that. And no better way to wrap up the club pass announcement than with a new club member. Folks, he is one of the greatest guests we have ever had on thirty minutes to president's club of all time. He has been a multiple time recent guest this year alone. He is the number two global rep at all of Talkdesk, and I believe at the time of this publishing, he was shooting for the number one slot, and he just might have gotten it. He has done hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ARR in a single deal, and carries a massive quota, and he is also just a phenomenal human being. The one and only Johnny Larson, three time, four time 30 MPC guest. Nick, why is Johnny entering the club? There's a couple different things about Johnny that really really stand out with him as it relates to his selling ability. The first, you've got to recognize that Johnny is selling in an extremely competitive complex space, and he is selling in the New York City territory negotiating with some of the toughest COOs out there. And these people are fighting him on price. They are fighting him down on a very, very complex sale. And Johnny's ability to get direct with the customer, to say what he means and say it directly, and figure out is this a real deal or not, so that he's not wasting his time in the in the wrong place, is impeccable. I encourage you to go listen to his past episodes on the show, and you will hear the straight talk way that he speaks to his customer. There is zero waffling or sort of dancing around the issue. He gets straight to the point and frankly, more salespeople need to be direct the way that Johnny is. So I encourage you to go listen his style from that perspective. I also encourage you to pick up on the frankly hard to teach thing that he does, which is he is a phenomenal storyteller. Teller. If you listen to the way that he weaves in detail when he's even talking about selling best practices, the guy is really, really good and a lot of us stand to learn from him. So welcome Johnny Larson to the thirty MPC club. We are happy to have you here. So folks go check out links to all of Johnny's past appearances on thirty minutes to president's club in the show notes. Plus, if you're not familiar with what club members are, every quarter we plan out more content with our club members like Sarah Brasier, Morgan Ingram, Charlotte Johnson, Mark Koskalo, Kevin Dorsey, and many, many other amazing hall of fame members. And Johnny Larson will be making his way into our newsletter, more podcast episodes, and all these other things too. On that note, let's round this thing out with the q one, webinar lineup. Not webinars because no one calls these things webinars because no one wants to attend a webinar. We call them tactic tear downs here, which is real sales tactics torn down live in action where you can ask us questions, screen share things, all that jazz. So Nick, what do we have coming up for January? So in January, we are starting things off hot with some ways to help you build some real pipeline. We're going over the perfect cold call pitch formula to help you book one in four call connects. It's gonna be you, Armand, me, and our buddy, Jason Bay, talking through how you explain what the heck your product does in a way that does not sound like a Billy Mays commercial, but actually resonates with your prospect and gets them to say, tell me more. And folks, if you wanted a preview into our first course, which is a cold calling course, we are literally taking slides and screenshots from that course so you can get a sneak peek. Next up, in February, we have a cold email clinic on how to break through the noise in 2025, and that is led by two cold email legends. Number one, Charlotte Johnson, top AE at SalesLoft, multiple time 30 MPC guest, and the one and only Kyle Coleman, formerly CMO over at Clari, currently CMO over at Copy AI, and one of the best 30 MPC guest of all time again. Two of the greatest tearing down cold emails, and Charlie is actually a club coach inside of the Club Pass community. And so if you wanna get a sense of how she is literally coaching reps inside of the community every single week, this is a sneak peek as well. Nick, what do we have next? So February, we've got one for the leaders listening to 30 MPC. So we're going to be talking about how to train and upskill a president's club caliber team. And this is a special work stuff. And this is a special workshop style tactic tear down led by the one and only Katie Kevin Dorsey. So if you wanna figure out how to take all of those selling best practices that you hear on 30 MPC, that you know that some of your top performers do, and you wanna figure out how to codify and systematize and get those into all of your reps brains, this is one that I would recommend joining. And then lastly, in March, we have the one and only Morgan Ingram, who is literally driving the most tactical screen share you could imagine in your life. It is a workshop on sales nav secrets to get an extra meeting per week. Morgan is literally going to pull up LinkedIn sales navigator and walk through all the funky filters, notifications you can do to find the prospects in your territory with the highest propensity to buy. And it is a clinic in identifying the hottest leads in your patch, not spraying and praying. I wish I had had that one when I was a new seller, Arman, because I remember when I was new to sales, my boss was like, hey, here's your sales nav license. And I like logged on once and I was like, I don't know what to do with this. And I literally never used it again. We were just throwing money in the trash. And what I know now, what Morgan's taught me about using sales nav, I'm like, gosh, I'd be driving a nicer car if I had actually learned how to use that one. So folks, you should join that one so that you can move from a Honda Civic to a Honda Accord, which is what I would love to do one day. High aspirations here, folks. So to recap, you have your club pass. Go to 30mpc.combackslashclubpass. Everyone, please, if you get the chance, listen to one of Johnny's episodes and go connect with Johnny Larson on LinkedIn. Give him a warm welcome to the club, and tell him the thing that you liked about his episode the most. And then lastly, all of the links to all of the q one tactic teardowns are inside of the show notes as well. Folks, it's gonna be an awesome start to the New Year. This one is all focused on building pipeline. This episode drops in January, and so the first thirty days of this quarter are going to be what generate the next ninety days of pipeline. So if there is a time to go pedal to the metal, it is right now. We are stoked to have an awesome 2025 with you guys at thirty minutes to Presidents Club. We will catch you on the flip side. Peace.
