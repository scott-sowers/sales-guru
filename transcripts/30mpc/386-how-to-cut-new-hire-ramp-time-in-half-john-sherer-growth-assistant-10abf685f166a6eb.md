## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my co host, Mark Casaglow. And I'm also here in person in studio with one of our hall of fame sales leadership guest, John Scherer. And so we have a two part special for you folks. This first episode is going to focus on how you should onboard your reps, and then the second episode is going to focus on once they're onboarded, what are all the different metrics that you need to look at as a sales leader to make sure that things are actually going well. So in this first one, Mark, why should people listen? So we were just going over John's history, and I think it's super interesting. He started at HubSpot and went through IPO. That's like the tippity top. Then he went to help take Lattice from 20 to one twenty. That's like taking it a notch down, but a totally different type of learning. And then he went on to help somebody do zero to 10,000,000. I think very few people have that breadth of experience in their sales career, and I think you'll hear in this episode how it directly applies to onboarding. Let's go. And three, two, one. Let's ride. Alrighty, John. Welcome back to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. Number one, communicate your comp plans one to one. Not in a big group. Please not in an email. That is self explanatory. What's number two? You're working in person, get a big whiteboard, write all your top deals on the whiteboard, and every day, stand in front of the whiteboard and ask people questions about the deals. It's fun. It's engaging. Work on your handwriting. Bother people all the time. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Great takeaways so far. Bother people all the time. What's number three? Number three is, if you have a awesome manager who was previously a rep, let them onboard all your reps. Let them own demo certs. Make sure they're the ones that teach people how to sell your product. Before we get into the meat of the issue, I wanna talk about this deal whiteboard thing. What happens, first of all, when those deals are visible for reps? Like, what is a rep what do you think a rep's thinking when that thing's up on the board every day? I better be moving that deal. I better know what's up with that deal. I'm thinking about it. It's top of mind. I you know, I'm, like, paranoid about it. I think a little healthy paranoia is good. Yeah. I also like to write the next step next to the deal name. Mhmm. So it's always deal name, next step, then I color code it if it's a good next step. If it's it's green, it's a bad next step. It's red. And are you, like, walking the hallways up and down each aisle, like, tapping on the board incessantly? Like, how are you approaching a conversation with the whiteboard so that people aren't, like, freaked out? Or maybe they are freaked out. Maybe you wanna freaked out. Yeah. Well, you know, I, I'm a person who never has a desk. I can't sit still in one place. If I'm in a if I'm in taking a call, I'm usually in a meeting room. And so I do a lot of pacing around the office. So I'm just constantly chirping, talking to people, looking at the whiteboard, asking questions, and I tend to do it in a big group, anytime I see people are free or on the call. So I don't sit much. I tend to pace a lot. And so the whiteboard works great for me because I can just point at it all the time. Transitioning because when we were prepping, Armand and I were kinda talking, and there's this meaty issue that I think is gonna take most of this conversation. And this is a good transition. So you have your best manager who is a great rep train every rep. That sounds the most, like, the most unscalable, most horrible onboarding program ever. Like, help me understand why you're doing that. I mean, it's really expensive to hire reps. You miss onboarding somebody successfully. The cost is enormous, especially you hiring two two to three reps a quarter, and one to two of those ends up failing. You're gonna miss your number on the year. Right? And so what's more important than making a new rep successful fast? I'd I'd argue nothing. And so I'm gonna take my best resource, person who knows my sale the best, and I'm gonna put up to 50% of their time into training and onboarding new reps. I don't think there's anything they can do with their time that's more important, period. I think what happens a lot of times is there's things that are happening inside the business that put pressure on us in revenue and specifically sales to do things that aren't quite natural. Why don't you share a little bit about why you think that that's a bad idea? Because I think I agree with you. Yeah. I mean, one, I I like the machine reference. I like process. I think it's super important in certain places, but I also think it becomes a term scale or we need to prepare for IPO that becomes really dangerous. It it almost is like a something that people can use to justify anything that they wanna work on, and it's difficult to push back against. But I actually think collectively that adds up over time and gets super dangerous. And onboarding reps is one of those places. I think a lot of enablement related activities are those places. And so, generally, what I've seen is, scale can be really effective in some places. But a lot of times, our two to three to five year revenue projections don't come true. Most of us aren't Stripe. Most of us aren't OpenAI. That that plan that says we're adding 50 reps next year, how often does that actually come to fruition? How much time do we as revenue leaders actually spend building towards a future that is really not gonna happen when actually we should be trying to make as much money as we can for the business right now and that maybe delay the scale stuff until it's needed. I think one of my learnings is, like, I'd rather be a little late to scalability and focus more on capturing maximum revenue now, and I think that'll have a better long term effect on the business. But it's tough to push back against as a leader when somebody's like, are you ready for IPO? Oh, you're not doing a good enough job scaling. Right? Because, Mark, you've been there. Right? As somebody who's a a leader who's been in there early and tried to hold on to that job for years so they don't, you know, they don't top you, One of the things they tell you is, like, do you know how to scale? Yeah. Well, they top taught me, and I didn't know how to scale. But guess who they always brought in to fix it? So I wanna dig in on this, and and I'm gonna come back to this making the manager onboard half of your sales organization because I wanna understand how you actually do that. But first, let's give some bad examples of process. I've also been part of a sales organization where one executive in another division came from a MEDDPIC team. They came in. They saw that our sales team wasn't doing MEDDPIC. And they're like, we're at 10,000,000 ARR. Why aren't we doing MEDDPIC? The next thing you know, I gotta go talk to command of the message and all these force management people. And I'm like, I don't I've never been a Medpick guy myself, but now, apparently, I'm expected to bring in this kind of process and 17 letter methodology. And so talk to me about what is the wrong type of process to be bringing in, or what are some bad examples of process? Oh, man. You're triggering me. Medpick on your three k deals? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I've done this one. I did the command of the message one too. Right? I I rolled out command of the message. I wasted half $1,000,000 on it, thousands of selling hours, and it and it moved the needle not at all. Right? And then I look back. I'm like, why did I make that decision? One, I made the decision because somebody above me recommended it to me, and I didn't know what else to do. And it was like, they've got a strong they've got strong conviction on this. I I went and talked to a bunch of people who loved command of the message. Like, it's totally valid. But what what didn't what I didn't understand is that I didn't understand command of the message. How am I gonna roll it out? None of my managers were trained on this. I was not trained on this. I did not grow up as a seller in this environment, but then I rolled it out anyways. And I put everybody through the training. I went through it myself, but, like, it wasn't enough. I didn't have true conviction and belief that it was going to work and and that I knew how to make it work because I had never done it or experienced it. But it was the right thing to do for scale. It was, something that a lot of elite organizations do really successfully. But for me, I grew up in a different world, the different selling style, not with MEDDPIC, not with Command of the Message. And so if I'm gonna lead a revenue organization, I have to play to my strengths. And instead, I spent six months of all of our enablement time, an enormous amount of our managers' time. Every executive in the company had to come come on-site for this thing. And, like, I don't think it got us a point on conversion. Let's dive into this because I think this is a great example of, like, alright. We need to uplevel the team, everybody. What do we do? We bring in Medpick. Pick. We bring in a come into the message. We bring in whatever it is. Right? And that's gonna uplevel the team when the team's already performing well. Like, give me the circumstances around, like, how many reps? Where were you about revenue wise? Like, you know, give me some idea of, like, when this started to come. What what was the circumstances? 80,000,000 in revenue, 60 to 70 reps, North America plus EMEA, you know, on the triple, triple, double, double, double path. Early twenty twenty two is when we made the decision. So sort of pre things starting to slow down. So we still think that we're going from, like, 80 to one sixty the next year. Right? And and so, obviously, like, that changed for for almost all of us. But, like, a lot of momentum A lot of momentum and style. Like, at Lattice, we had our own style. We had things that worked for us. They were atypical. Some people would come into our sales organization and be like, this is how you do discovery. But, like, what what do you want me to do? I've got 38% close rates. Yeah. HR is a unique buyer. We've got something that works here versus trying to, like, shove in what every other sales organization tells you you should do into your own business, I think, was was was a point of failure for us. Like, if you had to go back in time and whisper into your own ear, don't do this. Do this. What would be the what would you tell yourself? I mean, if I knew 2022 was, gonna shape up in the back half of the year, the way it did, I'd change a lot. More than anything, I would I would lean into who the best sellers were in my organization longer. Like we had something that worked to onboard 50 to 60 successful reps. I mean, we probably hired 80 or 80 to a 100 over the years. Right? Like it was working. And we decided that at some point that wasn't going to work anymore. And so preemptively brought in command of the message. But I would have just taken it to the point of failure with what we were already doing. And, like, let us fail for a quarter rather than pivot before we need to pivot. You talked about you had your own style of selling. It was Lattice style selling. And at Pave, we built a style of selling, and it was Pave style selling. And it was an amalgamation of a lot of different processes that I learned and other reps had learned from other teams. But it's sort of like with a cast iron. You keep cooking food in there, and then over time, like, this pan ends up seasoning after years and years and years and years into a style that is perfectly fitted for your organization. And so I think the takeaway for folks here is that as if you have a sales process that is working for your organization and it's proven, just because it doesn't have a trademarked name and a $500,000,000 training behind it does not mean that bringing a more standardized process from the outside in your organization would be better for your company. In fact, it might be worse because the stuff that you've already built is tailor made to your sales process. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. So you talked about having one manager onboard 50% or half of the reps or 20 reps or spend 50% of their time onboarding people in the organization. The problem is your best manager is also managing a team of eight of their own reps. And so, operationally, how do you actually get them to step away from their quota, the reps that they're managing, and carve out the time to train everyone else who's onboarding? It's a great question. I mean, one, this person's probably not working forty hours a week. Let's be real. Yeah. Yeah. Person's grinding, and they probably want a path to growth. And that's how this is and how they're gonna find the motivation to do this most likely. But but what I'd argue is, like, if you get a rep up and running in those first three to six months successfully, you have less work to do downstream. So if this person has onboarded all eight of these reps and gone deep for their first six months, he's probably running deal desk for the rest of them, doing coaching plans here and there, but they're running the business the way he wants them to run the business. And so I think he's in a different position than somebody who might have, like, recently inherited a team or who, like, handed these reps to enablement and then got them and then needed to figure out how to onboard them. And so I think that upfront investment actually makes things easier long term. You know, the other piece is I wouldn't say this person should do 100% of the onboarding. They should do everything to do with selling, market education, persona training, some basic product training. I think you can outsource to other parts of the organization. But how to demo? What to demo? When to demo? What questions to ask? What, like, what are those, like, little nuance y phrases that your organization has come up with that, like, random reps came up with that people have been copying for years? Right? Like, those things should come from the person who knows the sale absolutely the best. And guess what? They're also accountable for these people's revenue number. It's super aligned. Right? Everybody wins if this works, but it's hard. Takes a lot of work. I think one important thing that stood out is I think about the types of training in terms of industry, product, and sales training. So industry training is, for example, how does a stock option work if I was selling equity management software at Carta? And the industry training can oftentimes be taught by enablement. This is like vocabulary. Yeah. What's a performance review? How many ratings are in a performance review? You can learn that stuff over time. But once you start to get into finesse, how do you demo the product in a way that doesn't sound like you're literally reading off a list of 10 features? How do you artfully pull out the right stories in your discovery? That's when you need to have your best reps and your best managers leaving those ones. And I think oftentimes enablement struggles with that a little bit because they wanna take this stuff off of the leaders' plates. They wanna take this stuff off the reps' plates. But, Mark, I know you've had some perspectives as well. I'm curious to hear about how you think about enablement's role when it comes to onboarding and actually running these trainings themselves. Over the years, my relationship with, enablement went from great. Now I have somebody that can train reps, and I don't have to think about it. That is the worst view of enablement that you can have. Two, hey. This is somebody that can look at the numbers with me. It's a second brain, a second set of eyes that can help me pinpoint what's wrong. And my job is to work with them on how we're gonna fix it. And then their job is to to to supply and create all of the support materials that my team needs to go execute on that. How you train the reps is secondarily important into how the managers manage the reps. How are you using enablement inside of that when you have, like, alright. You know, manager Bob, your job is to, like, help onboard reps. How does in how does enablement support them? I think enablement, you know, is making sure that the product content is available for it to be taught once. Right? Because I think what we gotta remember about sellers, not always the people who, like, are super academic in the way that they learn. Right? So, normally, somebody needs to see the content in a deck once. Then then they need to watch you do it once, and then they need to do it themselves once. And so you got to hit somebody with content multiple times. And so I think there is a first round of content of, like, hitting them with product information, hitting them with buyer information, covering some case studies that that is valuable to be shared via enablement. But all of that needs to be talked about multiple times. This isn't a one and done type of thing. Most people need to hear things a bunch of times. I know I do. Right? And I need to say it out loud probably before I even really, really learn it. And that reinforcement and the the art of it all needs to happen, in my opinion, with their their sales leader, whether that's a manager or director, whoever you think is the best person to teach them. And then we always pair them with a buddy. And the buddy thing is is actually very important as well because that's the person that's gonna join a few of their first sales calls. They're gonna join all of that reps first calls for a while. And buddy selection is something that's that's actually, like, another artful thing. Right? Like, you gotta you interview somebody in a process. You gotta think about who on your team today best matches their style because you're gonna have reps that sell differently. Right? Not everybody's the same. And so you really wanna match people who they can, like, look in the mirror and be like, oh, I can copy that guy. We've got similar swagger. Like, our energy is really similar, and you wanna buddy those people up together. And I think that combination of, like, a little bit of enablement early on, ton of manager, direct training, running the demo search, etcetera, and then giving them a buddy that they're on the call with really consistently is a winning combination. And I think it I think it scales really far. I I would have I I would've loved to see how far we could've pushed it. Yeah. It might never have broken, but you never got to see. Yeah. Yeah. Because somebody's so worried about it breaking that they ended up wasting a bunch of time trying to prevent something that might never have broken. Right? Could you talk about this buddy program a little bit more? Because I've seen this go wrong where I pair upbeat, outspoken, extroverted Nick with introverted middle performer person who has Me. Me. And I'm like, go be buddies. And they do a coffee chat on the first day, and then next thing you know, they never meet again. And there's no rhyme or reason or no no way that you've actually guided those buddies to onboard one another. So how do you set them up and set that program up for success? One, I think personality selection is really important. And if that means one of your reps ends up being a buddy for half your new reps, like, cool. I don't see a problem with that at all. Yeah. Two, you gotta give them instructions. Like like right? Like, new person, you're joining all of Anthony's calls for the first three weeks. And then, Anthony, you're joining three of their calls a week as they get started. Right? So I think instruction is really important during onboarding. Another place I really like to use buddies is anytime you're rolling out a new initiative. So at Lattice, when I joined, we were 92% inbound. The goal was over a period of a couple years to get fifty fifty inbound, outbound. Guess what? Certain reps are better than outbound than others. And so what we would do is we would do a buddy program every month when we'd roll out a new outbound strategy or a new outbound metric, and we take the reps who are better at outbound, and we pair them to high potential reps who weren't outbounding, and we'd give them shared metrics for the week. And so, again, the buddy program there is you're having somebody who knows how to do something, teach somebody else who's not great at doing it, but also putting some mutual accountability, making them a team, in order to make the change. And that worked pretty successfully. I think about, like, one rat who never got on board with all of that hit such a high close rate. He never really had to. But, otherwise, that worked really well. Talk about these shared metrics. Could be anything. Could be dials for the week. Could be pipeline. I always liked intro meetings completed. That's, like, my favorite metric for everything. But it's like, hey. Like, you guys need to get two intro meetings completed between this SMB team meeting and the next next SMB team meeting. And it's like, alright. Figure it out. I think a a common theme in this conversation has been don't mess up the train that's going in a direction at a certain speed and getting you good results just because you're worried that there might be a track a few miles down that is messed up. Like, just keep the train running. And the way you keep the train running is the people that are on the train are the ones helping to bring on the new cars and the new not to take the metaphor too far, but you know what I mean? Like, you you're a I go with what got me here type of leader. Aren't you? I am. I think I've learned that, though, because I I do really believe in the the phrase what what got us here won't get us there. Right? I I I think that's super real. I believe believe in evolving. When I was at HubSpot, there was a photo of the CEO in the lobby that said, chief pothole officer, and I've internalized that deeply. Like, I've always thought of my job as, like, where is this gonna break in six months, and how can I go and find that? But I think that there's this particular niche where that there needs to be an exception, and that is, like, when you have great people accomplishing really high value things, don't mess it up. Let it be. Right? There's always place for process. Right? There's always places where you can see something breaking in the future, like how many accounts people own or, like, the way accounts get rotated. Of course, you need you need to, like, constantly be evolving that as you scale, what numbers you look at, whatever it is. But when you have great individuals doing something very high leverage in the business, I would get away from that much more slowly than I I thought I had to when I was scaling revenue teams. It's it's so strange. I just talked to a buddy of mine named Scott Barker, and I think I had the right name. I think he called it Parkinson's law, which says if you take the square root of the number of employees, that number is doing 80% of the work of the entire company. And I think you're that's what you're saying. Like, listen. I had a 100 person sales team. About 10 people were, like, doing all the training, doing all this, and they want it. You lean on them. They want you to lean on them, and that keeps the train going. But when you're like, well, we're we're too sufficient on there. These guys got us to a 100,000,000, but are they gonna get us to 250,000,000? We need to bring in some more people. That's when everything come the wheels start to come off. Right? I I totally agree with that. Yeah. I think the best people at for a fast growth growth environment want to be rewarded with responsibility. And I call it a personal failure when I'm not when I don't have those people loaded with more responsibility than they can handle. I wanna push there. I I was I'm grateful that at a point in time, I was pushed in that way. Yeah. And that helped me accelerate the leadership elements of my career. And so when somebody's when I think they're ready for that and they want that, like, I'm gonna push them as hard as I can with responsibility. At Outreach, I think one of the things that I helped our culture have was this idea of it's a leader's job to step back. When you step back, it creates a vacuum. A vacuum is gonna suck somebody into it, and then that's when you get to see, can they do it or not? And if you're not constantly stepping back, then nobody's stepping forward. And if nobody's stepping forward, you're always gonna be doing the same job. And the best way to get fired as a VP of sales is always be doing the same job. Once you get caught in that rut, your ass is out of here. Right? But if you're just stepping back, alright. I know I can create the best demo ever, but I'm gonna let this great rep come in and put their stamp on it, and they get sucked up into that vacuum. And the next thing you know, like, everybody's in love with the demo again because you let somebody that had as much legitimacy as you help create it. Right? Versus, well, I'm gonna always own the demo. You know what I mean? And that's when sales leaders get stuck. And once you get stuck, you can't grow with your company. If you can't grow, you die. But there's such an art to that. Right? Because that's what we're talking about is this this guy, Justin, who ran all of this onboarding. Right? Like, should he have stepped back to let another manager step in? Like, I'm arguing. No. But there are times where, like, I needed to step back. So when when Justin started making hiring decisions for his team and I stopped making hiring decisions, I had to step back. Yeah. To Justin, like, you make this call. Like, do I think this is the right rep? I'm not necessarily gonna tell you. I want you to start to work on your pattern recognition here. And so there's an art to that, and I think it's a difficult art. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Sean, when I think about some of the takeaways around onboarding to round this thing out, we have best reps, best managers, running trainings as long as you can. Enablement is helping them coordinate those things. Pairing the personalities of top reps with newer reps so that they continue to learn all this tribal knowledge. And what both you have come back to is saying that on one side, but on the other side, you can't have no process or make sure that you're not solving the problem that's gonna hit you in six months. And so I think what would be helpful for the audience is if you give an example of, like, what good looked like at Lattice in your onboarding program, could you give a high level frame for what onboarding looked like, where you would have where you would do unscalable things in the program versus where are the places where you would have a little bit more process around documentation, standardizing the decks, certifications, things like that. What what what's your right amount of process onboarding program? We had a certifications program. You were not allowed to get leads until you had passed two certifications. One, that you could run an intro call. Two, that you could run a demo. You're not getting leads. You can fail it once? Fine. You could fail it twice? Fine. Cannot fail it a third time. Maybe you can if you're a BDR and you're trying to move up to an AE. It might give you a little more leeway, but, like, it's also, you know, a catch at the same time for people who aren't gonna be successful in the organization. So that process exists very fundamentally. We also like, you want somebody to feel welcome on day one. You want them to learn about the culture. We had great values at Lattice. We wanted people to spend time about the values. We wanted the people to spend time learning our persona. Like, that had process. Somebody's first two weeks, the non sales stuff, lots of process in there. Super important, helpful. It's nice to spread that out among multiple people. It also gives them the chance to meet leaders in other departments. I think that type of work is great. But when it comes to selling, that's where it's like, alright. Like, you know, that is sort of like a like a master and apprentice relationship where the master has to understand what are this what is this person's strengths and weaknesses, and they need to have the freedom to do what they need to do to get this person to that intro cert and then to that demo cert, and then ultimately feel comfortable enough giving them their leads. They're currently going to people with acceptable conversion rates. So in in a way, there's a risk there, and I like putting that responsibility onto the person who's gonna end up carrying that rep's quota. So what would that look like if I'm a manager and I wanted to get my rep ready today over the next couple of weeks to pass an intro search? What do you tell them to do? I mean, one, you need to determine what does a good intro look like to you. So once you've determined, hey. Like, this is what we think good discovery looks like. This is the type of information that we want to draw out. Then what I would do is I'd have them listen to a sales call, show it to them, and then I'd start explaining it to them. Hey. This is why we ask this question. This is why we ask this question. This is why we ask this question. You give it a shot. Lot of, like, that mock back and forth. And while you're doing this, they're, like, joining their buddies' calls throughout, so it's being reinforced. And then you do their first practice session for the intro call, then their next practice session for the intro call. I think it's it's very kinetic. It's very doing based. I think the most important point of that is is the why. Like, I can't tell you I would teach somebody something or we go through something and they would sorta get it. But when I'm like, alright. Let's listen to a call together, and I'm gonna pause it and tell you exactly why we did this. Alright. Now go a little bit for the pause. Why did we do this? When people have that why, then they understand the what way better, and then they then they do the what. But when they're just like, okay. I see what John's telling me to do. I understand why, like, I in some weird way why he's telling me to do it, but I don't understand, like, exactly why. And when that's ambiguous, people don't act. To to be very specific, you know, the way that I always think about discovery is I'm trying to bucket somebody. And so the questions that I'm gonna ask are gonna put them in a different bucket. Right? For example, one business that I'm I'm working for right now sells offshore talent. And so one of the things that I fundamentally need to understand is have they done this before or not? Because then my next set of questions is gonna be different. The way I'm gonna sell them is gonna be different. And so the the same thing was true at Lattice. Like, we had people, like, are you doing performance reviews today? Are you not doing performance reviews today? Are you doing this, like, using Google Sheets versus technology? Those types of things are gonna change the way that we sell. And so my favorite method of teaching, is through bucketing. I like a good bucket. Buckets are easy. And I think over time, we all develop those four buckets become eight buckets become, you know, 16 buckets. And they're more nuanced and they're harder to teach, but, like, that's what repetition does. That's what, you know, that's what experience can do in a role. But starting off with some high level buckets is a huge advantage. I really think way too many onboarding programs, like you said, spend way too much in the learn it phase. In other words, they're focused on the discovery decks and the academic or the theoretical framework behind how to run a discovery call. And the way that I think about the different steps are, number one, you need to learn it. Number two, you need to see it. So you need to see someone do this in a discovery tape and pause at the key moments and understand why they're doing those things. Number three, then you need to do it. And then number four, you need to do it right through coaching. And the problem is way too many people think that the hard part is learning it. And most people can describe what they should be doing inside of a discovery call. Very few people can actually execute that in a way that feels not cringey and fluid and doesn't come off like you're trying to lead people into a sales trap. And so teach them the frameworks as quickly as humanly possible, but then get them watching someone doing it the right way and doing it themselves as quickly as humanly possible because there are way too many sales academics who understand what they should be doing, but they can't actually put it into practice. Yeah. And and one thing I'd add there that I think is a helpful tactical thing for people building out these programs is, like, our ramp quotas were fixed. So say there's a three month ramp quota. You know, your goal is to bring in a $100,000 of revenue in those three months. If you onboard yourself faster and you pass these demo certs faster, you're getting leads on week two. Yeah. You take your time. You might get leads on week four. Guess what's not gonna change? Your ramp quota. Yeah. You wanna crush that ramp quota, you need leads. Better learn fast. So I think a little, like, pressure there can be really useful too. Like, this isn't a chill time. This is a serious time. John, awesome show. We have to move to the final question. We talked about a lot of good habits, but what is one bad habit that every sales leader should break so that all teams can get a little bit better? Saying hey on Slack and not following up with why you're reaching out, it's the worst. Right? You're like, yo. Nothing else. You're like, what do you what? What? Dude, you're just driving your reps insane. It's such a messed up thing to do. Hey. Just fucking write what you mean. Hey. I wanna talk to you about this deal. You know? Like, that shit's brutal. Completely unrelated bad habit, but an amazing show. John, this was a blast, man. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Mark. It is time for a two by two recap from this episode with John Cher. What do you have for your two? Two by two, number one, is I love the fact that, he's using the buddy system. I've used it in most places I've done. But what I think that John's doing that I'd never considered is during the interview process, I'm also interviewing with who should be their buddy. And I just think starting out that way creates a way better match. And when that match is great, it's a great, it's a great little program to run. If that match isn't good, it it kinda disappears into nothing. And the second thing is is John, doesn't appear to be scared of taking one person and saying your job and your the company's relying on you to onboard reps correctly. I don't think that any company in the world would rather have a 100 reps if it took 200 hires to get there. If it could get 85 hires and only a 100 reps, it's just way way better for everybody from a cost perspective, from a culture perspective. And I love that he's just very dedicated to onboarding reps and using those resources the right way. Number three, two certifications. You have an intro call certification. You have to be able to run an introductory call, and then you have to be able to run a demo call. And if you cannot, you do not get leads. And then lastly, number four, when you're training your reps, you gotta teach them the fundamentals of how to run good discovery, but then you gotta get them watching tapes and shadowing those calls with their buddies as soon as humanly possible. And then you need to make them go do a million role plays. Way too many trainings are focused on academic classroom style learning instead of getting the rep doing. And if they wanna pass the certification, they are not going to pass the certification staring at Google Slides. Alrighty, folks. If you like this one, a couple weeks ago or a few months ago, I broke down our entire multi week onboarding program that we use back at PAVE. And so if you want something a little bit more tangible where you can see an actual onboarding schedule, a lot of those principles are at play. There's a link to that down in the show notes, and we will catch you on the next one. Peace.
