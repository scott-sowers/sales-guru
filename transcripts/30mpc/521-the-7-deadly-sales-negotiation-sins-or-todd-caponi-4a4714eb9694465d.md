## Transcript

So if you think that discounting accelerates your deals, if you think a case study is a good reason to give your customer a discount, or if you think that you need to hold off on sharing the price until you've established value, you are committing one of the seven deadly negotiation sins. I'm Todd Capone, longtime sales leader and in my previous life as a sales rep closing 7 and 8 figure deals. I've seen lots of big mistakes being made in negotiating, whether it's the massive deals or the teeny tiny ones. The things I'm gonna take you through here, they apply to both, so buckle up. And a lot of this is laid out in my newest book, Four Levers Negotiating. It was actually the most popular chapter in my first book, the award winning The Transparency Sale. I think it's chapter 11 on transparent negotiating, but we go really, really deep in my new book, Four Levers Negotiating. That'll be available soon. The number one deadly negotiation mistake that I see happen all of the time is this idea that we've been taught to never share the price until the customer thinks it's more. Makes me wanna cry myself to sleep at night even thinking about. I want you to think about this idea that the term sticker shock has never been associated with anything good in the history of humankind. What I would highly recommend is during initial conversations with your potential customers, to be able to set a pricing expectation, to set a range with them. And here's what I mean. When the customer is first investigating your solutions to be able to tell them, hey. Based on your organization and what you're trying to achieve, our understanding is that your price investment's probably gonna be between x and y. As we go through, we will get much more specific. But if that's way off of your expectations, can we talk about that now versus later? And the lesson for you in that is if you're talking about a 6 or a 7 figure solution to a 4 or a 5 figure buyer, one of you is in the wrong discussion. Don't you wanna know that now? And if you are in that wrong discussion, it provides this opportunity for your buyer if they're really bought in and you are acting as the guide in a confident way to become your guide within the organization to make this a bigger deal and to get to that power that can take you to that 6 or 7 figure deal. So you might be thinking, well, I haven't established the value yet. A few weeks ago, in the mail, we received a little card, and it was for a house that was going for sale down the street. And what was interesting to me is that on the card, they didn't list the price at all. And so, me being kind of the jackass that I am, I found the realtor's email address and sent them a note and said, hey. Listen. When you send a card like that to everybody, you have no idea whether or not that is actually resonating with them because all of our brains, what we're trying to do is make a prediction. Is the juice going to be worth the squeeze? When I see this house and I have no idea what the price could be, I was not even in the market. But without having a range that my brain could file this, I don't know if this is good or not. Why would I spend the time on it? So I sent the email to the realtor. They replied, oh, that was an oversight. Yeah. Sure. It was. Share the price. Do it up front. Set that range in the buyer's mind and find these customers coming to you that are already prequalified because, otherwise, they're either ignoring you when they could be a fit or they're bothering you and asking for that pricing range when you could have given it to them anyway. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. The second deadly negotiation mistake that I see all the time, and I'm sure you do too, is this idea that discounts accelerate deals. I would actually argue they slow down deals. Let me tell you a quick little story. I'm wearing a sweater right now. This is my favorite sweater. Well, last November, early November, like a dummy, I washed it and then I dried it. And I didn't realize it until it was time to unfold the laundry. And so I'm looking at this little destroyed sweater, and I'm like, oh, gosh. I can't believe I did this. I went on to bananarepublic.com, which is where I bought this, and noticed they still had the sweater, my color, my size. Awesome. But remember, it was the November. I would have to be an absolute dummy to buy it then. Why? Because within two weeks is Black Friday, and we know that on Black Friday, forty, fifty, 60% is coming off of that. I just need to wait a couple of weeks to save a little money. So that discount didn't accelerate. It actually slowed us down. What are you doing when you are offering quarter end discounts, especially early in the quarter? Your buyer's brain is going, they just told me that that end of month is gonna be really important. I'm gonna wait until the last possible minute, and then I'm gonna ask for the world because I know if it's this easy right now, it's gonna get even easier at the end of the quarter to ask and get a better deal. So I would argue that, ironically, your discounts aren't speeding up your deals, actually slowing them down. So instead of the fake expiring discount that happens at the end of the month or the end of the quarter, what I would recommend you do is start paying your customers to help you forecast. Here's what that sounds like. There is tremendous value in your ability to forecast. Right? Not only from a personal perspective, but organizationally. Your company has gotta make investments. They've gotta resource this deal. They've gotta be able to predict. That's why quarter forecast matter so much. So here's what to do instead. To tell your customer, hey, listen. There's tremendous value in our ability to forecast our business. If you are willing to mutually align around when you think you can get this done, we can pay you in the form of a discount to hold to it. And now what have you done? The customer now has skin in the game around that timing. That's number one. But number two is they now understand the why. It's not just some fake expiring discount that will be there next month, next quarter, whenever they want it. Instead, it's actually aligned around something that matters, and you've explained the why. And I'm telling you, you're going to find that your customers align to their own timing a lot tighter than you trying to artificially create it and accelerate your deal. So mistake number three is this idea that, hey, you know what? I don't care about all of this stuff. There's certain things that don't matter, so I'm just gonna give it away. And then I think that that's actually accelerating my deals, but it's making it harder. Here's what I mean. So often, organizations and the reps themselves look at things like pricing terms as an easy giveaway. Meaning, your standard pricing terms are net 30 and the customer says, well, ours is net 60. What do we do? We immediately go, we could do net 40 5. Would that work? What have you just told the customer? You think that's an easy thing that accelerates your deal, but you've actually just told your customer that your price isn't the price and that there are easy things they just have to find. So instead of you thinking that's accelerated the deal, now the customer is asking for more stuff. Because what do they wanna do? They wanna commit to as little technology product services as possible. They wanna pay as slowly as possible. They wanna commit to the shortest period if possible, and they wanna sign whenever the heck they want. And the minute you have signaled that the price isn't the price, on comes the onslaught, and they're gonna start asking for more and more. So instead, what do you do? You align it to something that is valuable. So for you to be able to explain to a customer when they say, hey, our net payment terms are net 60, that's our standard. For you to be able to walk back and tell them, hey, listen, cool, I understand. Our pricing and our pricing model is based on net 30 payment terms. If you want net 60, you can have it, but something's going to have to be adjusted to make up for it. That adjustment could be committing to more technology product services, could be committing to another year. It could be helping you to forecast. All I'm saying is don't just give away stuff for free just because they asked. It's eroding their credibility that they have in your pricing model and slowing down your deals instead of speeding them up. So every for profit company in the world, yours included, your pricing model and your entire business is based on four levers. Those four levers are number one, volume. You want your customers to commit to more volume. So more product, more technology, more services versus less. Right? More good, less That is good. Lever number two is the timing of cash or how fast they pay. Bet you anything your company likes money. Who knew? The faster your companies pay for your products, technology, and services is better than them paying more slowly. Lever number three is the length of commitment or how long they commit to your products, technology, and services. The longer they commit, probably better versus making shorter commitments. And number four is the timing of the deal or that value in your ability to predict, not only from an investment perspective, but from a resourcing perspective. There is tremendous value in mutual alignment around the timing. When you can forecast more accurately, that's good. When you can't, not as good. Those should be the four things that drive your company if you're a for profit company, but that should also be the basis for your entire pricing model. When you lay that cards face up on the table for your customers, they can align to it because it's probably how their companies are run as well. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. So for this one specifically, what are they asking to do? If your payment terms are net 30 and they're asking for net 60, well, that tells you that they wanna pay more slowly. That's lever number two, the timing of cash. And so, for you to be able to walk back through, hey, our pricing model is based on how much you buy, how fast you pay, how long you commit, and that mutual alignment around when you sign, what you're asking for is to pay a little bit more slowly. Our pricing is based on net 30. If you want net 60, you can have it, but we need to adjust one of these other levers to make up for it. Commit to more volume, commit a little longer, help us forecast or maybe it cost you a couple extra bucks to do it, but it's got to be based on something and your four levers is not only a place to start but also should be the place to end too. Mistake number four that I see all the time and as I'm teaching this comes up so often, makes me wanna cry myself to sleep. And it's this idea of, hey, Todd. We wanna add a fifth lever, and that fifth lever is case studies. Right? That, hey, when we get into a discount situation that we want the customer to be able to do a case study for us following the sale and that we're willing to pay for that in the form of a discount. I would argue that's not a good idea. And so, alright, tell me if I'm crazy here, but I want you to imagine that you are having a a large home renovation done. Right? You're gonna have your kitchen remodeled, and you're looking at contractors. And you find a couple of contractors, you go read the case studies and testimonials on their website, and they're glowing for one of them. Right? Wow. This is this one's a good one. You know what? We're gonna spend our money and our time. We're gonna be out of our kitchen for a while. This one is fantastic. And they send over the DocuSign or whatever, and just as you're about to sign it, you find out that all those case studies on their website, they were paid for. Would that make you more confident in this contractor or the opposite, less? Now while this might sound like a stretch at a subconscious level, it probably isn't, is aren't you signaling to the buyer at the goal line, that buyer that probably made a decision to go with you based on your case studies and references and marketing and all of that, that maybe you actually paid them to be case studies for you by telling the customer, hey. Right at the goal line, you want that discount? We are going to require that you give us a case study six months, twelve months, however long in. You are telling the customer the same thing that, hey. Because we're willing to pay you for that case study, we're actually paying all of our other customers who did case studies that probably influenced your decision along the way as well. My bottom line on this is that you earn case studies. You don't pay for them. Putting that language in the contract has no teeth anyway. Why would you pay for it? What I mean by that is if you've assigned that customer and require them to do a case study contractually and you suck, are you gonna take them to court? Listen, we paid for this. You didn't give us a case study. Like, of course not. That would be ridiculous. Now on the other hand, let's say it's not in there and you've created a great outcome and a great experience for your customer, and then you go ask them. Hey. Listen. There's tremendous value as we continue to build the organization that supports you. You want us to be around for a long time. We'd love to get your input and get a case study built with you that's gonna make you look like a star too because, by the way, in your case studies, they better make the customer the hero, not you. Alright? Just a side note, all of these case studies talk, oh, how great we are. If you change the lens of those to, hey. Look at what this customer did, how awesome a job they did, and they just so happen to be using us, You're gonna get a lot more yeses to those case studies, and your case studies are gonna resonate more with your future customers that wanna be heroes just like that person. So stop paying for it, earn it, and when you do, you're gonna find that those customers, they're gonna love to do it for you if you frame it in the right way. Alright. Negotiation mistake number five is this idea of creating certainty when a customer asks if you'll hold the price to next month. Here's a little story for you. So way back when, we were negotiating a large deal with a client. And as a part of this negotiation, we had explained to them that there's tremendous value in our ability to predict our business. And if they were willing to mutually mutually align around the timing of when they can get that done, that was something we were willing to pay them for in the form of a discount, and we did. We had mutually aligned around the September. It was a part of the commercial terms negotiation that we had done. Now what happened? Well, we got to around September 23 and suddenly my rep gets a call. Hey, I no no way of knowing this was gonna be the case, but this has gone through the entire approval chain. The CFO is the signer and they're on vacation. They're on vacation through the end of the month, so they won't be back until the October. Will you hold the price? Well, the mistake that I see made all the time is for us to create certainty around that ask. What do I mean by that? Well, so often, we will defiantly say no. Hey. Listen. We had an agreement. That price goes away at midnight on September 30. Right? What have we done in that case? Well, we've probably eroded a little trust, but what we've also done is we've probably ironically slowed down the deal, meaning that if they're not able to get it done and October comes around and they now have to go get new POs and new approvals because the price just went up 10%, whatever you were paying them for to help you forecast, well, that means your October deal just became the October, the November, or maybe never. Or the mistake that I see made all the time is that we say, yeah, it'll be fine. As long as it's Monday morning, just get it done or cool, well, your deal just slipped to the October. My recommendation here is to create uncertainty around the ask, and this isn't a game or some kind of trick. It should be the truth to simply say three words. I don't know. That remember, our pricing was based on these four things, how much you buy, how fast you pay, how long you commit, and that mutual alignment around timing, and let's talk about next month, next month. In this case, my rep did a masterful job of explaining that to the customer. Hey. We had no idea the CFO was gonna be gone, but they'll be back on October 1. Can you hold the price? He said, hey. I don't know. Right? Let's talk about next month, next month. What I do know is that our pricing, the pricing that you've got be before you is based on those four things, one of which being our mutual alignment. We're paying you in the form of a discount to help us with our forecast. That remains the same through the September. If October comes and you haven't gotten it signed, let's just talk about it then. Guess what? Well, after they hung up, my phone rang and it was that customer asking me the same question. And what was my answer? I don't know. It's the exact same answer. Right? Hey, listen. We are paying you in the form of a discount to help us with our forecast, and we're giving you money. We're giving you something. What we're getting in return is forecast accuracy. Remember? Yeah? Okay. Cool. So do all you can to try to get that thing done, and we'll talk about October and October. Miraculously, they found somebody else to sign it, like September 26, and another winner there. Right? Today's show was brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Now it always doesn't happen. Right? It's not a 100% foolproof approach. You've gotta think about if they still aren't able to get it signed when October 1 comes around, you've got to take a look on a case by case basis. I would recommend that you look at it and say, is there still value in us taking this off the table? Many cases, there is. Explain that to the customers. Always gotta be a why. Like, hey, listen. I know we missed that, but there's value in our ability to get this thing done right now before our board meeting. So let's sign it. Cool. Or if it's a customer that's messed with you over and over again, maybe you wanna go back to the drawing board and explain it to them. Hey. Listen. We had mutually aligned around that timing. We're paying you for something we didn't get. We're gonna have to take a fresh look at this. So let's do that in October. Those are your paths. But again, that certainty is going to draw people to the answer. Uncertainty draws us to create certainty. And when you've created certainty around getting it done that month, I'm telling you more often than not, your customers are still gonna figure out a way to get it done. Negotiation mistake number six, I see all the time, is the talk about value myth. And here's what I mean. We get to the goal line of a deal and the negotiation has begun, and the customer comes to you and says, hey, we need a 30% discount. We need a 40% discount, whatever it is, in order to get this thing done. And our initial inclination is to go talk about the value. Like, we believe that our solution is worth x. Stop it. Right? That ship left the station long before that negotiation happened. If the customer is not seeing the value at that point, you telling them that right at the goal line is not helping. There's an amazing quote from a neuroscientist named Antonio Damasio. He talked about in his book, Descartes' Error, back in the late nineteen nineties. But the quote is this, We are not thinking machines that feel. We are feeling machines that think. We, as human beings, do not make logical decisions and back them up with feelings. We do the opposite. And so often in this case, we tend to think that our logic is going to out overpower their feeling, and that is not the case. If, a, we have done a good job setting pricing expectations upfront around what that price is and what it's based on, back to the four levers. Your pricing is based on how much you buy, how fast you pay, how long you commit, and when you sign, then you can continually go back to that when the customer is asking for a discount To be able to say, hey, do you need 30% off? Cool. Be a human being. Ask them about where it's coming from, but then remind them that their pricing is based on these four things, and maybe there's an opportunity to go through those and see those are the four things that we are willing to pay you for in the form of a discount. Let's see which ones and things you're willing to do to move those levers back and forth to get you a little bit closer. But stop making the value argument at the goal line because that has never helped anybody in the history of sales to make a value argument right at the goal line to try to justify your price. If you haven't done it at the beginning, it's certainly not gonna work at the end. And negotiation mistake number seven is this idea that we need to anchor high, whether it's on the price or any other kinds of terms. So we've got room to come down later. Stop it. I literally was going out it was in Denver, Colorado. I was going out to teach an organization, four levers negotiating. And before we started, the CRO approached me very proudly to tell me that, hey, listen. We just added a stipulation in compensation plans that if a rep is able to sell a deal above list price, they are gonna get an extra point on their commissions, I almost completely burst into tears, went running through the let me out of here. Right? That's the worst advice I've ever heard in the history of humankind, and here's why. In this world today, where the proliferation of information means that your customers have access to talk to one another every single day, and we've got AI exposing our pricing models anyway, we can no longer have every single customer paying a different amount based on how well or poorly the negotiation went. Can you imagine being that customer finding out a couple of months later that they paid over list price because of some gimmick or trick the sales rep did? You might think, yay. I got that deal. Good for me. I hit my quarter. I'm telling you that when we do these types of things, you're going to find that while you got that deal, it will cost you four, five, ten, twenty deals that you never knew even existed because your trust and reputation in the market will go in the garbage right away. Takes me back to my favorite sales quote of all time. It's from a guy named Arthur Dunn in his 1921 book, Scientific Selling and Advertising. As you go through the book, it reads like a normal book. Man, there's words on pages, and you flip the page. There's only one sentence at the top of this page and here's the quote. If the truth won't sell it, don't sell it. My advice for you is you establish your pricing on a sound firm basis based on those four levers, volume, timing of cash, length of commitment, timing of the deal. That is the price. The price is the price and the flexibility is within those levers consistently. So every single one of your customers might be paying a different amount, but you're getting value in other ways from them. So in perpetuity, you've got every single customer kinda paying the same amount with the flexibility within those. One last story there. One of my massive clients, multibillion dollar company, as we were getting ready to finish and sign the deal for me to do workshops for them, they added a paragraph to their language, and that paragraph is called most favored nation pricing. And, basically, what that means is that I need to to sign off that this client was paying the same or less than every other one of my customers, and they reserved the right to audit that. They were blown away when they delivered this thing, and they're like, hey. This paragraph's in there. And I was like, cool. I'm good. I signed it right away. And everybody was like, what are you, bananas? No. Because I know that my price is my price consistently across all of my customers with the flexibility within those something that matters to me, whether it be volume, timing of cash, length of commitment, or that predictability that comes with the timing of the deal. So stop anchoring high. The long game wins the long game, but it also wins the short game too when you're doing things through transparently, honestly, and always telling the truth. Your pricing should be no exception to that rule. So those are the seven deadly negotiation sins or mistakes that I see happening all the time and easy potential solutions to each one of those. We've touched on some of the four levers as we've gone through this little program today, but I dive very deep into it. In my new book, Four Levers Negotiation, that is coming out soon. Pre order is available everywhere you get your books in really any format as well. So if you've enjoyed what you've heard today, we are doing a full four levers negotiation master class. It's gonna be out in a couple of weeks. You can sign up to be notified just down below.
