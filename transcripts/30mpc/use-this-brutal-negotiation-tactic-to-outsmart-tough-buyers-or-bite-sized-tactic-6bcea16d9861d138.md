## Transcript

So one of my reps was on this deal, and he kept submitting it back to me for approval. Yeah. And, like, every time he would submit it to me, it was a smaller deal size. And I was like, what the hell is going on with him? It's like, every time I get on a call with this guy, he asked me for, like, 5 k more. And so it goes from, like, 50 to 45 to 40 to 35 to 32. And I'm like, dude. Like, we can't go below 30 k. Like, you are at bare bottom. Like, it has to be enough. He's like, can you help me out? Can you jump on this call with me? And so I jump on the call. I'm like, hey, Ed. It's nice to meet you. And he's like, look, Arman. I really like your product, but your competitors are at 20. I'm like, great. What do they do differently? He's like, well, you guys have this. I'm like, great. So the value is 30. He's like, look. The reality is, like, I have a budget, and I can only pay 20. I'm like, Ed, the reality is we've given you 20 k. You are aware that this contract expires at the end of the month. The end of the month is seven days. We want your business, but at the same time, you have to make a decision. He goes, nope. I'm gonna think about it. I say, great, Ed. Your contract does expire at the end of the month. I'm gonna move this to a touch point tomorrow, same time. Goodbye. We hop on the next call tomorrow. Guess what? Ed shows up. He's like, yep. You know, I was thinking about this more. Really, the only amount that I can pay today is $22. He's like, can you do that? I'm like, Ed, I really appreciate you as a customer. I want your business, but the lowest we can do is $30. He says, nope. Gotta think about it. I'm like, Ed, I hope you know that your contract is expiring at the end of the month. I have to move this meeting again to the same time tomorrow, and I will see you there. Great. We jump in this rigmarole. Yeah. Four times in a five day work week, I meet with Ed Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and then it gets to Friday. Mhmm. And the end of the month is the weekend. Yep. And I'm like, Ed, I'm like you. I want a deal on everything, but I need you to know this is the best deal that I've approved all month, and I need a decision right now. Otherwise, I have to close this contract at the end of the day. And lo and behold, Ed said, tip of the hat to you. I wish my sales reps did this too, and Ed signed the contract at fullest. So a lot of the times, the battle in negotiation is where reps get themselves into trouble is when they give a discount, they don't get time line in return. Mhmm. But the one thing my rep did right is he gave a discount with a contingency to expire at the end of the month. Yeah. And once we hit rock bottom, I knew that Ed had to make a decision Yeah. At the end of the week. And so the battle in these negotiations is it's like a battle of that internal fortitude is it gets to day 23, day 24. It gets to day 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and you're nervous because the thirtieth of the month is approaching, and you have to stay firm if you have set the because they know exactly what they're doing. No one gets paid to sign early in a negotiation. A savvy negotiator will always sign at the latest day possible. But if you set that exploding deadline, you can hold them to it. Yeah. I think the thing that you did really well in that story is, like, every single call you had, you reminded the buyer. It's not it's it's one thing to say, hey. This expires at the end of the month. It's another to reinforce it again and again and again, and you're gonna feel sort of like a broken record where it's like, I've already told them. Do I need to say it again? But by bringing it up on every single call that, hey. You've got a deal, but it's going to go away here, It becomes real for them. And you're totally right about the savvy buyer thing. It's actually funny. My wife is about to become an Equinox member, and I'm the one who's negotiating the deal. And I'm like, Emma, it's June today. And I'm like, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to stick with LA Fitness for a couple more days. I'm waiting until the very end of the month because I know that's how we get the extra guest passes. That's how we get the store credit. Like, we're literally gonna wait till the end of the month because I know the rep there is gonna start to sweat. So, yeah, we'll see if I win that one or not. That's another good example of that jar analogy where you're gonna slice up that Equinox rep one ask at a time. Mhmm. The first thing is you get the ping pong balls in the jar, and it's like, that's the price. The second thing is if they can't discount the membership anymore, you start pouring sand in the jar in between the cracks, that's when you start asking for store credit. Mhmm. It's like, okay. They're out of store credit. You got a $200 membership at Equinox. You got $500 in store credit. It's like, now I need 20 guest passes. Yeah. And that's the water that goes in the jar. Right? Just slice them apart in negotiation one step at a time. Yeah. That's how you get the best deal. Yeah. 100%.
