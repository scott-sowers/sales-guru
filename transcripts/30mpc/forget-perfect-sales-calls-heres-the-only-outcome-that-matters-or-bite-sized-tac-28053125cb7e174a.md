## Transcript

I am not one of these sales leaders that lives and dies on, you've gotta ask the best questions in the world. I'm a simple sales guy. Right? And so when I think about, and, Mark, actually, you got this from you back in the day. Right? Was what's the win coming off the call? What's a w? Right? What do what do we get a high five about if this goes well on the call? Right? And I I I love that frame because we establish our exit criteria. And let's just say for this argument that, like, our exit criteria is only just do you find a problem that we can solve? Like, that's it. That's the only thing we're going for. We're gonna give tactics. Here's the types of questions. Hey. What's the o in your OKRs? Right? What's keeping you up at night? What's on your whiteboard, right now? What are you and your boss talk about often? What have you identified in your process? What's red on your, on your dashboard right now? There's a bunch of different ways to ask the problem question to sort of get to the meat of it. Right? But what I always tell the reps is I don't care how you get there, just that you get there. Right? And the example I use is, like, look, you know, baseball. Right? Does it matter if you win the game nine to one or two to one? Doesn't matter. Right? So if you ask the the world's best discovery questions, if you have the best discovery call, it's a 10 out of 10. We all agree that this is the best discovery call we've ever heard. You just did an awesome job getting to what's the problem we're solving. Now you can have the worst discovery call. It can be clunky. You could trip over your words. You're umming and aahing all over the place. It's not even coherent. But if after the end of that forty five minute or sixty minute discovery call, if you got that one problem that we can solve and they agreed to continue to explore that problem, that's a win. And that's how we gotta teach our reps. Right? Is, it's more about the meat and the outcome than it is always about, like, the finesse of how you get there. It's not so much about how you do it. It's about what you end up with. And so as you're if you're a sales leader and you're thinking about process and how much how prescriptive am I in telling people how to do something, you need to look at where you're at on that transactional to enterprise and sale. The more transactional, the more micromanaged you can make your sales process. The more enterprise, the more it's big picture, and, like, this is what we're trying to accomplish in the buyer's mind before we move on. How you do that is kind of up to you. What is the big w? Pick another stage, whether it's demo, technical validation, scoping, proposal. What is the big w that you give your reps guidance on getting? And then what are, like, two or three tools that you give them to get the big w? My mind goes right to the next call, which is, you know or the next stage is just gonna be demoing the the technology. In this stage, you have a suspicion that you can help. Right? We we've been able to narrow our, our conversation to a problem or set of problems that we've, we've uncovered in that first stage, and now we have a suspicion that we could potentially solve that through our technology. Right? And I think that the mistake that a lot of sellers make is they try to show everything. Right? All the capabilities, all the features, all the bells and whistles, like, the whole deal. And then everyone's confused after. Right? So a tactic that that I like to see is and let's just say we're solving three problems. That's what we've agreed on. Like, these are the three things we can solve. Right? And so for Conner Room, you know, we're we're effectively solving, you know, pipeline and, like, deal acceleration. This is the is the space that we play in. Right? And I was on discovery call on Friday. His big issue with this, Ignativirus' big issue was that, hey. I'm doing great in two of my three segments, but my commercial segment is a thousand to 2,000. We're really struggling generating pipeline. So first, that's the topic of the demo. This demo is about how we're gonna help you solve, you know, the generating pipeline within this a thousand to 2,000 employee band. Full stop. Headline. Right? Here are the three things we're gonna show you. So then we set the frame for them. Like, hey. There's three things we're gonna show you that lead to this. And then when we go to show those three things, so it's headline. It's, you know, what we're gonna go show you. And then we actually go to show you it's we're gonna show you one thing, and then it's gonna be, Mark, I just showed you this thing. Do you agree that this solves your problem? Yes or no? And if it's a yes, awesome. We're gonna move on to the next thing. If it's a no or if it's a maybe, well, maybe we didn't articulate it well enough. Maybe we moved too fast. Maybe we didn't ask the right questions. Something. Right? So those are the tactics that I would take, the reps through, in the demo phase. And then, again, the the end goal or the w coming out of that phase is, did we show you that we can solve your problem? Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out.
