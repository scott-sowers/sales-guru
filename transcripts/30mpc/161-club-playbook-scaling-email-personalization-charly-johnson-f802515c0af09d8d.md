## Transcript

Welcome to this club playbook of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Charley Johnson, and today, we are gonna talk about one of my favorite topics, which is how to scale personalized emails. So I'm gonna just cover a quick three step by step agenda of exactly what we're gonna cover today. So section one, we're gonna talk a bit more about research and how this is gonna help us scale personalized emails, especially in those later stages of the cadence. Section two, we're gonna talk a bit about trigger templates, how to find them, and how to create trigger templates. And finally, section three, we're gonna talk about deposit templates. Again, how to find them and how we can create these deposit templates. I'm excited, and I hope you are too. So three, two, one. Let's go. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. So what's crazy is the fact that in today's digital environment, we not only need to be way more personalized than ever before, but we also need to be way more consistent with our outreach than ever before. And sales engagement tools make that second bit really, really easy, but often what ends up being compromised is the relevance and the personalization of the message, especially at those later stages of your outreach. Because let's face it, personalization on step one is pretty, pretty easy. But once you get to later on at step 15, it starts to make those pitchy templates and generic persona templates more and more tempting to use. And in today's market, pitching about what you do in generic persona templates just isn't enough to get a reply. And in my opinion, just doesn't tick or count for being consistent. So I'm gonna share three easy ways to help personalize those later stages of your cadence with minimal effort, and I'll be sharing some simple structures you can put into practice today. So section one, I'm gonna talk a bit about researching. And in order to achieve personalization in the later stages, you need to have good research. Research that is easy to digest and accessible. And if you're using a sales engagement tool, it's really easy for you because you can just pin that research to the top of your prospects page. So in this research section, yes, we're gonna write information that we found out about our prospects and that we're gonna use to personalize. So things like hiring SDRs, selling into enterprise, expanding into The US, etcetera, but we're not just going to stop there. You are going to take this research and specifically write down which templates you'll be using from your research in the later stages of your cadence. So as an example, I will have a section in my research notes that is labeled templates, and I will use this section to remind future me exactly what to be adding in later on. So under templates, it might say insert hiring SDL template or insert hiring AE template as an example. And this research step, although it sounds really, really obvious and maybe a little bit boring, is actually key to helping personalize those latest steps of your cadence. So to summarize, make sure your research notes are really, really clear and concise, and you have a section that's prompting future you exactly which templates to be uncertain in the later stages of your cadence to help you save time. So for section two and three, I'm gonna talk about trigger templates and deposit templates. And, sadly, this gets me really excited. So let's talk about section two first and start with trigger templates. A trigger template is simply taking persona based templates to that next level. Because as mentioned earlier, generic persona based templates are no longer enough to get a reply. Every single prospect knows that dynamic tags exist and saying that I see you are the title at company x is clearly automated. So triggers are specific enough that they can only be for that one individual, but they're generic enough that you can send them to a lot of people. And to find these triggers, all you need to do, you and your team, the common personalization topics that you use when you're doing your outreach. So it could be the fact that they're hiring for an SDR or an AE role. Maybe they're expanding into a new geography or they sell into a difficult market or persona. These are examples for me selling to salespeople, but can you see how these trigger examples can be created into scalable templates? And they are what I recommend definitely using in those later stages of your cadence and sequence when you probably have a little less time to be personalizing. So now we know our triggers. How can we use these to create a really easy structure for our trigger templates? So before I share the structure, you don't need to do this solo. Like, do it as a team to help you save time and to get better at those email structures as well. So an example trigger structure is, to be honest, pretty similar to a normal personalized email. Section one is gonna be personalization, then we're gonna go through our challenges, then we're gonna go to our call to action, and you can add a PS at the end if you would like to. So for the personalization, this is where you're gonna have your trigger. The challenge and the call to action should be something that you already have within your templates as well. So an example for that trigger personalization could sound something like reading the SDR role you're hiring for, first name. Would I be completely wrong in assuming you're focused on outbound pipeline? So that's an example of the trigger personalization. And can you see how that can literally be sent to any single person hiring SDRs, but it's specific enough that it sounds like a one to one personalized email. Now for the challenge, it might sound something like 60% of companies are missing their targets right now, and the number one influencer is not booking enough outbound meetings. The main challenge causing this is the lack of visibility into their team's outreach, which makes defining a scalable process tough. Challenge done. Now for the call to action. Wondering if this is something on your brain at the moment with the growing team, and then your optional PS. PS, best of luck with the hiring. Sounds like a really exciting time at company. So that's a really easy structure that you can be using. And, again, the structure is trigger personalization followed by the challenges, then followed by the call to action. And why this works so well is the fact that hiring SDRs is specific enough as a topic to be a trigger, but literally the number of people I can send this to is a lot. And as a tip, if you're struggling with that challenge part of your email, as this is something I definitely struggled with at my previous companies, you can use internal case studies. You can speak to your ICP persona both internally or even externally. And my final tip to understand the challenges, for your persona is to use chat g p two and say something like, pretend I'm a CMO. Tell me the top three focuses and challenges in 2023, and then relate these to what you solve. So to summarize section two for our trigger templates, to find your triggers, simply note down the common personalization topics you're using with the in your outreach. And, again, they need to be niche enough that it looks like a one to one email, but generic enough that you can send this to multiple people. And finally, for section three, we're gonna talk about deposit templates because it's great highlighting the challenges to our prospects, but we don't need to bombard them with every single outreach step being about the challenges as it can probably get a bit too much for them. So deposit templates are templates where you can tick that personalization and consistency box while still adding value. And all a deposit is is simply sharing something they might find useful. We're not asking for time. We're simply gonna be providing value. And for this, I recommend not using internal resources. Use external resources like articles, podcasts, webinars, LinkedIn posts because it helps build more credibility. And similarly to the tips about understanding your challenges, if you don't know useful content that your per persona likes to engage with, then you can simply ask both internally and externally your persona, but you can also use Google to find this out too. But for an external person, you can simply add them on LinkedIn and say something like, hey. Not trying to pitch you, but I'm hoping you can help me out. I'm looking to find resources my persona, aka you, like to engage with. So wondering if you have any go to webinars, articles, etcetera that you like to engage with. Appreciate any help. This will make the deposit information you send really, really topical and relevant. And now you know the deposit information to send, what can these templates look like? So for a deposit template structure, it's gonna be a lot shorter and more concise than a personalized email. And the structure is gonna start with your trigger personalization, and then secondly, you're gonna insert your deposit. So it might sound something like with the growing SDR team, which is ticking that trigger personalization, thought they might find this webinar, thirty minutes to president's club, did useful. It shares a really easy email structure that gets replies. Deposit done. Hope it helps. No call to action. And that's it. Simple. Right? So to summarize, deposit templates are great for adding value in those later stages of your cadence while maintaining that personalization and relevancy. And to find these useful deposits, simply ask your persona what they like to engage with. And these trigger and deposit templates can be used both on email or also LinkedIn. I probably send about two trigger templates and maybe two to three deposit templates throughout my cadence. All are personalized and relevant, so increase your chances of getting a reply and require minimal time. So a quick recap of what we've covered today. Section one, key takeaway. Have a structure so your research is clear and helps prompt future you exactly which templates to be in the later stages of your cadence. Section two key takeaway, save time and maintain personalization in the latest stages by creating these really great trigger templates. And finally, section three key takeaway, create deposit templates to, again, maintain consistency and help add value and credibility. And finally, watch how these really simple tips and templates help increase your replies.
