## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigalski. And, folks, we have the number one seller who I've ever coached in my entire career. Her name is Morgan Mello. In 2021, she closed 750 k as a mid market AE in a single quarter, and she had done something pretty damn close to that in the few quarters prior to that. As a reference point, her quota that year was a billion dollars, so she closed 75% of her number in a single quarter. And then moving forward, she continued to close multiple Fortune one hundred logos. I will not share all of the names, but you've probably ordered food from them to your house. You've probably taken one of their cars. You've probably used one of their laptops or opened up their apps on your phone. And so, Nick, why should people listen? This was an episode where we got into a lot of contrarian viewpoints that Morgan has around selling to the enterprise. We talked about showing a demo before you do any discovery. So literally flipping the order of the calls and using the, what she calls, Vibe demo as a way to inform what you ask them in your discovery call, which is call number two. We also got into some of those contrarian things around, like, where and when and how early Morgan will share price, hard dequeuing enterprise deals if you smell that they're not a fit. And, honestly, this is one where Morgan's got a lot of EQ when it comes to selling. And so if you've ever felt like, this doesn't totally feel right, whatever my manager is telling me to do or what I've been told I need to do in sales. And so this is one that will change a lot of your beliefs. I know it changed a lot of mine around what good selling actually looks like. Alright, Morgan. Welcome back to the show. You might remember that we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get yours. Alright. Tip number one, sell differently to early adopters and late product adopters. Typically, early adopters, you can vision sell, excite the hell out of those folks, and they're gonna be early adopters ready to jump in with you. In my experience, when you get to some of the more laggards in the market, you almost have to scare them into why they cannot keep operating status quo. If they were thrilled on some of these novel ideas, they would have joined your tool by now, most likely. So they need to be pushed a little bit more. For me, what that's looked like with some of our market data, for example, is with the early adopters, I could say, hey. This has been so broken. The data's stale. Don't you hate that? And they were like, yes. I'm so ready. Let me jump in. When I got to the later folks in the market, I actually had to be a little more aggressive and say things like you are going to be at a competitive disadvantage if you don't use this data at this point. And then it started to open their eyes a bit. Really nice. What's number two? Number two, collaborate on a project plan with your champion and early. In my experience, probably one of the best ways to health check your deal is to collaborate on a project plan with your champion. It is a lot of work to bring on a vendor. If you haven't done it before, maybe try to do it internally so so you get a taste for it. But if you're offering to do a lot of their work for them to help bring you on and they're pushing back on that a little bit, that's probably a big red flag that that's not where you should be spending your time. Doing this with them also gives you a very non cringe way to start to put timelines and milestones in the ground, which will just generally help you with your deal, reporting, fact to leadership, all of the above. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone.

Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers. And we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Cool. Write us out, Morgan. What's number three? Okay. Number three. We have this thing at Pave called the Vibey demo. What to think about here is probably pretty controversial, but we'll get into it. Contrary to probably belief, you can do demo before you do disco, especially with impatient buyers or people in enterprise that have seen these types of tools a thousand times. Sometimes you just gotta show them before you can start asking them the why behind stuff. Maybe they just wanna let their be and see the product, Or we also have this phrase here at Pave called everyone wants full suite. They just might not know it yet. And so if you start to show them some of the other tools that you have, it may actually get them interested in more things than they had originally come to you for. Alrighty, Morgan. So I wanna dig in on this Vibey demo. Could you give an example of a time that you decided to do the Vibey demo instead of jump into traditional discovery? And I'm curious, like, why you decided to do that instead of a normal disco call. I would say it happens often, and I think a lot of us have seen this. Like, when people put a demo request in the website, it's because they wanna see a demo, not because they wanna tell you about their problems. But sometimes I've had folks email me and say, hey. For our demo and they add, by the way, they add, like, seven people or something obnoxious. And they say, these are the things that I wanna see. And so I'm like, great. No problem. If you wanna see those things, I'm so stoked to show you. Clearly, you care enough that you're gonna take seven other people's time for the demo. One thing I do do before that Vibey demo, which is essentially a window shop around all of our tools, is I'll send a demo checklist. One thing that I've seen more junior reps get stuck on in their version of discovery is how often do you run merit cycles? What tools do you use? Who's involved? Which compensation types are they? Those are not real discovery questions. Those are just questions that you need to know on how you're gonna configure the tool or run the demo. I say great. Happy to jump into a demo. I have a couple of questions I can send over async or we can bang through them in a ten minute meeting, just you and I, ahead of time just so that we can tailor that demo to you. And I actually have, like, a Google form, if you will, that I will send to a prospect, which by the way is super helpful resource, especially when you get to post sales just to send along that has all of those basic details that, again, junior reps get hung up on, but it also just drains time for your actual discovery time. So I'll send that, jump into the demo, then I can tailor the demo, but show them around. They get excited about things. And then once they're leaned in because it's a good looking tool, it's a good product, then on the next call, I'm like, hey. This was something that was really interesting to you. Why? And once you've kind of gotten them excited and leaned in, they're much more open to those real discovery questions. I know that the pre demo checklist questions are gonna be different for every company. Could you share the questions that you have on yours? Because I think it will help give people a sense of, like, the types of questions they could use and adapt for their own product that they sell. I think, like, the things that you should be thinking about are if you have a tool that's configurable, what different types of configurations do you have, and that's something to ask. But demos really need to feel real to who you're talking to. So even just the little details of like, for us, we integrate with our underlying HRIS and equity system. Instead of saying, we'll pull your HRIS data in here, I'm gonna say all those fields that you have in Workday today that are relevant for planning, those are gonna get pulled in. They can start to visualize themselves using the tool a lot more. So those are the things I would be thinking about or, like, what are the little things that you can do to make it feel more real based on their current setup? So how do you actually run that demo then? So you have this checklist of the systems they're on, how they're doing things today. What does that flow actually look like? The nice thing is it's mostly the same flow every time. So prepping for these calls with your essay gets really efficient. We literally just have this one's a VIBE demo. Sounds good. But, basically, usually, what that looks like for us is that we'll open up we'll do intros agenda, kind of the typical stuff, and then I will do an overview of Pave just to set the scene. For us, it's often a trap that we get a prospect that is really familiar with Pave, and they almost never actually are. They know that we have a market data tool. They know that we have a total rewards tool. They don't know that we do everything. So I'll just reorient. This is what you should know about us as a business. We're best in breed compensation end to end. We're a complete platform. These are the types of companies that we service. They're the most innovative companies in the space. This is what it means to you. We care a lot about design. We are constantly pushing the product. We're also not an early stage start up that is just now figuring this out and gonna promise you the world. We're kind of that Goldilocks in between feature complete Workday and series a start up. And then once I've kinda set the stage on us as a business, I talk about our products. So I'll show, like, a one slider that's like, look. I'm not gonna spend much time in slides, but we do do a lot of things being end to end. We have market data. We have planning tools. Once you have that data, you need to build ranges. You need to run a cycle. Then you need to communicate to employees. These are the things that we can go through today. Typically, we go through them chronologically like this. Is there anything you wanna change on that script as we actually jump into the tool and show you a couple things to see what's interesting? Usually, the answer is no. If people are like, that's chronological. Or sometimes the answer is, actually, planning is a huge pain for us right now, and I had no idea that you guys do total reward statements. Can we focus most of the time there? And then I say, okay, Mike. Over to you. Like, let's jump in here and then go there. And it feels organic, but in reality, we've done it a thousand times. So, Morgan, I wanna pause. And, normally, we would just keep going into, like, the how to do this thing, but I know there are probably a million sales leaders, managers, and people who've been taught you have to do discovery before you do demo. And this is a clear departure from that. And you've closed logos that literally every single person listening to this podcast knows about. Like, this is not transactional sales. These are, like, $6.07 figure TCV deals. Could you really walk me through, like, if I'm a seller and I've normally been taught to do discovery, why should I start with an overview like this? Why should I walk them through all my products first instead of figuring out which of those products they really have a problem with and only show them that. Couple reasons why you might wanna do it. For me, one of the main reasons I do it is enterprise sales tends to be pretty myopic. You're who you're talking to, they might be trying to solve one very specific problem. Their boss might be trying to solve six problems, and sometimes you need to help them connect those dots. That's one reason that I would do it is just to kinda show off everything. And, again, coming back to that phrase, like, everybody wants full suite. They just don't know it yet. And so showing them that that stuff can help get them leaned in. Another reason might be you get much more impatient buyers oftentimes that just wanna be able to fill out their RFP doc, figure out if you're a good company to push through their buying process or not. And if you start burning time and goodwill on discovery, it can feel really annoying. Like, we've all been in those situations where you're, like, walking through the mall and somebody starts asking you questions like, do you want a sample? And you're like, no. Please, for the love of God, I don't want a sample. Like, I I don't wanna get stuck in a room with you having to talk about whatever skin care or something. And so instead, you can basically address it head on. They're looking for what products do you have, what is the timeline, what is the price. But sometimes you just need to, like, be a good buying partner for them. And then once you've gotten some of that trust with the buyer, then you can start to unwind. Like, why is that a problem? And it doesn't feel awkward and cold anymore. Now you've established the criteria that you're on the same page, and then you can actually get into the details. I wanna hear from you. What you said is, like, you're going through this Vybe demo. It's really designed to, like, show them the art of the possible, all the things you could impact for them as a way to, like, earn more time, get some credibility, and help inform future discovery. And then you mentioned you were even saying this in the pre call. You have to be extremely disciplined in call number two to go back to discovery. Let's say you get to the end of this meeting, and you can tell they're vibing with your Vibe. What do you set as the next step, and how do you position that next step to the buyer knowing that you're gonna do that disciplined discovery then? When it comes to next steps, I like to set next next steps. When I get to the end of that call and I say, hey. Just to recap, so we went through, we looked at planning, we looked at employee comms, we looked at always on views, we looked at some of the back end, like, nitty gritty compensation stuff that really only matters for this team, not necessarily a lot of the folks that aren't in this room. From here, usually what I see is let's do a broader demo on planning with a couple of those execs that whatever, like, is relevant. A normal next step might be another demo, which is fine. And then usually after that, what we'll do is maybe, Arman, just you and me can meet kinda talk through some of the specifics. It sounds like you guys I I meant I heard you mentioned requirements notes. It sounds like you might actually have a document that you're working off of. If you could share that with me, fantastic. Then we can start to annotate it just so that we don't have to spend a ton of time in the weeds, and you can start to check off some of the things that Pave can do. So you set those next next steps, and it sounds like now you're gonna drill into, like, deeper demos on certain products that resonated. So you jump onto a call and you're like, okay. This is maybe a sixty minute call for the planning product. My guess is you don't just jump into another sixty minute demo. You talked about being disciplined and coming back to discovery. What does that look like on that second call? I might say, hey. On the first call, I know planning was exciting to you guys. You've been using a tool to date. You've just been using your HCM bolt on. Usually, the reason why you might be looking to replace it is because you're not actually using that tool. All of your execs are just dumping everything into spreadsheets anyway, and you're losing all of that audit history and all of the perks of having software in the first place. Or maybe your r and d org just does something completely bespoke that the tool can't handle, and so they're running completely amok. Or maybe it's just, like, some of the analytics that you're completely missing and so you're having to go back at the end. Like, what is it that made you so excited about our planning tool? Is it one of those? Is it something else? And 90% of the time, they're like, oh, it's all of those things and because they've already seen it, they know what you can do, you just told them that you know why this is a problem and why people usually buy it. You're gonna get, like, a 10 times more comprehensive answer than if I got on a thirty minute disco, and I was like, so comp planning, tell me about it. You just you get you're gonna get much deeper. What the demo does to make this real with a Pave example, it gives your prospect a bunch of things to hook onto. Because oftentimes in discovery, it's just as open ended thing where it's like, I'm gonna ask you these questions and, like, sort of abstract path and hope that I can land you on the right problems versus a prospect can now be like, oh my god. I loved it when you could automate the compensation recommendations. Mhmm. And behind that hook is a problem. Instead of, like, trying to, like, Miyagi your way around it in a discovery call, if a prospect's like, oh, I love the automated comp recommendations, you can just say, like, great. Typically, when people really like the automated comp recommendations, it's because people are going, like, completely hog wild with their comp increases or it's something else like this. I'm curious which one of those is that. And so it actually gets you to the problem far more efficiently, and they're far more likely to be less defensive when answering those questions because they know why you're asking that discovery question because product can actually help with it. Yeah. Arman, you talked about this in the context of you call it invert the feature benefit when you're figuring out where to go with your discovery questions, where if you don't know what to ask about related to a feature, you just think about if they don't have this, what would the problem they have be? If you have a single pane of glass reporting suite, you have to think, okay. If somebody doesn't have this, if they don't have clear reporting, well, then I can just flip that on its head. So is, like, reporting really opaque, or do you have trouble seeing this data? And that can help you drive to the pain that they have to inform, again, how you future position that feature. Am I sort of vibing right with how you're doing this, Morgan? You're vibing so right. So, Morgan, one other thing that you were sharing is, like, you were talking about, like, even for some big enterprise deals, you were telling me about sending a $200,000 ARR quote over to somebody over an email right before you went out on mat leave. You were talking about, like, hard dequeuing some of these enterprise deals early. You're doing some things that I think a lot of people would be like, woah. That breaks the traditional sales rules. And so I'm wondering if you can share, like, what are some of the contrarian viewpoints that you have with these enterprise deals that you think actually are leading to some of your success? I think sometimes people white knuckle price in a really weird way. And particularly in enterprise, they have budgets for software spend. Most likely, you're replacing even another tool or, like, they've literally been given the directive, go find a tool to solve this. Here is a budget. Mhmm. Or even, like, the budget might be open. So people could get scared of their own shadow when it comes to price, and I actually think it it hurts you in the long run. I've seen it time and time again. I thought Arman was gonna fire me the day that I sent a $200,000 price over email. And for folks wondering how that shook out, they didn't even ask for discount and signed about a month later. So sometimes they just actually need the price because they need the price to put it into their system to buy the tool. So try not to be too freaked out by that. I still would say it's always best practice to give a price live. I had a call right before we hopped on to record this where they were using a tool that, honestly, I think was $8,000 last time I checked. Dirt cheap. It's basically a spreadsheet. She asked me about price, and I said, yeah. No problem. Like, you know, here's kinda, like, the things to know about our pricing model. I also do try to explain the model first because, like, for us, we're kind of an all in one software fee. We don't nickel and dime. And so at face value, we can feel way more expensive than other options, but we're actually not. So I try to explain that first, and then I give her the numbers. So I basically looked and I said, yeah. Based on the products that we talked about today, your head count, you're not looking at more than probably a 150 k a year. That probably seems wild compared to the tool that you all have been using because I know that one's pretty dirt cheap, but, like, now we're kind of in the realm of real software cost. Is that kinda what you expected, or I just wanna, like, make sure we save everyone's time here. And she was like, yeah. That's kinda what I thought. So it's good to get those things out early. And you can even say things like, I know I'm gonna have to chat with your procurement team, so things might change a little bit. That's normal. But if if I said a 150 and she said, oh, woah. Like, I was thinking 15. Okay. I'm no longer gonna spend any more time. In terms of, like, the next steps, the next next steps, there won't be any because that's just gonna be burning time of me and my SA that we could be spending on deals that are ready to pay. How do you gracefully exit that deal? Someone says, woah. I thought this was gonna be 15. My guess is you ask them a question like, what made you think that? Whatever. Like, if you can tell you need to walk from the deal, what do you actually say in this scenario? You can break up gracefully. It's good for both sides. So, Nick, if your expectation was 15, I'm gonna be super honest with you. Like, Pave's probably not the solution for you. There are other products out there that are really cost effective. Obviously, they don't have a lot of the functionality that we've covered today. But based on the price point that maybe you're comfortable with, you might have to go for a reduced functionality. Let me know if things change. Like, if you as you, you know, chat internally, if there's more appetite to invest in a product, it's gonna be more long term. I will be here for you, but I candidly don't wanna waste your time. We also have a free data product, so I will always forever and ever push people that direction because our freemium model is so successful that usually they end up coming back eventually. I think you can break up with them to benefit both sides because they probably feel super awkward and embarrassed too. So, like, they're also looking for an out. And if they're bluffing and you push them away, you will find out immediately because once you say, okay. Probably not a good fit. Like, come back to me. They'll say, well, actually, maybe if I talk to so and so, I might be able to yeah. There was actually some budget over there, and now you just found out a lot more about the deal. So there's really not, like, a bad outcome, in my opinion, from the soft breakup over price. Eventually, I imagine even with that deal, that's like, yeah. That's what I expected. You have to face up a procurement person, a finance leader, an executive who's like, how the hell do you justify paying a $132,000 more for comp data or a comp workflow tool where our top line in theory is not changing? I'm curious how do you actually go about justifying those massive increases in spend in some of these enterprise deals? I don't usually see that for what it's worth. Most of the time, they're not using a tool that's that cheap because in this particular situation, they weren't using the tool at all. It's pretty simple, in my opinion, to justify that. It's like, for software that's actually usable, it's an investment. It's a cost. From what I can tell, the software that you purchased that was very cheap ended up just being a sunk cost. Two completely different strategies. If you wanna do, you know, invest in a software that's gonna work, that's actually gonna give you the benefits of software, this is what it costs. Like, candidly, we're priced really fairly. I'm not giving you some exorbitant amount to come way down. Like, we kinda come in where we come in, and a lot of your peers have have done that as well. So I'm happy to connect you with customers if you wanna get more familiar with the product and feel more comfortable about actually using a tool that managers, that leaders, that executives are very happy with, not just compensation teams. How much do you find yourself in some of these enterprise deals being forced to, quote, unquote, quantify the value in, like, a proper ROI number versus just having, like, a list of big problems that you're solving for the organization and letting them figure out how they wanna size up those problems. Pretty infrequently, which might shock you. This kinda comes back to what I was saying around enterprise having solved this problem before, having allocated budgets for these types of things. It's a lot different than I've sold, you know, to the series b startup where they're like, okay, I'm the VP of HR, and and I'm gonna go pitch this to the CFO. That doesn't really happen in enterprise. Sometimes it does, but, like, in reality, different departments have budgets. They're deciding what they wanna do with them. They have very clear, like, OKRs for the year. That's what they're going after. It's pretty cut and dry. So those ROI calculators can be really helpful, but I actually find that it's the less experienced buyers that are looking more for those types of tools to help them pitch internally. And oftentimes, those are the deals that are much shakier in my experience, where, like, you put together this ROI and it goes nowhere. Because what that really was telling me was that the buyer doesn't have buy in from everyone else already, and they're looking to try to make a pitch, and the pitch may or may not work. Based on that late stage in a deal, you've got a champion or even an exec who's bought in on this, but they still have to go, like, make some sort of case to their team to justify why they should do this. If you're not doing this, like, massive quantification of the ROI, what sort of things are you doing or collateral are you enabling your champion or exec buyer with to help them socialize and secure the investment on their end? I think if you can put together an ROI, it's hard for me to do that with my product. It's a great resource. I know Workday does that. People love it. A lot of times, the buyers that I'm working with, they actually have done a lot of this work already. Meaning, like, if I'm selling them a compensation planning tool, the reason that they're probably looking for another tool is because they just ran a retro on their last cycle, and they had a ton of terrible feedback. They've actually documented a lot of this stuff already. So don't be afraid to leverage work that your buyer's already done. So that usually gives me at least an outline, if you will. And then I would always optimize for simple, simple, simple, simple, simple. Unless you're selling, like, a core product that impacts every executive very heavily, you need to go for efficiency. Think that your buyer has one minute to pitch why they should be buying Pave, one slide, one thirty second loom, like, bite size. Go bite size. Don't go big. Focus on, like, the main areas of feedback that your buyer probably shared with you early on. Show just those things and then cut it. And then give your contact information. If they have questions, great. Otherwise, again, just like go for simple. You're you're selling the 20%, not selling the entire product. The 20% that really mattered is 80% of why they're buying your product. Phenomenal. Morgan, killer episode. The clock is ticking, though, and we gotta move to the final question, which is we've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now we gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of sellers exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Stop being so glued to dogma. We've covered a lot of these controversial topics today. Maybe one, like, really specific example. Earlier this week, I was doing a demo for 15 executives, literally. And at the end of the demo, you know, I just kinda said, like, thank you so much for hosting us. Like, we'll be in touch. And my boss was like, hey. Quick feedback. Like, really glad that you didn't ask for next steps. And I was like, obviously, those have been super cringe, but I've seen people do that. So read the room. Don't do your actionable tip just because you feel like you need to check that box if it's not the right fit. Don't be afraid to think a little bit critically. Read the room. Make sure that the audience is the right audience for what you're gonna do because the tips are great, but they need to be used in the right context. Phenomenal. Morgan, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Morgan Mello. What do you have for your two? So number one is assume that your buyer has sixty seconds to pitch their CEO on why they should buy your product. That means when you are sending over recaps or why they should buy or things to help enable them to have that conversation with the executive team, it should probably be three bullet points, not a full deck. Number two is to set a midpoint agenda or set an agenda if the call starts to go off the rails. Morgan shared the example of, like, sometimes you get into a call and the buyer, like, pushes you into content right away. And you can reset an expectation ten minutes in by resetting the agenda and saying something like, look. You know, we've gotten to know each other a little bit here. I've enjoyed the conversation we've had. I think the best use of our time for the next twenty minutes would be, and then reestablish your agenda. You can use this if you forgot to set one. You can also use it if the call direction has started to go away from where you know it needs to go. Number three, Morgan uses something called the Vibe demo where instead of doing discovery before demo, she actually does the demo and starts with all the different products that they have because Pave has a lot of products that, frankly, people don't know about. And then in the second call, she goes back to discovery and asks them what resonated the most with them. And then lastly, number four, when you're doing that, all you have to do is if someone says, hey. I really like the plan product or I really like the ability to automate recommendations for managers, you can just flip it, and you can say, great. Typically, when someone wants to automate recommendations, they're trying to solve problems like x, y, and z. Mhmm. And that gets you far quicker to problem agreement than doing discovery in this, like, abstract environment where they have no idea what your product does. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So one of my favorite things about the way that Morgan sells is the way that she asks questions and navigates the conversation. It doesn't really feel like a sales call. It never feels like she's trying to trap the buyer in a corner where they've got explicit pain that allows her to close the deal and sell. The questions that she asks, they don't really feel like sales questions. And it reminds me of something that you and I put together, Arman, which was this free toolkit of seven different question types that you can ask that actually don't feel like sales questions. And so if you like the way that Morgan sells and like having your sales calls not really feel sales y, you might enjoy this free toolkit. We've got a link in the show notes. Go check it out. Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week on the show.
