## Transcript

Your prospect is confused. So they'll say something like, oh, we've already got a solution for that. But when they describe their solution, it's actually, like, not what you do at all. There's a saying in sales where, like, when you're explaining, you're losing. And one of the worst things you can do in this scenario is be like, hey. Hold on. No. No. No. Like, here's how we're different. Because the moment you do that, they're like, this person's trying to pitch me, and they're already, like, one foot out the door. Instead, what you need to do is you actually need to, like, what's going on, folks? Good friend of mine who runs a pretty big sales team, lots of SDRs, said that team was struggling with this one objection that actually sounds kinda weird, but it comes up really often in sales. I'll call it your prospect is confused. So they'll say something like, oh, we've already got a solution for that. But when they describe their solution, it's actually, like, not what you do at all. I'll I'll give an example. Like, if you were selling SoulCycle classes, it would be like if someone was like, I've got a a gym membership. It's like, yeah. Like, that kind of works. I guess if you had, like, a gym membership that had fitness classes, that would be an objection. But it's like, that's not exactly what SoulCycle does. SoulCycle and a gym membership can actually coexist, and they usually do. There's a saying in sales where, like, when you're explaining, you're losing. And one of the worst things you can do in this scenario is be like, hey. Hold on. No. No. No. Like, here's how we're different. Because the moment you do that, they're like, oh, this person's trying to pitch me, and they're already, like, one foot out the door. Instead, what you need to do is you actually need to, like, play dead and agree with the objection and oh, I totally get it. You got that thing taken care of. And then you need to ask them a question that gets them to realize it on their own terms that you're different, and that's when you can go in and explain or educate. And folks, I'm gonna be, like, white boarding a lot of this stuff out, and so I definitely recommend, like, watching this on YouTube if you aren't already. So let's dive in. So we'll handle this one in three steps using what I call the mister Miyagi method to handle any objection. If you haven't heard it before, we've talked about it a lot on this channel and in our book. But the three steps are you need to, one, agree with the objection, which is the wax on. You don't try to, like, counter the punch right away with another punch. You need to redirect the momentum of the punch, or the objection in this case, by agreeing with it. So when you agree with an objection, usually, a prospect's like, oh, like, this this this guy's not gonna try to, like, pitch here. And all of a sudden, like, this pressure of the sale is released where they open their mind again. They're actually, like, listening to you, and that's what allows you to ask them a question, and that's what we call incentivize conversation. In other words, I'm gonna say something like, hey. Just so no one from my team calls you again, could you tell me about this? And that question is what usually exposes more information about the objection because you don't have enough information to handle it, or it gets, like, the prospect to realize something on their own terms. Alright? So that's step two. And then once they're like, we don't do that, or like, that does sort of suck, that's when you don't come in with the pressure pitch. You don't try to sell the product. You don't try to sell the car. You sell the test drive. In other words, you're like, hey, are you like open to taking a look at this thing not for now, but for later? Like, don't try to pitch. The moment you pitch on a cold call, you reapply the pressure, and that's when your prospects run away. The goal is to, like, get them to sit in the car. So we'll call this the confused objection. Let's run this through these three steps. Okay? So I used to sell compensation software at a company called Pave. I was VP of sales there, 11 from 0 to 10,000,000 an hour in eighteen months, and we would run into this objection all the time. What would happen is most companies have some sort of, like, HR platform. If you've ever been paid by a company, you probably got paid on, like, Gusto or Rippling or Justworks or Workday. Wherever you were getting your pay stubs was where, like, their HRIS platform was. The vast majority of HRIS platforms do not handle compensation planning, which is what Pave does. So Pave basically says, hey. I'm gonna take all your employees and all of your performance ratings and, like, market data based on, like, the average rate for a software engineer. I'm gonna say, like, based on the performance of this engineer and where they are relative to market, like, here's what comp increase you should give them. And most companies do this in spreadsheets with, like, a million different, like, VLOOKUPs and macros, and then they just, like, plug the results into their their HRIS. So a lot of times people would confuse it because they'd be like, no. We we run payroll with Gusto, or they'll, like, think we're a payroll provider because we're talking about compensation, and that wasn't true. So step one is I've actually gotta agree with the objection because I can't just explain or pitch pave on why it's different because they're already resisting on a cold call. Remember, this is, like, the first reaction. K? So agreeing with the objection, let's say that they're on gusto. It might say like, hey, Jane. Totally get it. Like, honestly, I should have assumed that your team had this totally taken care of with gusto. Like, it seems like you're on a pretty tight ship. That's step one. Jane's like, okay. He's like, not gonna pitch me. I guess we can go now. And now I'm gonna say, hey. Step two, incentivize. Just so no one from my team calls you again, that must mean that you're not doing any, like, performance based comp increases. Right? Where it's like you've got a merit matrix where if someone has, like, a performance rating of a three and they're below market, like, they get a 5% increase versus a performance rating of four and above market, then they get, like, a 6% increase. You're not doing, like, anything like that. It's probably just, like, straight flat comp increases. And they'll usually be like, no. We are doing that. Like, we do that on spreadsheets, and we plug it at Augusto. And that's when they come to the answer on their own. They're like, oh, like, is that what you do? And that's where I'm gonna match their o with, like, my o. And I'm gonna be like, o. Yeah. Like, honestly, I was a little bit confused when you said you do this thing on gusto because I imagined you wouldn't be doing, like, flat increases anymore. Yeah. So, like, the way this thing works is, like, now I can start to, like, explain oranges versus apples. Right? We'll call this OJ versus apples. And I can be like, we never replace Gusto. Like, usually, like, that process in spreadsheets is like a huge pain. And Pave essentially takes care of, like, all that stuff that you're doing with, like, the macros and the VLOOKUPs and, like, pulling in your comp bands. We handle all that. My guess is you're probably not gonna buy this thing anyway. Got a pretty good process with Gusto. Maybe you're a master of VLOOKUPs or whatever, but, like, are you open to taking a look at this thing just so you know it's out there and you can see how they sort of play together? So, like, notice I'm, like, explaining the difference. I'm saying, like, yeah. All that stuff you're doing on spreadsheets, it usually sucks, and we do this at Pave instead. And then one of two things will happen when you actually get them to understand what you do. So you go from confused to they'll either be like, oh, yeah. That spreadsheet thing sort of sucks. And at which point, you're like, okay. Cool. Like, I'll book the meeting because spreadsheets suck. And then from there, you can go and, like, sell them on why you're better than spreadsheets. It's pretty straightforward. Other answer is they'll be like, no. Like, the spreadsheets are actually, like, pretty good. They like their spreadsheets. K? And so now this actually brings us into a competitor objection. So when you go through, like, a confused objection, one of two things happen. You clarify the difference, priority for me, at which point you book the meeting. Or they're like, oh, now I get it. But, yeah, that's not really a problem. Like, we do this through this other competitor or this other solution. And now, guess what? That's when you run Miyagi again. So let's, like, treat spreadsheets like a competitor here. Even though it's sort of like an in house solution, you handle them the same way. They're basically, like, doing something that you do a different way. So we'll go through these three steps again. You're gonna agree with the objection as step one. K? So when you're agreeing with the objection, I'm gonna say the same exact thing. I'll be like, honestly, I said it before. My guess your team is probably pretty good on spreadsheets. Like, I saw the comp analyst that you hired. Like, she's awesome. She worked at Expedia and, like, probably had to do this at the scale of, like, millions of people, and you've got, like, 500 people, so you're good to go. It's like, oh, okay. The seller gets it. Yada yada yada. Remove the pressure of the sale. From there, I'm gonna incentivize conversation. K? And notice, I'm gonna ask a different trap question. I need to ask a question that is, what is the thing that I do that I know spreadsheets don't do? What's the thing that we do that I know Gusto doesn't do? I know Gusto or your HR platform won't handle, like, performance based comp increases. So I was like, hey, you must not be doing performance based comp increases. Right? Now I'm gonna run that same play, but with spreadsheets. And so I know spreadsheets are good for, like, pretty simple comp increases, but I know that spreadsheets make it really hard to do equity comp. And the reason for that is when people are getting stock option bonuses, a lot of times their bonuses are based on how much equity they have. But the value of their equity is determined based on, like, when they started at the company. If they started early stages, they might be, like, a millionaire on paper, and, like, their equity bonus is gonna be, like, pretty minuscule relative to the equity that they already have versus if they just started last week, their equity isn't worth very much. So you need to, like, take into account all of the equity they have when you're considering how much of a comp increase I'm gonna give them. But the problem is HR people don't even have access to all of that data. Pave does because it integrates with the systems of the CFO too. And so I know that if they're planning equity in spreadsheets, they're probably, like, heckling their CFO or, like, they have this janky work around process. So I'm just gonna ask them, like, just so no one for my team calls you again. Like, I know I'm really pushing it here, but, like, you probably aren't doing, like, stock option based bonuses or anything like that. Are you just doing, like, cash based comp increases? Nine times out of 10, I knew I was calling venture backed companies that were doing that, and they'd be like, no. We are. That's also in our spreadsheets or our CFO handles it. And that's when I can sell the test drive. And I'm like, ah. So, like, I totally get this. Honestly, again, you're probably not gonna buy this thing. But, like, now I can educate them on the difference. I can be like, usually, when managers can't see cash and equity altogether in one place, like, they'll oftentimes, like, give people a bigger cash bonus because they don't realize, like, how much this person's, like, making out on their stock options. Pave helps you, like, plan all that stuff all together in one place without you having to, like, heckle your CFO. I know I pushed my limit here. There are a lot of companies like y'all who have worked with us in the past and, like, are you open to taking a look at this thing just so you know it's out there? And then if it's not a fit, like, you're a little bit more informed for your next comp cycle. And nine times out of 10 at that point, if you handle the second objection, that's usually when you get the meeting. Right? So you go from, like, confused to competitor. And if you handle two objections, you'll usually get through it. If you get a third objection at that point, like, you might get the meeting. But I usually find that, like, once you get to, like, three or four, like, the person is just, like, they're coming up with anything. And at this point, they're either gonna hang up or, like, they're actually just, like, not open to meeting with you, and at which point you can move on. To recap, we talked about the confused objection where you agree with the objection. You say, hey, totally get it. You're using Gusto. I should have assumed you had this unlocked. You incentivize conversation that pokes a hole that gets them to realize the confusion on their own terms. You're like, hey. You must not be using performance based compensation where you have to do this, this, and this. It really sucks. It's confusing. You probably don't have to do that in Gusto. Right? They're like, no. We do. It's in spreadsheets, and it sort of sucks. You sell the test drive. You're like, oh, yeah. Here's what we do versus Gusto. Are you open to taking a look? They say, yes. Spreadsheets suck? Cool. Book the meeting. They say, no. I like my spreadsheets. This really isn't a problem. At which point, you go then handle the spreadsheet competitive objection with the same three steps, agree, incentivize, test track. So folks, if you like this one, I've got two things for you. Number one, we broke down 18 objection talk tracks and wrote out the scripts for every single one of them. I'll put a link to that toolkit here in the show notes, or it'll pop up somewhere here. It's literally free. Go download all those talk tracks. The confused one is actually not in there, so this is new. And then step number two is our course is, like, the ultimate step by step guide on how to win on the cold call from opener through objection through, like, how you plan your day. The entire section two, which is, like, three or four videos, is nothing but objections. It goes through the full Mr. Miyagi approach, like multiple examples by industry, the tone you should be using for every single objection, plus it goes through, like, all of the talk tracks so you can really get the stuff down. So I definitely recommend checking that out. And folks, if you like this one, it would mean a ton to me. We're trying to grow this channel. If you liked, subscribe, and then told me what you wanted to see next in terms of an objection down below. It's the number one way you could tell the algorithm that you like this type of content, and that's what allows us to keep doing this stuff. Alrighty, folks. Catch you soon.

Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes.
