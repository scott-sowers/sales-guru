## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Armand Farouk, and I'm here with my co host, Mark Casagua. And today, we have a badass sales leader who has also been a multiple time 30 MPC guest. It's Kyle AC. He is the RVP of sales over at MongoDB. And holy smokes. If you thought he had sales chops, this man has leadership chops too. Mark, why should people listen? Well, first of all, Kyle AC, he's obviously, his last name is because he's cool as a cucumber. This dude has got it going on. And what I mean by that is I always say process makes you great. Documentation makes you legendary. And this guy has documented what he thinks works for reps on how to be competent at the job so that he can create a very structured coaching program for individual sellers, not at a team or org level. And I think that he's just really found that secret button of what do young sellers want in their career to really level up and perform well. And what they want is growth, personal growth. And I think he's really tapped in on how to scale personal growth and individual coaching. But wait. Before we get started, Kyle also referenced a pretty massive competency framework where he has all the different disciplines and skills in sales and the metrics and ways he trains to each of them. And you can get that spreadsheet right now in the show notes before the episode starts. We'll reference it again at the end in the outro, but you should go grab it again now. Stay tuned in a three, two, one. Let's ride. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Kyle. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. Let's start with my favorite, my good day framework. I found that with every team I've led going in, there's a lack of clarity on what a great day actually looks like. What I don't want is micromanagement. What I do want is accountability. And so I recommend for every leader, sit down with your reps and help them define from their point of view what a great day looks like. Now any top performing rep will love to be held accountable to what they agree makes them successful. You have to define it. You have to have buy in on it, and then you have to track it because things that are tracked and measured and reported on will perform better than things that are not. Boom. What's number two? Number two is my anti skill will matrix. I don't wanna label people as high skill or low will. It's too broad. I wanna go understand people at the competency or the skill level. And even beyond that, I don't want to go say, oh, a rep is good or bad at prospecting. It's still too broad. Because within prospecting, there is account mapping, there's understanding personas, there's messaging, there's operating rhythm. There's all these aspects. So as a leader, you need to go figure out what are all the micro skills that make your best people great. What are the skills they're exemplifying? Then you need to figure out a way to track performance and progress for all your reps against those skills and build your performance improvement plans around those competencies where your reps need the most help for immediate impact. Uh-oh. He's talking performance improvement plans. What's number three? My third is my favorite metric, which is next quarter's weighted pipeline. So quick definition, if you have a 100 k deal and your 50% comp is gonna close, that's $50,000 of weighted pipeline. 50% of a $100,000. The reason why I love this is it's always controllable. No matter what a rep's current pipeline status is, they can go generate more pipeline. It's not paralyzing where if I could tell the rep with bad pipeline, you need to go hit your quota this quarter, there's not a ton they can do with long sales cycle to make that happen. And then my favorite outcome, it actually improves your billing pace because consistent pipeline generation to the quarter leads to greater linearity in your billing later on. Alright. Well, listen. I think there's three really interesting things to explore in there, Kyle. So let's take the last one, which is the one I love the most, which is the anti skill will concept. Right? I think that a lot of people want to bucket reps into, Hey, they got the skill, but they don't wanna do the work or they're willing to do the work. They just don't know how to do it. Dig into that a little bit more for me. Like how are you taking those competencies and breaking them down so that there's not like a 30 things that you're grading skill versus will on? So the the funny thing is sometimes there are quite a few things that you grade, but then it's what you choose to focus on to prioritize. I have never, in all my years doing this, I have never had a rep go through every single competency because I don't think there's any rep that I've ever worked with that is actually extremely proficient at every single detail in the sales process. But what it allows me to do is go identify what are the most urgent opportunities for progression. And so when I'm looking at a rep, usually it pretty well aligns with top of funnel towards bottom of the funnel. Top of funnel is often for a newer rep more urgent because even if we go improve negotiation incrementally, they're gonna be better off getting way more pipeline than increase in average deal size by three to 5%. Right? But when you have reps more in the middle of the ramp, being able to go look at the entire sales process and identify the skills where they are weakest, you can work collaboratively to determine where should we spend our time to get the greatest output if we were to improve this scale incrementally. So how many different attributes do you think that are worth measuring? Are you talking, like, a dozen, a couple dozen? Like, how many things are you kind of assessing and who's doing that assessment? So, at Mongo right now, we have a little over 30 that we actually look at, but we don't go teach all those ever. The most we'll focus on in one quarter is three. If it's a complex skill, no more than one. The way the assessment works is every quarter, the rep and the RD will do an assessment of each competency, and then they'll agree together what is most urgent to go work on. Keep in mind, a lot of the things that a rep may be deficient in, that we're not gonna work on right now, we have support functions to go help. Complex negotiation, you're gonna pull in your RD, you're gonna pull in me. Very technical, you're gonna bring in our solution architect team. We have support to go help close those deficiencies. Then, on a weekly basis, we're working on these skills and we're talking about how we're tracking towards the metrics we agree to be improved upon if we improve the skill. So very simple example. Let's say the skill we're working on is messaging. We might be looking at the number of calls and emails required to set a medium. We want to decrease that ratio. We look at the baseline, we look at the goal and then the operating rhythm is we teach what good messaging looks like, we show good examples, and then we have the rep show the activity, and then we get feedback on that. And then we repeat as necessary until we hit the agreed upon metric to show that we've mastered that skill, and then we move on. But this is an ongoing part of our operating rhythm. When I meet with my leadership team, we talk about the plans they have for their reps. I give input on where they should focus. And when they get stuck on, well, I'm not sure how to measure progress with this skill, or I'm not sure how to coach this skill, That's where I can weigh in and hopefully get some guidance on the right way to approach. Does every skill have, like, a qualitative competency area that you're looking at and then a qualitative measure, or are there multiple quantitative measures underneath? Like, help me understand how you're organizing that because 30 things is a whole lot to measure, and then each one has a lot of nuance inside of it is my guess. So is it really prescriptive, or is it just like, hey, messaging, we feel like could improve, but here's five areas to go and spec to see which area we need to really assign a metric to. So the metric piece, the earlier in the sales cycle, the simpler it is. Because once she gets a bottom of the funnel, if I look at something like close rate or average deal size, there are so many things that can go into that that might not even be the competency that we're working on. And so what I find is for some of the more advanced skills, it's a bit more qualitative, actually. If there's things like we need to improve at how we are uncovering and teaching negative consequences, the follow through may be as simple as the RD is going to review your command to the message deck, agree that they're calling negative consequences, and that can be the way that we're looking at success. For things that are a bit more easy to quantify, like discovery skills, how well are we finding pain? That could be as simple as, well, what is our conversion rate from initial meeting to opportunity? Those are more quantitative. What I don't wanna do is overcomplicate this. Right? I don't wanna even though there's a lot of things we can work on, I'm only ever looking at one to three, and I'm only measuring based on one possible outcome. And it's either going to be qualitative if it's more complex and nuanced or quantitative and it's more straightforward. So, Kyle, just to get a sense of the scale that this is happening about, could you remind me how many folks are in your org as it stands today? A little over 35 right now if you could my leadership team. So over 35. So let's say that I'm running a team of 35 and maybe that's three, four, however many managers you have. What is the training program look like for an org of that size? Is it one big 35 person all hands and then the managers are doing the one on one in reinforcement? Do you prefer to keep this in a more small group type of setting? The way that I look at it is whenever I have cohorts that are at similar competency levels, I wanna group those together for peer learning, it's much more scalable. And so we have the same leader led onboarding program for all of our new hires. They go through all the fundamentals together, and we have ways we track their progress to graduate them through that. However, once they get through onboarding, that's where we begin to see deviation and how quickly reps progress based on their prior experience, their aptitude, whatever it might be. That's where training and enablement becomes one on one and is a requirement for me. That's my biggest thing for my group. If you get anything from being in my org, it's gonna be a targeted coaching program. At the org wide level, we're always looking for opportunities for what is a consistent deficit across the team, and then we try to approach those as a group. It's just really challenging to teach something effectively to a large group when you have such a range and experience, tenure, and acumen for what we're selling. Right? And so if I'm going to over index on one or the other, I'm going to over index on enabling my RDs to go do really effective one to one coaching and training because that is what I have found to make the biggest impact for individual rep development. So I love hearing that. I I it's sad how many leaders don't quite understand how important that coaching is and coaching is always a thing that gets squeezed first, like get into more deal calls, make sure your forecast is right. Get into your numbers and coaching gets squeezed. How are you Kyle? Like, it sounds like you're doing a really good job holding back the squeeze and, like, making people focused on, like, this is our biggest impact. You can forecast 10% better, but coaching 10% better is gonna have way more impact than forecasting 10% better. Like, how are you holding back the tide of pressure to do the things that most sales managers are doing right now besides coaching? Yeah. At the risk of sounding super, super cheesy, it's just I I've kinda bought into how I wanna lead my org, and I'm gonna stick to that mission. And my biggest thing is if you bet your career on my org, you are going to lead my org a better seller. Like, that that is what's most important to me. I'm going to enable you. I'm gonna teach you, and I'm gonna hold you accountable. I'm gonna ask you to work really hard. But the beautiful thing I've found is when I have a culture of we develop you, I have a culture of accountability, forwarding you to what you agree makes you effective. The result has always been high quota attainment, high promotions that leads to high engagement scores, that leads to low attrition. And so even though I'm not putting the squeeze on as much, the results are good. And so they go do it. Listen. I think it's pretty much proven this kind of new generation of sellers. What they care about most is are they getting coached up and growing? Like, that's what they're addicted to. That's what drives them. That's what motivates them. And, you know, I can remember early in my sales career that wasn't the case. And my generation of sellers were much more money motivated. And I'd never understood why won't you put in the time to grow yourself? But now this generation of sellers has come out. There's like, just grow me. I know I'll make money if I grow, but there's a whole generation of leaders that are still like, we need to motivate them with comp plan and all that kind of stuff. But it sounds like you've really kind of zagged and like leaned into what that group of sellers really wants, which is that personal growth and coaching. That's awesome. I think I've also learned the importance of context. Like, I've seen so many bad decisions made when people just look at data and don't go a layer deeper. I'm not against data. I love data. I love looking at data, but I've learned, like, I'm never gonna go make a big decision off of just the data until I have conversations that validate my hypothesis. And so I think that human element, that understanding that comes from being close to the team, that plays a big role as well in creating a more positive culture than just the make more calls, make more dials kind of culture that is prevalent. I remember we rolled out Sandler at Carta. There was a new VP of sales in town, and that org was something like a 100 odd people. And I was really eager to be developed. I was a younger rep at the time, and I was soaking it all in. But there was an old guard of managers. There were something like 15 plus managers in that organization that were inherited by this VP, and they're probably split fifty fifty. Half of them were like, alright. I'll give this thing a shot. Half of them were like, go throw your upfront contract in the trash, and they would make jokes about the session after leaving. Right? And so anytime the VP would try to, like, do something where he's gonna be like, I wanna make sure that all of our calls start with upfront contracts or something like that, it would be like shouting into the ether and then he would lose energy. And eventually, it just became a training that happened once at a sales kickoff. You wasted two days, and then no one ever actually ended up closing the loop and making sure that these reps actually did it. And so how do you get your middle managers bought into this thing? Because they're the ones who ultimately need to be having these day to day conversations with the rest. How do you make sure that they actually do these things? So when I first rolled out my good day framework in my org at Mongo, it was loosely ruled out in the other part of what was not yet my org, And it was not adopted at all because it was like, Hey, we're gonna try this. Apparently it works, go for it. And then it never went anywhere, right? It was trained on and then forgotten. Eventually that org rolled into my org and I wanted to implement it. And so I sat down with a leader that had previously tentatively proposed it, but not executed it. And I just made sure that they were bought in. I walked them through my why for it, how I'd seen it work, the ownership they would have, and then literally worked with them to prepare to roll it out to their team. Then the next meeting, they showed me why they were beginning to get bought in, their concerns with it. I helped resolve the concerns, but then I was with them to make sure that they understood the complete why behind it. And so I know nothing groundbreaking, understand the why behind things, but I make sure that I'm not pushing my leaders to go do anything that they don't actually believe in. If they don't believe in it, I want to understand why and oftentimes make changes to it to make sure that they are bought in because oftentimes they're not bought in for a really good reason. And if they're not bought in because I'm missing something, I'm missing context, I'm missing perspective, I want them to correct me so what we roll out, they're fully confident in. One of the worst things you can do as a second line or third line or whatever leader I think is pushing anything to the ICU level that you don't have complete buy in from your leadership team first. Because anything that requires change, discomfort, if you don't have that complete adoption full buy in, the message passed on is diluted. And then if it's 70% bought in at the frontline leader level, it's gonna be 30% at the IC level. Then your leader becomes less bought in because in their perception, well, we tried it and it's not working and then it all falls apart. So that's how I've tried to roll things out. I haven't always done it perfectly. I've rolled up plenty of things that have failed. But the things that have worked out really well have been when I take the time to get full buy in, give my leaders input, make changes where necessary, and then roll it out more broadly. One of my first VPs of sales tell me you can be a filter or a microphone. And you want your frontline managers to be a microphone for the company's message, but more often than not, they're filters because they don't buy in. They don't understand. They just feel like it's another methodology of the quarter or whatever. And I, I really like that. Let's get people bought in and really into what we're doing. Guys, I wanna go back to your first actionable takeaway. And the reason for that is I believe I'm going to spark an angry old man debate between me who's a young person, not relatively. I'm I'm 31 year old living in a 70 year old's body. And then we got old man, get off my lawn, Mark, ready to pick a fight with Kyle. So, Mark, I wanna hear your perspective on this whole connects versus cold call activity debate. In other words, how do you think about holding someone to a 200 dial a week commit versus a 20 connect per week commit, for example? And why is that a different philosophy that you might have? Yeah. So to me, I think it's tomato tomato potato potato. The thing that everybody is trying to solve for, in my opinion, is we don't want people to feel like we're just asking them to do empty calorie activity. And we also don't wanna do something that allows them to just go do the numbers real quick and do something to get the numbers done. For example, 200 dials. If I could dial the same number 50 times, I can do that in ten minutes if I want to do it right. So, well, maybe we should do connects instead. Well, guess what? I can call my mom five times to get my five connects in five minutes and move on to, right? So there's always a way to cheat. I think what's interesting is, is as a leader, you need to look upstream and downstream. And how far upstream do you want to go to help make sure that your team understands that there's still a connection to downstream results? Like the reason that Kyle does connect, understands that there's still a connection to downstream results? Like, the reason that Kyle does connects is because he wants people to have conversations, because he wants people to get in the pipeline. Right? You can go upstream to dials, or you can stay at connects to do that. And I think that that's a philosophical choice that you need to figure out. But I think, like, you know, for me, I think that everything is gameable. Everything can be figured out. We just don't want people doing empty calories. I think it's just like, where can you find the truest source of data so that people can understand what you're doing? And do you clearly communicate to people why you're having them do it? So that it's not just like, well, I gotta check this box so I don't get in trouble. You know, 200 dials a day, keep your manager away. You know, like that doesn't work in sales. So, Armand, maybe not the big fight you were hoping for. I actually agree with all of that. The biggest reason why I have gravitated towards measuring conversations, not calls, is that's what my teams have preferred to be measured by. That is something that is easier for them to buy into psychologically. It ends up being the same thing, right? Because the ultimate outcome is sufficient pipeline to hit our targets. Ultimately, what I want is weighted pipeline for next quarter, always increasing, quota attainment for this quarter, always consistent. But when I'm rolling this out and the reps are dipping their feedback, I get more buy in and more excitement that they can go chase down conversations. And so for me, because it is probably tomato, tomato, potato, potato, whatever the rest prefer, I'll measure it. And I'm going to pick my battles when a rep says, Well, I really want to get bonus points for some worthless activity, and I don't want to give credit for that. So I agree with it. I've found benefit in the conversations piece simply because from a rep psychology standpoint, they have been more motivated by that metric. But it's still really important for me to know number of dials because I can look at conversions. Right? I still wanna know how many calls did they make to get x number of conversations, how many converted conversations from initial meeting opportunity all the way to the funnel, all super important to me. But all the Good Day framework is trying to accomplish is reps know every single day what a good outcome is. And I know every single day which ones are not. And then I have a big amount of data to go coach off of. I can go see what types of points they're earning are leading to good outcomes. We can go look at reps' data and say, okay, this rep, it takes them 14 points on average to book a DM. It takes this rep eight points on average to book a DM. Where are the differences? It becomes a coaching tool. So how I define what we measure isn't as important to me as long as it's leading to a good outcome. So I think this is interesting because to your guys' point, it's a little bit of tomato to model. I guess I'll stoke the fire a little bit because one of my SDR managers back at Pave, he switched the team to tracking commits instead of dials, and I was freaking pissed. And the reason I was pissed is I was like, any idiot can make 200 bad dials, but I want you to make 200 good dials, not 200 idiotic dials. And so make your 200 freaking cold calls, you lazy bum. That's your North Star metric. But your constraint metric is you need to make those 200 dials at a connect rate that is not abysmal, and you need to have a set rate that is over 15%. Otherwise, you freaking suck on the phones, dude or gal, but you cannot get to 20 connects off of 20 dials. It's just nearly impossible. And that's why I usually found that it was most helpful to give them the leading indicator that no matter what they could control, they could always control how many times they picked up the phone and then coach to how they do that thing more intelligently or more effectively. But, again, he was speaking to the people, and I know the rest were starting to complain about not being coached to connects versus being coached to volume of dials. Arman, I think it's an important point there is, like, when you set, and I think you're talking about this a little bit earlier too, Kyle, is when you set a metric that isn't controllable, like for example, your favorite metric is next quarter weighted pipeline coverage. Right? Because you can always control that. I can sit down every day and can control making 200 quality dials. There's nothing that keeps me from doing that except for my own will. But I don't know if I can control getting 10 connects every day. Right? Like, I just don't know if that's gonna happen if I'm gonna get people. And so that's where I think it gets tough is, like, I want something that somebody can look at at the end of the day and to your point, be like, I did my job today. Am I not a booked a meeting? I might not talk to a single person, but you know what? My job is to make my 200 high quality dials, and I did that, so I did my job. And I think that that's where the manager comes in is the manager's job is efficacy, the ability to affect change. Can you get somebody to change behavior, results, mindset, energy? Can you do that or not? Right? And so if you can start with something that somebody can control, you can say, listen, are you doing the thing that you have total control over or not? And then can I change your results based on what you're doing? The manager's job is to take the effort of the rep and turn it into execution for the business. And that's where I like to have effort be something that nobody can tell me, hey. I couldn't do that yesterday because of x, y, and z. Like, no excuses. This is what we're gonna do. If you're doing that every day and it's not working out, that's your manager's fault. And your manager needs to dig in and help you turn that effort into execution. And I think just to kinda wrap the bow on the good day piece is with the way I have this set up is you can still have a good day if you don't get anybody live on the phone. There's other ways that you can earn points towards this. Those are high value activities. I like to track adding new contacts to your cadence, fresh prospects, new prospecting cadence. Right? Getting information via email exchange, setting meetings through email, personal development, creating opportunities off a discovery call. I think one of the biggest things I like to manage away from is reps confusing busy work with productivity because there are some reps, fair or not, that will fall into the trap of, well, I made a bunch of calls today. Didn't talk to anybody, didn't progress anything, but I still worked hard. That's an anomaly. I don't think it's a huge concern, but I really want reps thinking about outcomes tied back to the inputs that they're making. And so I try to find some balance in this and not have it be so binary where a good day can be had even if I make my calls and I don't talk to anybody. However, Rimsle incentivizing have a high quality list, fresh prospect to call, increasing the likelihood that somebody will pick up, and then coaching towards messaging to more likely to convert conversations to meetings. But the beauty of this whole thing is any manager, any rep can go adopt it to match your philosophy, what motivates your reps. It shouldn't be the same for me, Mark, and Armand. It should actually be completely different because we're different leaders, different people. And that's okay. Kyle, I really like this concept of mutual agreement and then accountability. And it's flexible. It takes into account someone's own opinion so that they have ownership over it. Like, how are you helping managers conduct those conversations so that the things that our rep and a manager agree on are really important, impactful things, and they don't kinda get off into some la la land where the stuff that they're agreeing on isn't really gonna help that rep be better. So I think there's a there's an interesting perception. Whenever I'm at a company of people outside my org that look at our process, look at our structure, and they'll think, oh, that looks kinda micromanagement y. Right? Like, you got this good day framework, you're tracking points. You've got this competent document, you're tracking all these skills, all these numbers, and it can look that way until you take into account what you just talked about, Mark, is to complete buy in. And so I need to enable my leaders to answer the question. My leaders need to be able to snuff out the crap. Right? Like, I've seen situations where reps will give their manager, hey, here's what I think you should expect of me. And it's terrible. Right? My leaders, I need to enable them to know what are good outcomes. And that should be consistent across the business. Right? We need to have strong definitions for what does a promotion look like, what does good enough look like, and then what is not satisfactory to be employed in our sales work. That needs to be consistent across teams. My leaders didn't know what that looks like and be able to identify it. That allows them, when working with the reps, to get their buy in on what they think they should be working on, what they think they should be held accountable to, that it passes the sniff test. That part's really pretty easy. The hard part in my experience has been helping leaders that are gravitating to the friend side of leadership, have those harder conversations and actually hold people truly accountable. And it's the shift away from, well, I'm here to be liked, I'm here to be respected to know, you are here to get the most out of these individuals that you're managing. And then my tagline, just to kind of seal the deal with my leaders is, look. If you have a rep that doesn't wanna be held accountable to what they've agreed to make some successful, and you've agreed to make some successful, why would you wanna work with them? And they never had a good answer for that question because we work in a high performing environment, and we wanna work with people that wanna hit their capacity. Boom. The final question. There are a lot of good habits we talked about today, and we're gonna talk about a bad one to break instead. So if there were one bad leadership habit that you could snap your fingers and make sure no one ever did it ever again in the world, what would that bad habit to break be? Decisions off of data without understanding context. It's so easy in QBRs. It's so easy in a senior leadership role to go look at data and build this story to support what you think is happening. And then you can go say or do things that you regret because you're upset, you're anxious, you're stressed. There is almost always context that while your decision may still be correct, may change the way you communicate it. And so I'm a big data guy, but as a leader, don't ever go make final decisions and decide how you're gonna communicate things off of just the data. Form a hypothesis, go get the context, then make your decision. Well, Kyle, this was an outstanding episode. Everyone, hang in for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers, folks.

Listen. I said it at the introduction that I think that he has a level of documentation and frameworks that is quite honestly, like, impressive. You know, I haven't seen many people that can come with that level of detail. And I think what's most interesting about this specific podcast is you can tell this dude Liz and Marissa stuff. Like he can go through that list. He can talk about every single thing. His methodology, he's not coming up with stuff on the spot. He is delivering the same sermon he delivers to his frontline managers every Sunday. And he did that on the podcast, and you could feel the authenticity of what he's doing. That's right, folks. And so a little surprise here is Mark actually asked. He's like, hey. Can I see all of those competencies you have mapped out? And Kyle pulled up a big spreadsheet of all the competencies, how he coaches to them, how he tracks them. You can actually get that in the show notes right now. So Kyle's giving that away for free to you also. Go check out all of his competencies. Go give Kyle some love on LinkedIn because he puts out some awesome freaking content, and stay tuned for the next one on 30 MPC. Peace out.
