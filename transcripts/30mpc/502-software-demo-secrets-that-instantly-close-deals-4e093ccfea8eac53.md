## Transcript

If you did a good job with your champion, they're gonna say, hey, we should show this to Dave and Mary and Emma and Dutch and Karen. Awesome. Great. Except that is a huge risk. Big group demos are where most B2B deals go to die. And if you've ever gotten on a Zoom to show a demo to six people who don't even know why they're there in the first place and gotten crickets anytime you tried to get those people to talk, you know what I mean. And so in this video, I'm gonna show you exactly what top performing reps do before their group demos to guarantee engagement, and then the contrarian multi threading approach that they do after the demo to keep the deal moving. Let's dive into this thing. So let's start with the play that you should be running before the demo. For group demos, you're almost always going to be demoing to people that you've never actually spoken to before because if you did a good job with your champion, they're gonna say, hey, we should show this to Dave and Mary and Emma and Dutch and Karen. Awesome. Great. Except that is a huge risk for you to get into the room with all of those people and start demoing to them the first time because you've literally never met them before. It's also kind of awkward for people because you're, like, trying to get people to speak up in this group setting and you don't really know them at all. And so this one might be a shocker, but what the best reps do before a group demo is they literally call, ring, ring, every single person on the attendee list before the demo and they try to have a live one to one conversation with each person. So what you're gonna do is get the full attendee list from your champion or just look at the calendar invite and see who's on it, and then call everybody and say something like, hey, Mary. I see that Mark invited you to our demo on Friday and I'm trying to build out our agenda for the session. I know Mark cared about seeing our analytics dashboards. I assume given that you're the director of IT, you might care about some of our integrations. But I wanted to see before we actually get in the big group meeting, was there anything that you really wanted to make sure we cover in our time together? Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive goes to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Now you have an opportunity to actually have a back and forth conversation and do some mini discovery with that person. Now, obviously, if they don't pick up, you're gonna leave a voice mail, and you're gonna say basically what I just said earlier and send an email saying pretty much the same thing. But most people in my experience actually are like, you know what? I would love to talk with you before the demo. And so now you start to build a mini relationship with not just your champion, but every single person who's actually gonna be in that big group meeting and is on the buying committee. The other benefit of this is, like, you're able to have so much more in-depth of a conversation when you set up these one to one side conversations than if you try to do it in the big group setting. If you think about, like, trying to do discovery with a group of six people, four or five of whom you've never met before, there's two problems. Problem one is, like, the clock is ticking and they came there to see a demo, not watch you do discovery one by one by one with the group. The other thing is those folks are encumbered by the bystander effect where they're like, okay, we've got six people. Nick's asking these, like, pain oriented questions. I'm sure Mark will speak up or I'm sure Emma will speak up. And that's part of the reason that you get crickets is you've never met these people before. You're trying to do discovery in a time compressed environment. You're also like pulling the rug out from under them where it was supposed to be a demo and you're you're trying to do discovery in the demo. So separate the two, have those one to one conversations in advance, and then when you show up, it's like, Hey Dave, good to see you again. Hey Mary, how you been? Cool. Here's what everyone wanted to see covered, let's dive in. And you will find that your big group demos run so much more smoothly when you do the work in advance. So now assuming that you did that first part well, your demo should have been at least not a total train wreck. Now what you do after, this sort of contrarian thing, can actually start to turbocharge the momentum in your behavior. So there's a two step follow-up that you're gonna take. So step one, just like you did before the demo, calling each person to get their agenda items and do some discovery, you're gonna do the same thing after. You're literally going to call one by one by one immediately after the demo the people who are in the room to get their feedback. And your goal here is to get the talk track you could use is find their phone number, call them, and you're gonna say, hey, Dave. I know we literally just got off of that demo, but I wanted to call you while things were fresh in your mind. One, I'm curious how you felt things went. And then two, I'm curious was there anything that we didn't cover that you were like, we really need to do a follow-up section on that. Your goal here now is to get that inside intel, the real reactions, and also you'll find that if you call each individual, you're gonna have folks that were like, man, I really love those analytics dashboards. I would love to go deeper on those. And now you can get into true multi threading where with Dave, you can do a deeper analytics demo. And with Mary, you can do an IT integrations conversation because that's really, really important to her. And now you're starting to work with multiple stakeholders, not just your champion or main point of contact, but you're working with the entire buying committee, selling in almost mini deal cycles with them. So call each person to do some more discovery, get the real reaction, set more meetings, and also figure out if there were any hot button issues that you might need to be careful about addressing in your recap email. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. So that brings us to step two, which is once you've gotten that inside intel, a huge mistake sellers make is they send one big recap email to everybody that was in the demo. Instead, what you're gonna do is you're still gonna send the big group recap email, but you are also going to follow-up one to one with each stakeholder with a personalized recap email that is tailored to the things that you heard they cared about in that pre demo call, the things that they said in the actual demo, and what you might have learned in the conversation that you had with them after the fact. Again, if you just send one big recap email to six people, folks are gonna succumb to the bystander effect, and literally no one is going to respond to your big meaty recap email. But if you send tailored one to one follow ups, you're actually gonna spark so much deeper conversation with people. And again, you're gonna start to create more internal champions. Just like when you do that post demo call, you will often find reasons to set more follow-up meetings with multiple people which is literally the definition of multi threading. And so to recap, pre demo, you're gonna do the work upfront. You're gonna call the attendees. You're gonna get their agenda. You're gonna do some mini not going to stumble into a full room having not talked to these folks before. And then after the demo you're gonna do the same thing. You're literally gonna call your champion and the other key stakeholders, do some more discovery, and then instead of just sending a big group recap email, yes you'll discovery, and then instead of just sending a big group recap email, yes, you'll send that one, you will also send personalized one to one recaps to every single stakeholder that was there. These are ways that you can totally turbocharge your deal momentum and derisk your big group demos to get an edge over your competitors. And so if you found this one helpful, hit subscribe.
