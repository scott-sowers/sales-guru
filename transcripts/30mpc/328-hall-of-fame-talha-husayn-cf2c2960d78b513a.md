## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Skalski. And today, we have the man who heads up all of SDR over at the one and only orem.io. It's mister Terry Hussain. Nick, why should people listen? Terry is a cold calling machine. He is cold. He's a caller. He's a machine. Well, he's not cold. He was a nice guy. But this was a great interview. If you wanna get better at booking meetings using the magic device called the phone, give it a listen. He is a warm, a three, a two, a one, a warm calling machine. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to knock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Terry. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. Super excited to be here, guys. So, you know, number one is do your research. And I know that sounds obvious, but the prospect should know, you know, why you're calling them, why you're calling their company, and why is now the right time to chat. And that should be within thirty seconds or they all have they have the right to hang up on you. There's a few bay ways to do this. First, account based research. Right? Any research that's at the account level that can be used across everyone. Prospect based research, things like, did they just join the company? Right? Were they at a previous company where they did really well? Do they know anyone? Are they want the same school as you? And the whole takeaway after that is, and this is where a lot of SDRs miss this, put it into the CRM once. Write it down. Reference it on every call. Beautiful. What's number two? So number two is permission based openers of the twist. They're great, but it's important to layer in the research that you have done. So social proof wins above all else. Right? But as well as any other research that you've done at the account level. So it might sound like, hey. This is Terry Usain at Orem. You know, I was doing a lot of research to hopefully earn this call. I saw that you were actually connected to my CEO, Jason. You're leveraging Outreach today, and it looks like you're hiring SDRs. So I think what we're doing might be relevant. Can I share a little bit about what we do, and you can tell me if it makes sense to schedule a longer conversation? Beautiful, Terry. What's number three? Round us out. So number three is asking better questions, leveraging that research. If you ask a generic question, you're gonna get a generic answer. Better questions, better answers. So for example, if you're asking how are they sourcing candidates today, let's say you're you're leveraging or selling, like, a technology to recruiters versus how long does it take your recruiting team to source a hired candidate, that latter one's gonna have more pain. They're gonna tell you how many hours, but they're also gonna allow you to jump into how they're doing that, you know, today. And so there could be a variety of different ways that you leverage that research. So for example, if I'm selling disaster recovery software, I might say, like, hey. I understand you have an on prem data center today. How are you migrating workloads into the cloud? Right? That's how you ask a better question with context. So, Terry, what's fascinating is what you're doing on your cold call opener is actually a mix of the two cold call openers that we typically teach at thirty minutes to presidents club. The first is the permission based opener, which is tends to be Nick's favorite, and the other is the heard the name tossed around opener, which is mine, where you lead with context. Right? One of the challenges with the permission based opener is if someone picks up the phone and you just say, hey. This is Terry from Orem. You weren't expecting my call, but can I get twenty seven seconds to tell you why I'm calling and then you can hang up on me then? Literally, they're gonna be like, okay. But I have no idea what you do. And now they're just like, alright. This could be rolling the dice and they could be trying to sell me a a fried chicken for all I know. And so what you're doing is you're instead just adding, hey. I know your CEO. Right? You're basically saying, like, hey. I'm in the same space as you. Right? Can I give you a reason why I'm calling? You have some creative ways around how to do social proofing in that opener. Can you talk about how you find things or what you use before you use the permission based opener? Yeah. And, I love that segue because this is a tactic that we use a lot at Orem. And for those who are unfamiliar with Orem, we're a live conversation platform. So we're delivering instant live conversations that does allow us, especially on the enterprise side, to be very strategic. We will call along all different sorts of titles, including the individual contributors of our technology, right, like an SDR, an AE, or even a sales ops person. And that's where we'll actually grab information, Armand. So we might confirm that they're on a specific tech stack. Or an SDR might say, yeah. Actually, I'm spending three hours a day cold calling. And so, you know, what this actually sounds like is, for example, one of my SDRs, Dave, on the team, crushed it on a cold call where, you know, the SDR manager had given an objection, and he, you know, understood, hey. I understand. Like, doesn't sound like you guys are mass dialing, but I spoke to, you know, so and so on your team yesterday, and they mentioned that they spend about two to three hours on the phone. Right? So if we're able to reduce that to fifteen to twenty minutes, they have more time for other revenue generating activities, you know, that would be worth taking a look at. And, you know, now the SDR manager knows that, hey. This person has spoken to other people. They have their research, and they know the pain points. So they're not gonna say, hey. That SDR is lying. They're a business person. So they said, yeah. Actually, got it. So you can actually time you can save me time. Got it. This isn't about making a thousand dials. This is about time savings. Okay. We'd love to chat. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive goes to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Terry, I'm curious about that that first conversation actually, like, with the SDR, with the people that are lower in the organization because I feel like most salespeople when they're making cold calls, they're like, they're so focused on I need to get the meeting and I don't know if you're necessarily are are you scheduling a meeting with these SDRs are you calling and just being like hey can you tell me how long you spend cold calling a day how are you opening those calls is it still a permission based opener and then how do you actually run that cold call to someone lower when you're just trying to get intel? I think it's unique to us that we might run a lightning demo. Like, a really quick demo is the definition of a lightning demo with, like, an individual contributor so that we could build some sort of groundswell, but we don't have to. And the way that we approach it is exactly the same way that we would approach any other conversation. So we still leverage that research. It's mostly account based because if you're trying to do personalization on every IC, that's just a lot of time. But using the account based research and then the thing that's a little bit different, Nick, is we always know what the objection's gonna be. I'm not the right person. I don't have power. Right? And so we're always in the process saying, hey. Totally understand that you're probably not the one making the final decisions on technology or even, you know, potentially taking the first look at it. My purpose in calling was just to understand if you guys had that pain. You know? You know, over here, I was an SDR previously at xPro. Right? And start trying to get into that IC, you know, thing. Like, we're using Outreach. You're using Outreach. And so that allows us to kinda jump into it. And surprisingly, a lot of ICs are not used to getting called. The other secondary piece is what if you're not talking to an IC? What if you're talking to a director, but they're a tangential role? Like, for example, let's say you're selling recruiting technology, but you're not talking to the director of recruiting. Maybe you're talking to the director of engineering instead because that you know that there's an they need to fill engineering roles. And you're just asking them, hey. I'm just generally curious. Like, how long does it take for you to source and hire an engineering candidate? The purpose is not to book a meeting, as you mentioned. The purpose is to get the information to use for when you get to the right person so that you can give that context. And now you're having a business conversation and not an objection of we don't have pain. So let's say I am that, like, head of engineering, and you and I have a three and a half minute conversation where I bemoan how much time it takes me to get a candidate recruited in, and I'm clearly frustrated. And let's say that meeting ends and I don't get you a referral. Right? Like, you know, I'm running into another meeting and you don't end with me saying, hey. Let me intro you to ahead of recruiting. But you have some intel and you you are aware that there is clear pain here and it's coming from someone in the organization. How are you weaving that into let's say, now you go call Arman, who is the head of recruiting. How are you calling Arman so that he is aware in the first eighteen seconds that, oh, this is legit? Yeah. Great question. So what I would first start off with is, like, hey, Arman. This is Terry from Aurum. I was just speaking with Nick the other day. I had reached out to him because we really work with a lot of directors of engineering and help them fill out a lot of their roles. And after speaking to him, I realized I should have actually reached out to you first. But lucky enough, we did discuss a lot of the pain points. He mentioned how it takes about thirty to sixty days to source candidates even just into the first stage one, and we actually help with that. So could I share a little bit about what we do, and you can tell me if it makes sense to schedule the conversation. One of the nuances I like about what you're doing there, Carrie, is I really love the phrase where you're like, I realized I should have been reaching out to you because what you're doing is you're saying, like, oh, like, I might have you're you're not saying, oh, I screwed up. You're like, oh, I actually had this hypothesis and I realized I was a little bit wrong. You're not this, like, seller with all of this bravado about how I've got it perfect all the time. You're like, hey. I talked to this person and I realized I didn't always get it right. I should have been talking to you. I feel like when you sort of admit that, they're far more open to heavy conversation with you. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Terry, I wanna actually go back to the point where you end that call with the director of engineering because there are a lot of things that you're doing that are super powerful in that handoff motion. My guess is you don't get to the end of the three or four questions you're asking them and say, okay. Bye. Right? My guess is you're you're asking for a referral, or you're asking transition as smooth as possible? Yes. I'm glad you brought that up. I should have clarified. We are trying to push for the referral, and I always tell SDRs, like, don't put work on them. Right? Like, this is why account based research is so important. We do it once is I might say, well, hey, Nick. It was great to chat with you. I appreciate this. I think our solution actually, based off what you mentioned, you know, might be a fit. This is what we do, short thirty second, sixty second pitch. Do you mind introducing me to Armand? Right? I see that he's the director of recruiting. Right? So you would go ahead and lean into that. And many times, like, I look at our ratios. It's about one third or, like, no. I don't feel comfortable dropping the name, but you should reach out to them. And then two are like, yeah. Like, you could mention we spoke, but it's a mix of you could mention we spoke and also, like, send me an email all intro. Mostly, like, I'll mention we spoke. And then what we do is we actually leverage the referral sequence in Outreach that was created by Sam Nelson. That's one of the top performing sequences that Outreach ever created, and we use it. You know, you're talking 70% reply rates. Right? So the email might look to you, Armand, if I don't get you on the phone, might say, hey. Nick told me we should chat, and then just a very short email. So to your point, there's strategy around getting the referral. If not, can I mention that we spoke? If not, alright. I'll have to use that information when we get connected. So this is super important to note because what you've done is you've created a pecking order of what you want out of your customer, and that's sort of the order in which you're asking for things. So your number one preference is I get Nick to introduce me to Armond. Right? That is your number one preference. But to your point, that's a lot of work. So what you're doing to minimize that work is you're saying, hey. I think I need to talk to Armond. Right? I'm making it as obvious as humanly possible who I need to talk to next. And if you can't get that, then what you're doing is you're saying, can I at least mention our name? And you have a sequence in your back pocket ready for when that happens. And then the final and last ditch effort is if they say, no, you cannot, you're probably baking that all the way back into your account research that you talked about in your first actionable takeaway, and you're using that in every single cold call that you have moving forward. Do I have that right? Yeah. I think the only thing to note is that we're still reaching out to you in this case, right, and Nick at the same time. And so, like, we definitely wanna target the ICP titles first, but we throw in the other mix so that if it so happens and the stars align that we end up talking to other people before that I see, that we've kind of built a groundswell. Sometimes there's cases where we talk to more than one person who both drop the same person's name. Right? And so we're able to have that. To your point, like, social proof wins usually in terms of getting into a conversation, But, ideally, they're just connecting with, you know, the director of recruiting in this example out of the gate. But this is just an additional this additional quivers that most teams don't do that could help you overcome the objections or get right into a business conversation. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. So, Terry, let's let's go through you've had this great conversation with the director of engineering. You've had this great conversation with an SDR. You mentioned this referral sequence. I've actually personally never seen big fan of Sam Nelson, but never seen his referral sequence before. You had a super interesting subject line that you mentioned. It was, Nick told me we should speak, right, which is pretty direct. What goes into that first email and then the follow-up touches in that referral sequence? So in this case, you know, it might be like, hey. I'm emailing you, Armand. Nick said we should talk. Hope all is well. Nick said we should talk. I'd love to show you what we're doing in Orem and why Nick passed me your name. Do you have time over the next few days? Here's a calendar link. It is surprising to see that, like, that email gets, you you know, roughly about a 15% reply rate, but because it lacks contacts, but many people then respond with asking for contacts, and sometimes it's just straight out straight booking time. And then next is, like, really just a phone call. You send a connection request. You have another call usually using a voice mail drop. And then the secondary email, which has, again, like, the secondary email, is just to reply to that first email. And it's just saying, hey. Just make sure you got my first email. I know it can fall through the cracks. How does your calendar look for a quick call During my conversation with Nick, and this is where this is automated. Typically, you put this research in ahead of time. You know, these were some of the things that we discussed. I have time, and then you put in your CTA. Well, what's really smart about this is where a lot of people salespeople screw things up is they talk to that director of engineering and they have that three and a half minute conversation, and they've got a bunch of notes. And now they know they're going to Armand and they send them the subject line, same as you. Nick said we should talk, but they think that they have to include every minutia piece of context from that first conversation. And the email ends up being like this massive wall of text, and you overwhelm the other person. All you are doing actually, you do have context. It's Nick said we should talk. And when you get them to reply, they are now opting into saying, wait. What really? What is this about? Which is much, much better than you including everything all at once. You're asking them to make just one decision, which is, okay. Do I, do I believe Nick is credible enough to, that I want to talk to someone that he said I should talk to? Armand, you might not always agree with the people I say you should talk with. You're not asking him to make two decision, which is evaluate Nick's credibility as a referrer of a, you should talk with the salesperson and the message. You're you're actually bisecting it into two different decisions. I want to ask you, Terry, about how you are positioning what you do. When you use that permission based opener and they say, alright, Terry, tell me why you called. How are you approaching that piece of that conversation? What do you say? Great question. So in case of Aurum, right, and they say, what do you do? I'll say, well, here, Aurum's a live conversation platform. We allow you to dial anywhere between, you know, two to sometimes up to 10 numbers at the same time, and we connect you with live prospects. So now your SDRs are going from having a few, you know, conversations today to having more conversations in one day than they typically would have in a week. And since you're leveraging Outreach, we have very tight integrations. We usually see a 50 to a 100% increase in the overall production of the SDR. I'll end by saying this to you, Arman, is that if you're hiring SDRs, the ability to two x your SDR production without having to, you know, add headcount is gonna really help your company save money and also save you a ton of time. So I'm curious. Do you have reps today that are driving revenue over the phone like I am today? You know, something along those lines. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. I'm curious, Terry. That's pretty different from what I've heard in terms of a call to action. A lot of times, what people do is they say, hey, I know I'm calling you out of the blue. Here's my thing, etcetera, etcetera. Could we get fifteen minutes so I can show you what this thing looks like next week? Right? I'm curious, why are you leading with a discovery question, which is, I'm curious. Do you have this problem, or do you have anyone that's similar to our situation a b c instead of just asking for the meeting flat out? Because they could be disqualified. They could not be a good account. They could say, actually, like, we're hiring one we only have one SDR that we're hiring for. And currently, like, I know you did your research on Outreach. We actually moved to, you know, Groove, which we don't integrate with yet. Right? If the SDR had booked that meeting for the AE, the AE would have been like, wait. Why didn't you qualify them at all? So I think we always jump into qualifying questions first, typically, because those questions, as as you notice, are more open ended, and then they can lead to business conversations. And that's gonna actually derive more pain so that we have, like, really good show rates and really good qualification rates. I think that question you ask is kind of cool because it's almost sort of like meta. It's like, I'm curious. Do you have other people that are driving revenue using the phone Like I am right now because it's hard for them to be like, well, cold calling doesn't work because like, if you're on the phone with them, clearly you've made that connection. What do you do when you call a sales leader? Who's like, well, we don't believe in cold calling when there's almost like a, a philosophical conflict. Do you like, do you try to convince them? Do you just say, alright, whatever, move on to the next person? Like, what's your take on how hard you will try to overcome, like, certain objections versus just cutting the cord and calling somebody else? Man, the number of VPs of sales or sales leaders that don't believe in cold calling, but their reps have a KPI of 80 to 100 dials a day is mind blowing. So the first thing I'd be able to step back with is understanding, like, what about cold calling do you not believe in? Right? Because there's a like, what you wanna do with the objection is is first empathize. Hey. I totally understand. Like, cold calling has fallen out of vogue. It's a very difficult thing to execute on, and not everyone sees value there. Like, what parts of the cold calling process? Right? So let's say and it could be any technology. What part of x process? Why, why reasoning? And get them to open up as to why they don't like it. And many times, what we find is, at least in the terms of Orem, is it's not that they don't believe in cold calling. It's that that cold calling without connects is a waste of time. So having the rep spend three to four hours making, you know, calls speak to no one is invaluable. But when I ask, well, hey. If your reps actually get connected to the target prospect and they've qualified them a little bit beforehand, like, do they have a good conversation? Do they book meetings? Yeah. We do. But, you know, I don't want them wasting time listening to the phone ring. So it's like, okay. So this is where Orem comes in, right, and I can objection handle. Now on the alternative, they're like, we don't believe in it at all, and our reps don't have any dial KPIs. Maybe they're making 10 to 20 dials a day. We are better suited going after organizations that already have a calling culture, and we can always come back to them, you know, later if they if things change. But that's where I would just I would honestly d q that person or the account. Terry, I wanna talk about objections, and I wanna talk about one that's sort of timely right now where I feel like a lot of SDRs and BDRs are getting hit with objections related to the economic environment where, like, you call a VP of sales and they might even have some interest, but they're like, hey. Like, right now budget's totally frozen. Like, I can't spend anything right now, so sorry. Not interested. How is your team responding to objections like that? So first of all, I'll give what the normal objection handle is. Right? Hey. We have no budget. Tough time. Usually, we say, hey. Totally understand budgets are constantly moving targets. This conversation is really about figuring out if there's a potential technical fit and if we can potentially achieve those outcomes for you. And do you have fifteen minutes to take a quick look? So the goal here is, like, we're not trying to sell you the technology. You don't have budget. But let's actually see whether or not you're a good fit. And then to take it a step further, especially for those that have a technology that requires all the best practices, you could always leverage the we'll share the best practices so that you understand how to build your foundation so that when it comes time to start putting things on the house, it doesn't crumble and that you're ready to take advantage of acceleration. You wanna be the person who actually knows what to do now so that they can execute later. Beautiful. Terry, we are running out of time, and so we gotta move ourselves to the final question. And so the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really good things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? If you have any sort of conversation or reply over email where you're gathering information, like putting that into the account notes or some sort of area where it's visible across the rest of the org. If all you see is f slash u in three months, that f slash u means something completely different to the person reading it. But I've seen reps even trip up on themselves. Calling, for example, let's say, you spoke to the director of engineering, get a good conversation, and then you call the director of recruiting, but you don't have your notes in front of you, that you spoke to so and so. You left on vacation. You came back. You forgot. You could have easily booked that meeting. So what I realized is that reps do this is a bad habit of not putting the notes that you had with a specific person at the account level so they can be referenced when you connect with other people. It's a mess at every organization. It's a it's a best practice that has to be, you know, really drilled in. Boom. You think you're gonna remember, but you probably won't. So take the eighteen seconds to put it in, and it'll pay dividends down the line. Terry, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Terry Hussein include, number one, call people one level down in the management chain to get intel on the people who are one level up. Number two, when you do, before you get off that call, ask for the referral to the right DM. First, try to get that referral, and if not, get permission to use their name. Number three, if that next person doesn't pick up the phone, send them an email with the subject line, Nick said we should speak. And then lastly, number four, take all of that intel that you get in addition to that account level research and the prospect level research and put it all in one page when you're dialing so you can constantly build your understanding of the account and use that as ammo in every cold call. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here? Let Terry know if you liked the episode. At the end, he said, guys, did I do a good job? And I said, I thought you did, but let's let the audience be the verdict. So if you enjoyed Terry's episode, send him a note on LinkedIn. Let him know, and we'll see you next week on the show.
