## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Frogg, and I'm here with my host, Mark Cusiglow. And today, we have someone who has been on the show multiple times. He is one of the baddest sales leaders I've ever met. He's been on both the sell show and the lead show. He's part of the Mark Cusiglow coaching hall of fame. It is Alex Kremer, who is the founder of Illuviance. And, folks, we have a very different, awesome, extremely important episode for you today. Marc, why should people listen? For those of you that don't know, Alex and I have probably worked together for five or six years. Alex is my culture guy. At Outreach, he helped me define the culture when we brought the office from remote into Seattle. He was the guy sent to New York City to see that office's culture, and he was the guy I brought with me to Catalyst when I wanted to change the call there. And his magic is he combines tactical sales skill stuff with the inner game. And today's episode is about the inner game, which is often neglected. Most people don't know how to do it, or they do it accidentally. And you're about to hear tactical ways to build culture inside your sales team. And, man, I think this one is like one of those that where, at first blush, you might be like, what is he talking about? But if you listen, I'm telling you, there's a lot of gold in there. Folks, if if you are struggling to connect with your reps, if you're struggling to motivate your reps, this is one way to reveal the human behind the sales leader. Let's roll. Three, two, one. On with the show. Alrighty, Alex. Welcome back to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. Tactic number one. Teach the main buckets of each part of your sales process. And we're actually gonna focus for this particular tactic on the initial meeting. So as opposed to just saying to a rep, hey, you need to do the initial meeting better. You actually can break it up into five different components. The first component is how are you framing the actual conversation, establishing your credibility, giving essentially the agenda there. The second bucket is the discovery that you're going into. How are they? Are they quantifying the problem, understand the executive priorities? The third bucket is, are you speaking to the trends or the challenges that the prospect is facing? Fourth bucket is how are you actually speaking to your product. And then the fifth is how are you booking next steps and getting other people involved. So essentially, five buckets within each part of the sales process. Love bucket based trainings. What do you got for number two? Alright. Number two is a little bit different. The biggest thing that I am seeing from sales reps today is a lack of passion. And one of the best ways to actually activate passion within your sales team is actually getting their prefrontal cortex. We're getting a little science based here. Their prefrontal cortex involved. And the way that you actually do that is you make people feel like they belong, like they're part of something more than themselves that just activates a certain sense of flow within them. So there's a practice that I call the four h's. This is a really tactical thing you can bring to your sales team to make them actually get to know each other and feel like a bunch of people who are on a team, not just a bunch of individual contributors supporting each other. And so the four h's are what is your history? Who is your hero? What is a heartbreak you've experienced as well as what is your hope for the future? So it's a really powerful frame to support a really deep and powerful conversation. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. I know we're gonna dive deeper on that, but first, bring it on number three. Number three is who is your first mate? As a leader, it can feel extremely lonely and you need somebody who has your back. And that does not mean another leader or your manager or whoever it means actually somebody on your team. If you can't make a forecast call, who from your team who's a rep is going to be able to fill in for you? If you have a new rep on your team, who is the senior rep who's going to support them? Right? This is also somebody that we need to need to share something with the team. That might be a little bit of a heavy topic. You're prepping them ahead of time so they can come in and support you on the change that's actually happening. This is also something you're going to invest a little bit more time in but it makes it so you're not by yourself. You got your first mate as you're driving the ship. Alright, Alex. Listen. I think we do a lot on the buckets and the the training, and we can maybe get to that. Where where I wanna start is where I've seen your magic. Alex and I went to Catalyst together to help turn around their GTM stuff. And listen, there's a couple different kinds of leaders. There's the leader that is really business oriented, super into the numbers, knows how to do that kind of stuff. That's a great skill to have. Then there's the people leader, the the one that I'll run through a brick wall, might not know where I'm gonna end up with quota this month, but it doesn't matter because I'll figure it out because that's my job, and I'm gonna do it for this person. Right? And that's where I've seen Alex's magic. And I'd love to talk about this four h thing first. Right? Because you talk about passion. Define passion for me because I think a lot of people could take it a lot of different ways. And why is it important? Passion to me is this feeling of alive. It's this feeling of what you are doing actually matters, and you're starting to come from a certain vibration or transmission that what you are doing actually matters. I'm all about teaching the sales tactic and strategy, right? The the seven step process to quantifying the pain in a discovery process is extremely important. But there also has to be that underlying foundation that's built upon mental, emotional, even spiritual health. And specifically, it needs to come from passion. I don't care how good your cold call script sounds. If you're not coming from the right tonality, it's going to fall flat. And right now, I would say that the tech sales world is probably in one of the biggest inflection renaissance changing periods right now. It seems like everybody and their mother has a side gig of some sort. Seems like cultures are trying to change what they're doing, and there's just people are really questioning, like, what's going on here? Like, it's just not having what the same sting, so to speak, that it used to have back in 2018, 2020 time frame. What people want more than ever is they want meaning and they want community. And so what this four H exercise really does is it helps you say, yes, we have a larger goal that we're trying to hit. We have this revenue number. We have this massive quota, whatever it might be. But I want to make it so that when I'm going after this big, hairy, audacious goal, I'm doing it with other people who know me intimately and who I also know. That I'm doing it and the byproduct of that is not just making a ton of money, it's also allowing us to feel like we're doing something that's meaningful. And also when I look at the people who I'm doing it with, man, they got my back, but most importantly, they freaking push me. They're holding me accountable here. And there's a very specific process in terms of how to actually conduct the four h exercise. But when we talk about passion and community and meaning, that's really where it comes from. That's what people are craving really more than ever. Yes. I see that too. I believe it. I've seen it in action. What happens even when times are great when you activate this extra gear with passion. So let's go through the exercise specifically because I think a lot of leaders probably just agree with everything you said, and they're completely lost on what to do next. Alright? So first of all, question one. How do I know as a leader how much to open up about and how much to share? And where's the line where, alright, don't go that don't go any deeper. That's a powerful question. So first off, I just wanna take a step back. I learned this four h exercise from the the Browns football team back in like 2020. And this exercise is what brought them from like the dark ages it seems and essentially brought their team up to me like a a true team. But I I read this really powerful quote that said, power without vulnerability is unrelatable. And also vulnerability without power, it's kinda like, oh, that's a little bit disgusting there. Like, it repels me a little bit. So if you are in a state of power in order for people to be drawn to you, to trust you, to actually see, oh, this person gets me, you have to open up. Now you can't open up to the point where it breaks rapport and they no longer trust you and want to follow you. But my philosophy around leadership is they're looking for somebody who's not going to be leading from the stands. They're looking for someone who's on the field with them and who's willing to go far and also to recognize and acknowledge, hey, this shit is hard. Right? And it's also hard for me, but I'm still going for it. And I would just say even Mark, I've seen talks that you've given. I know some of the most empowered talks that I've given that actually even inspired my team is when I've really opened up and said, hey, this is this is hard. Like, I'm struggling right now, and I'm still saying yes even during the struggle. And what it actually creates is it creates like a dynamic form of leadership. And essentially, what you're allowing is your reps to lead. Right? The best leaders give other people the opportunity to lead. And when you can actually make it so that, hey, I'm open to receiving your feedback or even being seen or witnessed within it, you're just empowering your team to take on a whole new sense of, bravado, I guess you could say. Does it mean that you share your personal life? Or does it just mean that you share fears and and what makes you anxious? Give me some examples of depth that are appropriate and then maybe one that's inappropriate. I've shared a lot of very personal things with my team and even with the community that I lead now. I've shared when I've gone through breakups. I've shared when I got yelled at from my boss who was their skip level. I've also shared when I've just gone through deep bouts of depression and just, like, that's my mental health journey there. But I don't necessarily do it as, like, I'm helpless here. I do it as, hey, here's just the raw what's going on with me, but also here's what I'm doing and why I'm still saying yes. I'm still moving forward. I'm still believing in the vision with what we're going towards. Where I start to see it get a little bit, I'd call it leaky, is when the manager or the leader is sharing stuff that's actually causing people to doubt whether or not that manager or that leader is someone they should follow. Or another way say it, whether that person is enrolled still into the vision of the company, of the team, of the product, of whatever it is that they're doing. Right? So at the end of the day, if the leader is enrolled into the vision and the mission, guess what? The team is going to be able to feel that not just through their words, but through their transmission. But if the leader is doubting the mission, the vision of what they're actually doing, the reps are gonna say, my boss isn't even in. Why am I in? And then that just starts a tailwind and a domino effect of, we're going downhill from here. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. So I wanna get tactical on this meeting because I think it would be really helpful for leaders to know that, okay. This is the dream state of where I want to be, how I want my team to feel, and how I wanna get vulnerable with my team. Talk to me about how you actually facilitate this exercise. And then what would be helpful is to understand what are the types of things that you're hearing reps share. But then as a leader, what are the types of things that you're sharing to open up the door for your reps? So I'd almost break this up into four main components to actually implement the four h framework. The first part is the frame and then actually how you support the conversation amongst your team. First, it's about, hey, why is it important for us to be having this conversation? For example, even giving the frame of, hey, if you feel like you belong here, that's gonna activate your prefrontal cortex, which is gonna make you feel more passion. Automatically, people are now saying, oh, I should show up here. I should open up because that's actually going to give me more passion. Right? And then it's about actually creating the example or sharing authentically what this question really means to you. For example, if I share about the four H around your heartbreak, your hero, your hope, your history, I will give a few examples personally of things about how that applies myself I won't necessarily go too much into it, but I'll probably give an example of one that really resonates and actually, you can only take somebody as far or as deep as actually you've gone yourself. So this is really the opportunity to be like, Yeah, guys, we're going here. Like, I'm really letting us drop in here. So after you've set the frame, then it's about there's like a three step process. Before people share amongst each other, step one, put on some Vibe journal music and have them get out a pen and a journal and journal the answer to the question. Let that be about four to five minutes. Do not have them type here. There's something about when the thought is going down your brain, down your arm, into your hand, onto a pen, onto a journal that you actually start to understand it. You deepen it. And also when you type, you can think really fast. So when you're actually journaling, it causes you to slow down and you're visually seeing your thoughts really start to connect in terms of how do I feel you want to connect the emotions to it. After you've had people journal. Let's say you have a team of eight, you're actually going to break people into groups of two. So now as opposed to me sharing this really vulnerable thing amongst everybody in my team, I'm gonna share in a little bit more of a closer one on one type of container that just allows me to feel safer, right? It allows me to have kind of my first pass of expressing what I journaled. And then the step three is when you bring everybody all together. And you say, okay, guys, now's the opportunity to share. What did you hear from your partner? What felt true to yourself? What were some similarities that came through this? And essentially, you're wanting to just support a powerful conversation. And you don't need to respond to everything that everybody says. Just asking simple questions like, cool. Why does that matter? Who else does that impact? What would that mean for you? And also, if somebody shares, give other people the opportunity to say, does anybody want to witness or say what they appreciate about Joe's share right there? Right? And so essentially, what you're gonna find is after everybody shared, you're like, wow, you dropped almost the energy and the tonality of your team. And then you just see, man, I know people way closer. This is my crew now versus just a fellow sales rep on this so called sales team. So you set the frame. They journal on their own, then they share it one on one. They share it with their team. So you're slowly opening people up. And I wanna go all the way back to that first part where you set the frame, which is if you're sharing high level stuff, which is, I wanna make a lot of money this year. I'd like to make $200, $300, whatever it is. If you're sharing trivial stuff, they're gonna treat it like a trivial exercise as well. So could you give an example? And you could even share what you've shared in the past. What would an example be for history, hero, heartbreak, and hope that sets the right tone? So for history, I'll apply this to myself. I'll share about when I was at Microsoft, and I was the number one account executive at Microsoft for the third year in a row. And on paper, while I was making more money than I'd ever done and I was looking really good on the inside, I was really dealing with a deep place of depression. So much so that I was bedridden for three weeks. I ended up having to move back from San Francisco back to Seattle and to live close with my family. But what that journey really taught me is the importance of self connection. I'm all about having great results and achieving and making a shit ton of money, all that sort of good stuff. But first, I need to make sure that I'm feeling good. I can't do all that at the expense of my mental health. And you notice how I'm, like, sharing something vulnerable there, and I'm also tying that into, I can even tie that into my hope. Right? So my hope based on my history is that, hey. We're here to learn the tactics and the strategies and the skills that's necessary to achieve an extremely high level, but we don't sacrifice who we really are or lose ourselves on it or burnout and stress and scarcity and all this sort of stuff that comes along with sales. We talk about that because I know just from being in your guys shoes how important that really is. And I've talked a lot about heartbreak. I think people don't talk enough from my perspective. It depends on who the leader is about the stuff that you got hurt by. And that doesn't just mean romantic relationships. This could be like, hey, my mom had cancer. That was really hard for my family. I've shared that in in the past. Or, hey. I got fired from a previous job, and it broke my freaking heart because I cared so much about that company. It gave everything I had. So it's like we're going one or two layers deeper than maybe you would see on the facade. And if one of your reps is just saying, hey, my hope is to make $500,000 It's that classic question of saying, cool. Why does that matter? What will that allow you to do by making $500,000 one step further? What I love is is the way you set the tone. I'm so glad you went there because when I saw the buckets of history, hero, heartbreak, hope, they're all different levels to that, how much you're willing to share. The moment you went into your story around being the number one Microsoft rep, but actually being miserable behind the scenes, it actually provoked all of these memories of everyone thought that I was the top dog at Pave making VP at 29. But behind the scenes, I was more miserable than I had ever been in my entire life. And when you open that up as a leader and you show that you're human, what happens is everyone else feels, quote, unquote, what the Gen z's call, seen. Right? That's the definition of feeling seen is when someone is going through something similar to what you're going through, And these buckets allow you to hit on multiple emotional notes with your reps, and they humanize you. And so I just wanted to share that because just by you doing that, it brought a lot of memories out of me that I would naturally wanna share in that kind of environment. And I wouldn't have done that if you hadn't set those examples yourself first. People have a lot of emotions, whether it be anger, sadness, fear, insecurity, whatever it might be. And so often as sales reps or even as sales leaders, we push it down and we put on this face of I'm great. I'm always great. Isn't selling this product amazing? Isn't whatever it might be? And it's like we become out of rapport with ourselves and also it's just whether prospects realize it whether your team realize it like they feel it. Like it's just like a little bit like just putting on this show when we all know that there's something else under here. And really what it is is these emotions that you feel if you keep them buried, they start to fester. They start to get like all clogged up in there. They become something that it's not and then you you start to put on this armor and then nobody actually can really connect with you. And so really just by being able to share it amongst your team, you're liberating the energy. It's what I like to say. It's what's coming is going. It's coming up to actually move through you here. And here's the thing just to bring it back into sales. It will actually help you sell better. It will actually allow you to connect with your prospects better. Your tonality will come more from your stomach versus from your your your head or your your neck or your chest because you're you're not quite sure you're trying to put on this like fake mask thing. But when you're actually connected with yourself and you're speaking from that place, you trust yourself. Therefore, other people are going to trust you. And it's scary as hell to share this stuff with your team. But I think people now more than ever are wanting that because by, Mark, by you doing that, it's giving permission all the time to everybody else here. Like, hey, we're real here. What's up? Yeah. Let's crush quota and I care about you. I want you to feel good. It's gonna help your retention at the end of the day. Dude, those things are very interrelated. You can't be afraid to look your reps in the eye and tell them that they need to work a little bit harder. And, Mark, you and I have talked about how a lot of people are like, no activity expectations, and there's this, like, oversofting of the world of sales. And then they assume that because sometimes we wanna say, hey. You need to pick up the phone or you need to put in a little bit more work. People automatically assume that that's hustle culture, and it's not. What allows me to have those hard conversations with my reps is I can actually have those conversations best with the guys who've like, some of my reps on my team, they've literally seen me, like, crying in the corner before. And I can have those conversations where I can call out my reps on them not being best selves because I know who they are. And it's not just me saying you need to hit quota, so you need to do better. It's me saying, I know what you're capable of. I know where you wanna be. I know the type of person you told me you are. You told me all the ways that things that you were disappointed about, and I'm trying to call you out on how good I know you actually are versus the behaviors that you're representing today. And that's what allows you to look someone in the eye and be like, run through that brick wall, like Mark was saying earlier. And so if you want your team to work harder, you can put the commission plan in front of them. You can say that this is the important board goal for the company. But none of that stuff compares to you actually having a human connection with your reps and understanding what's important to them and letting them feel like there's a human that's rooting for another human independent of what happens in front of your w two. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, Alex. I think another cool framework that you do is Bud Thorn. You wanna explain that as another cool little way to do this kind of thing, another tactical way to create this kind of community on your own team? Bud Thorne, when I was leading a team, and it's even still to this day for people who I coach, there are two meetings that I'd have on our calendar every single week. One of which was an alignment meeting, which is, hey. This is your time. We could talk about a a big deal. You wanna be coached. You wanna talk, like, just do deeper dive, and then you have your pipeline one zero one. That's where we're really driving next steps on where all your deals are actually at. But in the alignment one zero one, they didn't have an agenda and I didn't really have anything that was necessary to bring or coach them on. It always be like, alright, rose by the dawn. Rose is essentially what are you blossoming at? What is going really well in your life right now? If you think of a rose on a beautiful sunshiny day right after there was a light sprinkle and that thing is just I am in all my glory right now. Look how beautiful this is in my life. Bud has the opportunity to turn into a rose, but it's not quite there yet. This is your growth opportunity. It still needs to be tended to. It still needs to be watered. Right? It's okay. What's an opportunity that we're really, really working on that you're excited about? That, man, if we really lean into this, that's gonna be that beautiful rose there. Thorn is if you prick if you touch it, you might prick your finger and bleed a little bit. I'm struggling here. This is where I'm feeling really challenged. Right? And why I really love it. It's like just through the art of asking the question. What always happens is the rep is let me think about that. And just simply through the inquiry of asking the question you're you're working on. It's not necessarily about getting to the answer or getting to the solution or fixing it or doubling down, whatever it might be. It's simply about let me ask the question and let me have you reflect. That in itself is all that's actually needed. Right? You're getting the juices flowing here, and it's simply bringing a greater sense of self awareness to the rep of, like, how am I doing right now versus just caught up in it. You're getting to know your team. You're understanding their goals on a personal level. And I know you've talked about this quadrant exercise as well as a way to turn these higher level who you are, your motivations, your aspirations into goals that you could actually start to chase after for different avenues of your life. And so talk to me. How do you start to turn these into tangible goals that allow you to motivate your team in different dimensions? I think it's pretty obvious that every sales leader and sales rep wants to crush their quota, make a shit ton of money, and make President's Club if possible. But how do we also recognize that there's so much more in your life that you can actually go about attaining? And so we do this thing called this quadrant exercise. And I would definitely do this at the very beginning of every single year. And oftentimes when I felt like my team needed to drop in a little bit more, hey, what are we really working towards? I'd actually do it at the very beginning of each quarter. And so four quadrants. The first quadrant is what is your work and your career goals? Are you trying to hit a certain number? Are you trying to get promoted? Are you trying to book x y z number of meetings? What is the key things that we're working towards in this avenue within your life? Are you trying to mentor people? That's a key thing here. But then the other three three is really about let's talk about the holistic perspective of your life. The second bucket is let's talk about what's your health goals. And your health goals can be your mental health. It could also be your physical health, your spiritual health, whatever it might be. What's the health that we're actually working on? The third bucket is your relationships, and your relationships could be your teammates. It could be your boss. It could be your romantic partner. Right? It could be the relationship that you have with yourself. What is the relationships you're wanting to work on? And the fourth bucket being is time, money, and freedom. How much time do you want to actually be spending working to hit your goals? How much spaciousness do you want in terms of freedom? What do you want your w two to say at the very end of this year here? So this is just a great kind of way of let's look holistically at what are we working towards. And oftentimes what I do is when we do QBR planning of let's talk about all your accounts and your strategies and all that sort of stuff. And also let's talk about what your four quadrants are. The team and even the leaders can actually see how to support you on there. And then again, it's just going that one layer deeper. It's not just a bunch of individual contributors who happen to be reporting the same new manager. This is a crew. This is a unit. I want you to look to your right and left like, these are my homies who know me and who I know deeply. Yep. So if a manager or a leader can't listen to this and hit all three right away, their team would think that they're nuts all of a sudden. Right? So if you were to pick one to start with, which one would you pick and and why to start to ease into this transition? I would say if there's an easy place for people to start, it's Rosebud Thorn. In your next one on one, it should be like, hey. I learned this really cool little frame for just really giving a self awareness where you're at. What's your what are you doing well at? Where's the option for growth? What are you struggling with here? And it just opens up the conversation of, this is a really powerful conversation. And I think the four quadrants and the four h's, I think is a little more team, a little bit more prep that goes into it. I would really recommend a couple things is one is Rosebudsthorn is about listening more than it is solving. Just listen. As Alex mentioned, the inquiry and the reflection is what's the exercise. And then secondly, if you're gonna start it, you need to do it. And so you need to become ready to share what your Rosebud and Thorn are as a leader in that. And that starts that okay. It's a balanced dialogue. It's not just the rep all the time telling my goals, my fears, my things. The the leader's also sharing those things, and that starts to create some momentum to get into deeper things and team exercises where everybody's, like, a little bit more oriented to, oh, I I know what we're doing here. This is familiar for me. Bingo. Alex, awesome episode. Really different episode, but I think it's super important topic. We have to talk about one last thing, the final question. We talked about all these good habits. What is one bad habit that every sales leader should break to make all the teams better? The one bad habit is not doing the work yourself. How many leaders have said, do as I say, not as I do? And it pisses me the freak off. You need to also show up. You need to share authentically. You also need to make sure that you're hitting the key things that you're driving for as well. If you are not doing it, how can you even expect your team to believe in you and to trust you? Boom. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Alrighty, Mark. It is time for a two by two recap from this episode with Alex Kremer. What do you have for your two? Yeah. Two by two. Number one is activating the prefrontal cortex with a sense of belonging makes people passionate. And passion is what something that the best sales reps all have. It's hard to activate passion if you don't feel like you belong because your prefrontal cortex isn't engaged. Number two is don't start this exercise with a group. Start it with one on one with rose, bud, thorn with a specific individual, so you're not throwing eight, nine, 10 people into a situation that's completely four. Warm them up individually before you go to the team stuff. Number three. One exercise that I really liked was the four h's, and this really helped Alex reveal just the person he was behind the sales leader. The four h's are tell something about your history, tell something about a hero in your life, say something about a heartbreak you've had, and then say something about hope. History, hero, heartbreak, and then hope. And then lastly, number four, the way you can actually administer that exercise is step one, set the frame and do it yourself. Step two, have your reps journal it on their own so they really think through this stuff. Step three, share it one on one with another rep on the team so that doesn't feel like they're sharing with the entire room all at once. And then finally bring the whole group together to share it all together. Folks, if you like this episode, I have wanted for the longest time to go to one of Alex Kremer's immersions where he takes people to these amazing places. He does meditations, ice baths, and he does all this inner game work, and his next one is in Costa Rica. You can check out a link to that down on the show notes, and you can even schedule a time with someone from Alex's team, and they will tell you everything you need to know about what you can expect from these immersions. So, folks, if you like this one, we will also include a couple of other links to Alex's other performances or shows on 30 to presidents club, and I definitely recommend you watch those too. Hang on for the next one. We will catch you on the next episode of the show. Peace.
