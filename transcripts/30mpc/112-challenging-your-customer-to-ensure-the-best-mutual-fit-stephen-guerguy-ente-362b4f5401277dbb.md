## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Frogg. I'm here with my co host, Nick Czygalski. And today, you know what? At at my company, Pave, I work with a couple people from a company called Segment. And every single time this man's name is mentioned, everyone says he is a sales legend. And today, we figured out why. It's the one and only Steven Gurgi, one of the first sales reps ever at Segment and now one of the first sales reps over at Monte Carlo. Nick, why should people listen? You can throw all of the tips and tactics and strategies at a customer possible, but if you don't have the guts to challenge them and challenge them throughout every element of the sales process, you're never going to be the best of the best of the best. And Steven is one of those guys who legitimately challenges the customer from the first call to the last call. And if you wanna learn how to actually bring it and challenge your customer, Steven's a guy to listen to. Three, two, one. I challenge you to listen to this episode. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, Us, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Steven. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Yeah. Totally. Thanks for having me. So the first is do deeper discovery. So really drive into the granularity of the business impact that your software or your product, whatever it is, might be solving. And then really just understanding their time frame, their pain, their goals. I think that's pretty paramount because it'll actually allow you to focus, which is my my second takeaway for the day. Well, let's hear it. What's number two? Yeah. Number two is focus. So I've been in software sales for about ten years, and the pattern that I've seen with the highest performing reps, the folks that do two to 500% of their number compared to the folks that do 80 to a 180% of their number is really that they focus on the right deals that are the highest likelihood to close with the largest ASP. I think it's super important, and and we'll talk a little bit about, like, timing and how how important timing is from, like, a focus and a prioritization perspective. Beautiful. Round us out. What's number three, Steven? Being more of a partner and an equal rather than a concierge. So as salespeople, you know, it's easy to think like, oh, if I close a steal, I get this dollar commission, or I really need to do everything I can to make this as easy as possible. But I really like to introduce good tension and negative pressure if I start to see the deal going sideways or if it starts going into the direction of my competitor. So we'll talk a little bit about kind of not necessarily being as helpful as possible, like a hotel concierge, but being perceived as a partner. So that way, like, the leverage ratio is much more equal than a very unequal, like, seesaw. Steven, I know you've been at multiple companies in the early stages where you're winning on vision. But the reality is you're an earlier stage product, and so there are probably some check the box features that you don't have that are sort of ticky tacky thorns in the side. So how do you go about getting customers to be aligned with the vision, but okay with the fact that they're going to have to compromise on some of the perceived table stakes features that some of the old guard competitors have? So oftentimes, I'll try through discovery to understand the the value or the prioritization of that specific feature set. So if they need let's just say I'm selling a BI tool. If they need, like, nontechnical users to be able to use it without having to write SQL and they're using Tableau, then that's something I'd be like, hey. How important is that to you folks? Or it seems like you're the data team, so you all know how to write SQL. So maybe that's not a huge priority. So I'll try to understand the prioritization of, like, certain features and functionality. I'll also use it as an opportunity to plant landmines around my competitors. So that way, when they go through the scoping exercise of, like, success criteria, what we need to see out of a a vendor or solution, I will insert things that we do very well that our competitors might not do well, and then I'll try to see or drive home the importance or the value of that specific feature that allows us to be in a better position. So for example, at my current company today, a lot of our competitors aren't SOC two type two compliant. So I'll ask a prospect or a customer, hey. So I noticed that SOC two type two compliance isn't on here or single sign on. I would assume because you're a fintech company, or I would assume because you're a bank, or I would assume because you're a a retailer like Nordstrom that that's really important to you folks. So is that part of the success criteria? And now I've, like, reframed the conversation around my software as well as what we do probably better than the competition. One area that I sort of struggle where it's like Arman, you asked that question about you don't have the table stakes might appear to be the table stakes features, and you're trying to sell Envision is when you get stuck talking to somebody who's far below the line. Because if I'm talking to somebody who's above the line and they get the vision, like, they're like, alright. Whatever. We'll deal without having that other stuff. But if I'm talking to, like, an analyst level person, they just need to make sure we're getting something with all of the boxes on their Excel sheet done. And so one of the things you talk about is not chasing deals that, like, aren't actually deals. What do I do in a scenario where I've got a company where I'm like, wow. This could be a great fit, and I know we would be a really good fit for this company based on what I know. But I'm stuck talking to someone who won't ever get the vision and is only focused on, like, this check the box thing. How do I handle that? Yeah. I think we've all been in in kind of, like, RFIs or RFPs where they're like, I don't wanna talk to you. Fill out this doc. Let us know if you're a vendor that can satisfy our needs or not. And it's usually run by a lower level engineering or or analytical org. Oftentimes, in preparation for this call, I'll try to have a a fairly good guess of who the economic buyer is. And so that could be, in my case, a director of engineering, VP of engineering, a CTO. And if it's, like, a smaller org, it's probably the CTO. So oftentimes, during that initial call, I might be like, hey. So I noticed your CTO, Mary, joined about six months ago. Is this on her radar? Is this a priority for her this quarter? Is it a next quarter priority? And try to understand if there is an economic buyer that's even involved or aware of this project. Because if they are, then it's a higher priority. If it's not, then it's a lower level priority. And if you can't get past as, like, low level gatekeeper, sometimes you just have to pursue the RFI or RFP because that's your only option. Candidly, we don't run trials at any of the companies that I've worked at. We run proof of concepts. In order to run a proof of concept, it requires resourcing both from a technology as well as a personnel perspective. So we dedicate sales engineering folks. We get you chatting with our product team. We get you chatting with our customer success organization so that way you have a pulse on what it would be like as a future customer of ours. And so it's a it's a fairly heavy lift on our end from a resourcing perspective. Our CEO does request to meet with prospects because, one, it obviously helps the internal selling a little bit easier. And two, it gives your CTO or CEO, whoever's bridging with ours, a lot of influence around whether it's pricing or product road map. So it ends up being a win win. We know that you're much more serious, and then you have access to your executives. And if you're serious about the software or the solution, then, again, nine times out of 10, the prospect's like, okay. That makes sense. I would love to have influencer or leverage on pricing or product roadmap features. So, Steven, this happens a lot in early stage selling where people are just so hungry for free trials because it's newer, there aren't a million case studies, they don't have a thousand other friends that are using the same software. And to your point, it's a massive suck on resources. But also you can have these runaway POCs or these runaway trials that go on forever. And so I'm curious, how do you talk people off the ledge when they are so insistent on getting some sort of free trial then? So I think of trials as fundamentally different from a POC. A trial is like, hey. Sign up with your credit card. It's like Dropbox. Like, add some files, use it. It's very self-service. And that's really common with, like, product led growth companies. That's a little bit different. A proof of concept, what I'll do is I will actually ask customers when we're going through success criteria, hey. So if we check all these boxes, are you gonna buy this? And it creates this, like, tension, and it creates a little bit of, like, pressure on them. And, you know, four out of five times, they'll say, yeah. If you guys check all these boxes, then I'll totally buy it. It's like, okay. And then so is it your budget, or is it your CTO Mary's budget? And I'll do deeper discovery around that. But if they react in a negative way of, like, no. I'm not gonna buy it. I need to make sure that, like, this is, you know, the right solution. We're looking at four different other solutions. And and, no, I'm I'm not gonna do that. I can't commit to that. Ultimately, I'll I'll try to approach it through, like, a lot of, like, empathy and try to be like, hey, man. So here's the challenge that we're facing. These POCs do require resourcing for us. It's not like a self-service credit card, and and here's the reasons why. That's why we do ask for this executive level access, and that's why we ask for you to kind of, like, commit because we wanna make sure that it's a priority for you. And if it is, we will throw everything we possibly can to make you guys successful. And, again, if they're not serious of, like, hey. Maybe the time that's a lot of lift right now. We're not ready to commit to that. And a lot of the times, like, they don't end up purchasing software. And I'm I'm happy to let my competitors spend their time chasing those POCs that end up never closing or their scope creep or if it's not a huge priority or pain, then it just gets whittled down on price because they're like, do we really need it? Is it really worth 6 figures? Why don't we just see if we can get it for 2 k a month? If not, we'll just pick it up when it's on fire. Because they have, like, a million other initiatives and priorities that they have to worry about. And if you're not a top priority, then you're just wasting your time. So, Steven, I love this concept of being okay with losing the wrong deals. Now there are times where there's a deal that's just within your fingertips and an early stage selling. Maybe you wanna bring in your CTO or your CEO, or oftentimes, you're working with product really closely as well. And so when you're close and you know you've got most of the things you need, but you need to bridge the gap on a couple of feature gaps, maybe not even today, but yet at least need a little bit of help selling the vision, I'm curious, how are you leveraging other teams internally in your sales process when you're in one of those competitive head to heads? In every single deal. Usually, people wanna talk to product and engineering. So either my CTO, my head of engineering, or or, like, head of product or a PM is involved in the deal. So part of our process is we have that product road map. But if it's, like, a highly technical organization or company, like, Stripe is a good example. They wanna talk to your CTO, and and they're probably gonna get access to the CTO. But if it's, like, a large enterprise and it's, like, a product driven org like JPMorgan Chase, they probably wanna talk to our product lead around, like, what's coming around the pike. So I involve my executives, especially on the EPD side, in every single deal. So that's part of it. The other thing that I'll do is I'll get prospects to talk to customers that have run similar evaluations, oftentimes have the same stack. And and then I prescribe it. I say, hey. Listen. What we found over the you know, god, we've done hundreds of these at this point. It's really helpful to talk to a customer who's actually gone through the process, gotten our software deployed, and has been successful. Especially if you're selling against startups, then that's, like, a huge advantage that you might have because maybe your competitors don't have as many customers that have been using it for six, twelve, eighteen months. So not only do I get a technical leader within our organization to talk to the prospect, I'll also get a a customer. But, again, for those gives, I have to have gets in return. Are you gonna buy the software if we check all these boxes? What happens if we don't check a few of these boxes in the POC? What if we're unable you said that SOC two type two compliance is really important to you. We don't have that yet. Are you gonna get to the conclusion where if you check all these other boxes, are you gonna buy it? Are you not gonna buy it? Because we can't just get that done in two weeks like a POC. So that's typically what I'll I'll do. So let's assume that you've gotten some gets, so to speak, and you have their commitment that if you derisk these three or four things, then, yes, I will in fact move forward and buy. Now when you bring in your CTO or when you bring in your PM, what have you, my guess is you're prepping them because they're not gonna just come in and give the same boilerplate, here's the road map. Right? You're probably having them come in to derisk certain things. So I'm curious, what goes into prepping a PM to make sure that that call goes effectively? Yeah. So if you're not building a prep doc, then you're doing it wrong. So every single call that I have either a PM or or a executive on, I have a fully built out prep doc. Easiest way to think of it is, like, who, what, when, where, why, how. So who are we talking to? What do they care about? How are we doing it? And then oftentimes, I'll include gaps. And I'll be like, hey. Here are the gaps that we have in comparison to our competitor or the incumbent solution. Here are the things to completely avoid, and here are the things to just, like, nail and, like, dive super deep on because they'll get super fired up about it. So in those prep docs, it'll have, like, high level, but then don't touch this, double down on this as well. Awesome. Is this more of a when you go into this meeting with product, are the product team members typically doing some sort of discovery, or is it more of a presentation type of format? It depends on the type of call. So sometimes it's a road map session, and then they'll say, hey. Our understanding we like to start with our understanding of how you're thinking about using our technology and what you're excited about kind of coming around the pike in the next few quarters. Is that your understanding as well? Do you agree with that? What's missing? And that's more of a presentation. If it's, like, a specific feature or aspect of our technology like, today, I work for a company that has a machine learning component in its software. And so sometimes they're like, hey. I just wanna understand how your models are built and, like, really dive into the weeds on, like, the machine learning models and the pattern recognition and the type of simulations that we run against their data. And so that's usually like a product or a technical leader that doesn't have slides unless they're selling the future and and what's coming in the future. It's really just more of a a phone or, in this case, a Zoom conversation. Gotcha. And I know you joined both Segment and Monte Carlo, two phenomenal orgs, very early on. And I joined Pay very early as well. And one of the challenges that I had is I explicitly remember losing three deals in the month, and the prospects each said the exact same thing. They're all like, the vision is awesome. I just can't tell how much of it is there yet. Right? And I felt like I had oversold the vision or oversold all the things that we want to do eventually, and it almost made it seem like these are all the things that we wanna do eventually. And it made the vision seem so big, but where we are today seems so small. And so I'm curious, how do you strike the balance between selling the dream and all the things that are gonna come in the future versus being like, hey. These are the problems that we're we're actually gonna solve for you guys today. Yeah. So you're gonna have a pulse throughout the entire sales process. How much of it is, like, what you do today and how much of it you're, like, selling ahead of the product? I would say a good rough number mentally is, like, we should be able to do 80% of this stuff today. And the other 20%, they're like, okay. We're willing to, like, take a bet. We're betting on you as a company, and we think you have, like, great product and engineering resources. So, like, we think we you can deliver. But if you find that, like, one out of two things that they want or it's a required capability or it's a preference is something that you don't do, but it's coming down the pike either next month or next quarter, then, yeah, you're in a pretty disadvantageous position, and you might not be able to win that deal. So I like to to hit that head on and and run towards that one. It's like, hey. I know that, like, we can only do about 50% of the stuff that you wanna do. Does this still make sense to do a POC? Like, does it still make sense to ask for your time? I wanna be super respectful of your time. Like, seems like we're just not there yet. And allow them to either, a, stop the eval now and save your time and theirs because you're not gonna win it. Or, b, they'll actually start selling you on why you are uniquely positioned. Oh, hey. Listen. Like, it's not a big deal. We're looking for, like, who has the product today and also a vision that aligns with our vision. And so your competitor's vision might not align with theirs. So I I like to introduce that tension and and ask them to kind of explain if it still makes sense. So the scenario you just described is one where you're you're saying, hey. We might not be a fit because of where we are right now. Yeah. How about the inverse of that where you're talking with a customer and one of the things you put in the prep doc is, like, the importance of, is this an initiative, like, right now this quarter versus two, three, four, maybe even next quarter out? Like, what do you do when you've got a prospect who seems like maybe they're sort of tire kicking or, like, this is a problem for, like, a lower level person, but it might not be an org level thing. How do you artfully, like, eject someone or or or push back on, hey. Maybe we shouldn't be showing you a demo right now. Yeah. So I'll just kind of run towards that one. I call it blowing it up. I'll just blow up the deal. I was just like, hey. So I'm a little bit confused. It sounds like this is probably more of a q three initiative. So can you help me, like, walk backwards and and understand the timeline here? Like, what are you folks thinking about? Like, do you wanna make an evaluation decision on, like, which vendors to do a proof of concept? If it's a company like PetSmart where they're just, like, big and slow, then they might need nine months to run this process. But oftentimes, if it's like, yeah. I'm just kicking tires trying to figure it out. Probably gonna make a decision by the end of the year where we're in a code freeze because we're in retail. They'll be like, hey. Totally makes sense. Honestly, like, as a company, we didn't even exist two years ago. So why don't I do this? Why don't I reconnect with you in about four or five months? And that way, we're gonna have, like, a ton of different stuff within the platform, and it'll be a little bit more of an applicable demo. And allow them to either, a, say, no. I need to understand what the vendor does now so I can start this process in which then maybe they're that's a good litmus test. Or, b, they're like, okay. That makes sense. What are things you're looking for? So you sort of gave that one example where they're like, oh, yeah. End of the year. We're gonna code freeze. But one of the things that keeps me from doing what you just described is the fear that I'm gonna reject them and they're gonna they're gonna get off the call and and then they end up buying from my competitor or they go way deeper with my competitor. And so when I finally do connect five months later, it's like, we're so far behind. We have no chance of catching up. So, like, what are some of the cues or triggers or things you're listening and looking for to help in inform your action in that scenario? So I'll preface by this is really hard. So I try to kind of understand, like, hey. Around timeline and priority, I try to ask it in a way that doesn't make them feel like I'm rejecting them. So oftentimes, we'll say, like, hey. Typically, what we've seen is that, like, proof of concepts take about two to three weeks, and then the customer ends up making a decision. Can you help me understand your time frame and, like, what you have in mind? And, like, oh, wow. That's a little bit different from what we see. Like, can you help me understand why that is? Oh, it's a six month process. The thing around, like, the fear of, like, oh my god. What if I blow this one up and my competitor gets it? Oftentimes, I find that that fear is the thing that's driving salespeople to pursue the wrong deals. Because they're like, I'm worried about my quota. I'm worried about my pipeline. I'm worried about losing this deal. I'm worried about losing it to this specific competitor, three competitors in a row. And so that fear always drives the wrong behavior. And so you should always be operating from a place of of confidence or at least try to. Well, so much of what you're doing, it seems, relates to time line. I've heard you talk about time line more than almost any other salesperson that we've interviewed on this show. And I'm wondering, when I think about the discovery process with a customer, like, I'm hoping to understand, like, the pain that they want to solve and the results they're looking to achieve. And then eventually, I wanna learn about, like, what's the buying process look like? And then I also wanna learn about the timeline. And I think about, like, you've got buying process and you've got, like, the business pain or need, and they're almost like two separate discovery tracks. I mean, they intertwine in ways. I usually prioritize understanding, like, what's the issue today? What can we solve? Before I start talking about, like, deal mechanics, like, time line, but it sounds like you might be talking about time line first or process first, and I'm wondering if you can just elaborate on that. Yeah. So my bias is coming from a place where I work in software sales where there is a fair amount of inbound interest, where a 100% of the business isn't isn't run by outbound. And so much like life in general, your most precious asset as a salesperson is time. And so I try to understand that timing as much as humanly possible early on in the process because I forget the statistic, but something like 80% of the sales process is done by the time the prospect calls you or talks to you. Right? They've looked at your vendors. They've looked at g two crowd. They've looked at Gartner and and Forrester and all that stuff. So they already have a pretty good pulse. They're pretty far along in the process. And if the timing isn't like a this quarter initiative, then it's just probably not high enough of a priority unless it's a large, large enterprise company like a JPMorgan or a Procter and Gamble where they're used to twelve to twenty four month sales cycles. But, yeah, I I think startups kind of live and die by timing and chasing the right deals that matter that have a higher likelihood of closing quickly versus chasing the wrong deals that don't matter or unlikely to close quickly. So that's why with pain, I think timing is probably the most important that I'll dig into around, like, a first call. It's like, help me understand the pain. What are you trying to solve from a goals perspective? And then, ultimately, why now versus why six months from now or why next June? One of the things that can be challenging is, let's say that they've identified that this is a priority at the end of this quarter, three months down the road, what have you. Great. You can start to walk back the implementation timeline. But still, sometimes if there's not a commercial lever and you don't wanna give up a discount, the difference for them between getting it done at the end of this month versus at the beginning of next month might just be one week, and it's not that big of a deal for them. So in a world in which you are not giving any discounts or commercial concessions, how do you hold people to very specific timelines to make sure that your month or your quarter doesn't get blown up? Yeah. So I'll try to figure this out as early as possible in the process to understand, is there a real natural internal compelling event? If I'm selling analytics and their contract expires with the incumbent on June 30, then they need something in place by, like, maybe June 1 to do the migration. So that makes sense. It's amazing when customers have internal compelling events. I'd say now four out of five times, customers don't have internal compelling events. And so to your point, the difference between them signing on June 30 or July 1 might not matter to them, but it could be the world of difference to a salesperson or a sales organization. So I'll try to understand that potential landmine early on, and then I'll kind of build my behavior around it. So, okay, if we're optimizing for a June 30 close date, then what do we need to do with procurement and legal to to work towards that? And you can start introducing carrots in the sales process. Like, hey. I know that you're doing us a favor around, like, this June 30 signature date, and it's important to you folks. But to sweeten the deal, what we'll do is maybe a free month of service, or we'll bake in, like, a discount that's contingent on that. And so you can start with really carrots rather than sticks around like, hey. Your price is going up if you don't get it done by June 30. That just never goes well, and it creates a really bad experience. So I'll try to understand if this is going to be an issue. And then, ultimately, if you have a strong champion, then you can ask them. Hey. It would be really important if you got this done for us. And I've been in countless negotiations where we do, like, three routes of, like, we start with this, and then we get whittled down to this, and then they want this. And so we get, like, version three or version four. Throughout all of those versions, I make sure that, like, the slides or the deck or whatever we're showing them is contingent on, like, a signed date. And then I constantly remind them, hey. Again, so just to make sure we're aligned, we're working towards this June 30 close. And then I ask them, like, hey. Do you see a world in which this doesn't get done by June 30? Like, do you know if your general counsel what who is the signer? And then I go into, like, the paper process. It's like, who's the signer? What's the procurement process? Is there a PO that needs to be issued? Is a PO issued need to get issued before? The signature after the signature, some companies have to issue a PO before. Who's on vacation that week? Who's taking their kids to Disneyland for spring break? All of that stuff is really important. But at that point in the sales process, hopefully, you have a strong enough champion that's gonna be selling in your behalf internally and and trying to give you that personal win. Alright, Steven. This has been great. We're running out of time, so we gotta move to the final question, which is we've talked about a lot of great things salespeople should be doing. Now we need to flip it on its head and talk about a shouldn't. And so the final question is what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? I hate to sound like your first VP of sales or sales manager, but, honestly, I think the number one thing that salespeople get too comfortable and don't do, and it just works against them in every single deal and interaction, is prep. If you're not prepping for every single one of your calls, you're gonna, like, miss out on an opportunity. So earlier in the process, we talked about, like, Mary being the CTO. You don't know who the CTO is if you don't do the prep. You don't know if Mary is six months in or six years into the role. You don't know if she's, like, just new to the organization. You don't know if she's gonna be the economic buyer someone else is gonna be. You haven't talked to any of potentially your technology partners. Like, if I'm in the data ecosystem, I might call folks at Fivetran or Snowflake or or Hightouch and say, like, hey. Have you sold to this company before? What was that process like? If you're not doing that prep, even just reading about their stock price plummeting two weeks prior, that's super important. And when salespeople get comfortable in their own rhythm and they're, like, confident and they're crushing it and they're doing well, it's probably the easiest thing that they forget to do, and it's it's super important. Beautiful. Steven, thank you so much for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Steven Gurgi include, number one, if it's not a fit, that's okay. Put it out there. If you only meet 50 of the requirements, put that out there, and then let the prospect justify themselves back into the deal. Number two. When you're going through any sort of RFP or if you're trying to understand all of their requirements, as you look through the requirements, what you need to do is you also need to say like, hey. Why isn't this in here? Why isn't SOC two in here? And what you wanna do is insert the areas that you do really well and your competitors don't do well, which brings us to number three, is once you get that RFP, don't just fill that thing out for free. What you should require is an executive level bridge where you bring in your CEO or your CTO in to meet with their VP of engineering or their CTO. Alright? And then lastly, number four. When you're going to drive timeline, your number one priority is an internal compelling event. If you cannot get an internal compelling event, your next best option is to walk back all of the things that you need to do around that June 30 deadline and then provide them carrots. That might be a free month. That might be a discount. Whatever it might be. But you should not be using the negative stick that says, hey. At the end of this month, your price is gonna go up. It never goes well. Alright, Nick. How can people help us out?
