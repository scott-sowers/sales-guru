## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to the President's Club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my coach, Nick Sigelski, And we are here in studio with someone who has been on our show multiple times. He is Alex Kremer. He was a director of sales at Outreach and was there super early on in the early days. He then joined Mark Cosgrove over at Catalyst where he was a head of sales and he helped build their function out zero to one. And today, he is the CEO over at Illuviance, and he is probably one of the best in the game that I've seen around building culture and developing reps. Nick, why should people listen? So one of the funny things that we've observed about 30 MPC, Armand, is we really, really focus guests on the tactics, how to make things practical. When in reality, what really moves a team more than anything else, frankly, is, like, the culture and the coaching. But the reality is most guests honestly have pretty fluffy stuff around that. And Alex gets really, really practical and usable around here are ways that you can build culture, change your team, coach people. He talks about things like getting permission to push your top performers. We talked about what happens if you need to change the dynamic between you and somebody on your team. You've been in a pattern for a certain period of time, how to call that out before you change the situation. We talk about on the spectrum of giving no feedback to giving too much feedback where you should fall for your different reps on your teams. If you are looking for an episode on how to build a rock solid sales culture for your team, this is one to listen to. Alrighty, Alex. Welcome back to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. Number one. It's all about how do you know when to challenge your team. If you ever seen the show, The Last Dance, the coach of Michael Jordan says something that will always stick with me. He said, the biggest respect you can give to the best player in the world, you push them hard. So how you do this at the very beginning of your relationship with any rep on your team, especially one who is a top performer, you have to set the tone of, hey. In this relationship, I think I can have the most impact on you and your earnings and your career as well as the most impact on this team if I push you. Are you open to a relationship in which I push and I challenge you? Once you get their permission to do that from that point forward, you're going to challenge them. Not because they're doing something necessarily bad, but because they got some freaking tall ass ceilings that they can grow into. Boom. What's number two? Number two. I like to call this dynamic leadership. Now so often, leaders think that they are at the top and the reps and the rest of their team are below them. How do we actually make it so you are shoulder to shoulder with your team? Essentially, you are on the team with them facing the challenge trying to slay the dragon with them. So for example, if your executive team is coming down hard on you saying, hey, your prospecting or your pipeline is terrible. How do you not go to your team and say, hey, guys. We got this big problem. You need to go about solving this. Increase your KPIs. How instead do you approach it and say, hey, guys. We have this opportunity in front of us. Some of you probably know how to prospect or build pipeline. I'm gonna name this better than me. I would love for all of us to figure out how do we do this together as a crew. Now, the unique part about this is you're actually having to be vulnerable and allowing other people to lead and other people to even lead you. Mhmm. This is a unique thing where you are no longer at the top. You are actually shoulder to shoulder with them. Amazing. Alex, bring it home. What's number three? Alright. Number three is how do you presence at the very beginning of every single team meeting? Now most reps most likely have been back to back throughout that entire day. And I bet you they got one or two or maybe eight meetings after Mhmm. That team meeting as well. People might be in a different state. So at the very beginning, three to five minutes, you need to have some sort of presencing exercise. That could be box breath. That could be Wim Hof. That could be a meditation. That could be a gratitude practice. That could be everybody stand up out of your chair and stretch. That could be everybody just name how are you feeling right now. It's a pattern interrupt. And when you actually have a pattern interrupt, it causes people to say, okay. We're here. I'm present. And, also, you know what? My team's a little bit different. And it kinda gives a little chip on your shoulder, like, we do things a little bit different. So it's not just the monotony of another team meeting. I think for a lot of sales leaders, frankly, it's kind of scary to be pushing Michael Jordan for two reasons. One, I'm worried that if I push Michael too hard, he's gonna be like, I don't wanna do this, and he leaps. And I'm dependent on that person to hit my number because they're my top performer. Or two, they might actually be a little bit better at selling than me. And I'm worried that I'm gonna expose myself or I feel like, is it even my right or place to be pushing them? So my question for you is, for folks that are scared of this or worried about this or haven't pushed top performers before, what are some of the biggest mistakes that you see sales leaders making that they should know to be looking out to avoid? Probably the biggest mistake, and I actually dealt with this a lot when I was at Outreach, was, there was a guy on my team, who's actually one of my really good friends. His name was Hank Wells. Hank was always fighting for the number one spot as an account executive at Outreach. And I had actually just moved from being an account executive to a sales manager. And it was just, like, based on how the teams were unfolding, I ended up being asked to be his leader. And I was terrified Mhmm. Because this was a guy who I was asking questions to, who I was getting perspective for on deal advice, and all of a sudden, I was being asked to coach him. Where I actually tended to was put my tail between my legs, and I focused on everybody else. Mhmm. And I said, Hank, just go and do your thing. As the top rep, he wanted to be pushed. He wanted to become even better. He wanted to become extraordinary. And the reason that I knew that is because I asked him, hey, brother. What do you really care about? Like, you're here. You're the top rep. Like, man, do you just wanna make a shit ton of money? Or what is it that you want? And what he told me is, like, dude, I'm trying to be literally the best sales rep that we have at this company and potentially any company I can ever go to. And once I knew that, I knew that it wasn't my job to necessarily tell him all the things that he was doing wrong or share all this wisdom that I had that he didn't necessarily have. Mhmm. What he was asking of me, whether through his words or whether what I knew was important to him, is for me to point out things or at least bring to his attention things that I was like, hey, is there an opportunity for you to be doing better discovery? Mhmm. I'm not saying I could have done better discovery than you. Although, you're being asked or you're wanting to become the most extraordinary sales rep we have. I think that your discovery was an eight there. You think it could be a 10. And it was just simply by me almost like putting the gauntlet down and challenging him. Hey. I think he could be better. Do you think you could? And it was like, especially when you have high achievers like that, like, they're going to, you know, answer the call. But the mistake that so many people make as sales leaders is they say, cool. I have about 50% of my team who are low performers. Mhmm. Let's focus on them. Let's try to make them at least achieve 70% of their quota. And then you got, you know, your top 20% of your team who's bringing in classic 80% of your revenue, who you like. They're good. But, actually, if you focused on them on moving from great to extraordinary, the ROI that you're gonna have on that is incredible. And I guarantee that when those top performers feel more in, more like, oh, man. I'm, like, I'm growing. I'm learning. That's a first domino effect that's gonna cause everybody else within the culture to say, oh, man. If Hank is in, I'm in. If this guy is open to being challenged, if this guy is growing, I'm open to be doing that as well. It starts a whole wave. In your experience, what are the top three to four places that you found it's most effective to push reps, and what are some of the areas that are better to let lie? The easiest ways that you can actually push people, I would say, I'd almost break it down into different types of buckets. When it comes to, like, tactics and strategies, that's always, you know, really you can get kinda caught in the minutiae of things with it. Yeah. But I almost break it down to, like, how are you going about prospecting and building pipeline? And that could also be, you know, hey. How you actually go about cold calling yourself or how you work with your SDR or just simply, like, are you generating pipe? The second part is how are you actually conducting these first meetings and getting them to be a qualified opportunity? The third part I would say is how are you then actually getting these qualified opportunities and moving these all the way to close? And the fourth part, you know, and this is, I think, the secret sauce here is, how are you developing these people to be leaders? Meaning, if you have a great rep on your team, the thing that will unlock your team more than anything is how do you change that person's identity from being an individual contributor to being a leader on the team. Because when you can actually develop other leaders, when you have a team meeting and they speak up, I guarantee the other reps are gonna listen to them a hell of a lot more than they're gonna listen to you because they have credibility. They're in the battlefield right alongside of them. Right? They're actually dealing with it. And so if you can instill this feeling of like, hey. I think your voice could be heard more with the newer people, with our executives, with me, and you can actually get them enrolled into the vision of that, you can kinda just sit back and facilitate really powerful conversation. But it's like, how do you make them a great sales professional in those different types of buckets? But, really, how do you push them to become a leader on the team? Let's just say you're out. Like, you as the leader can't make a forecast meeting. You can't talk to an executive or whatever it might be. Who's going to be the person that steps in on your behalf? And if you don't have a person that comes to your mind right away, that's a big telltale sign that you're not developing leaders. You need to have that person or maybe even two people you say, hey. When I'm out, I can rely on you to step in and be in that leadership, type of role. Sometimes, top performers, big egos, when you're running a sales training, they might be the first person if you bring in an external sales trainer to be like, I don't need this thing. Best ones don't. Some of them do. Number one thing you can do, make the top performer responsible for helping you roll out the training. Because now they're like, oh, I gotta own this thing. So they're gonna really learn it, and they always wanna make sure that they look good in front of the team. And it's the double whammy where, number one, the top performer is helping you make it real, and they're totally invested. And then number two, everyone's looking at the top performer, and they're like, if that person's doing it, I have no excuse to not do it. So if I ever wanted to flip a behavior change on my team, I would think, okay. What's the thing I wanna teach? Here's my top rep, Morgan Mello. Hey, Morgan. Would you go teach this thing for me? And it would work so much better than if I was saying it myself. Going back to the most common mistakes, I think a lot of people, they feel good when they're just constantly patting their top performers on the back. And it goes months and months and months and months. And then when you finally wanna give your top performers some hard feedback, when you see things aren't going perfectly, it's like you're ripping off this Band Aid because they've only heard validation from you for the last six months. And now you're, like, feeling like you're walking on eggshells. You're like, oh god. Am I gonna ruin their confidence? Are they gonna listen to me? They probably don't even respect you that much anymore at this point. So if you find that you're in that point of three, four, five, six months, you haven't really given them construction feedback, and you've got an outbreak that tension. How do I go about broaching that? You name it. Mhmm. It's so easy here. It's like, if you're feeling scared, if you're feeling vulnerable, if you're feeling fear, call it out. Hey, Arman. You have been our top rep now for the past six months, and I feel like all I've done is I've given you kudos and love. And, honestly, brother, you deserve it. And I also feel like I kinda wanna call you forward in a few types of areas. But in me doing that, as I said, I actually feel my heartbeat a little bit quicker because I'm scared to do that. Mhmm. Because I really care about you and I care about our relationship. And I also wanna have a relationship too with you where, like, I can do that. And sometimes I'm like, is Armand okay if I do that? I just wanna, like, name that. And, like like, let let's take this thing that I'm, like, really afraid to show you, and let me put it on the table, and let's both look at it. Hopefully, that just creates this relationship where, like, I'm just a freaking dude, and I'm trying to figure out how to coach you the best to be the best version of you and make this team great. And I feel scared doing it. You can't just do the hard behavior recorrect where all of a sudden, three, four, five, six months you haven't been coaching. And then overnight, you start coming in with all this critical feedback, negative feedback, whatever it is. They're gonna be like, did your boss come down on you? Smart performers gonna be wondering, like, what's going on? And what you're doing is you're almost reintroducing that permission based coaching ask that you talked about at the beginning of the show to force a conversation and change the tenor of the relationship, which I think is really smart. I mean, what it feels like you're doing is you're breaking the fourth wall, and you are calling out the situation before you try to address the situation or change it. And this is where a lot of people screw things up is they just go right to trying to change it and solve it when you can address it first, clear the air and be like, am I seeing this the same way? And then you can move towards changing it. I actually have a question for both of you guys about the frequency of coaching, feedback, constructive criticism, whatever you wanna call it, that you give to any individual rep. What I'm hearing from you is waiting six months before giving any sort of feedback of, hey, you might wanna change this is too infrequent. But I'm worried that, like, if I give a rep feedback on every single call, it might start to discourage them. So the opposite end of the spectrum might be I give them feedback or break them down a little bit every single time. Where is the right place for me as a leader on that spectrum? Every human being is different. I used to have this rep on my team. He's actually still one of my very good friends, a guy named Curry. If I coached him and told him too many things about where he could be improving, I would see literally the color in his face drain. And that would seep into literally every area of his life, not just on prospect calls, but also in his relationship and also in other areas that he's doing. And what I found is for him, he needed for me to be like, you're amazing. You crush. Keep on doing exactly what you're doing. And that instilled within him this power of, like, oh, man. I know what I'm doing here. And then, there were certain times where I was, like, hey, like, you're doing great there. Are you open for a little bit of respectful feedback on ways where I think you can improve? And then after he was already built up, he was like, yeah. Like, teach me. And then there's other people who are like, I don't know whether you wanna call him a masochist or what. They're like, punch me in the face repeatedly and tell me where I need to become better. Yeah. And those are the people who are just like, show me what I'm doing wrong. I can handle it, and let's go. There's really not, like, a one size fits all. I think the key thing that so many leaders struggle with is attunement to the person. Do you actually know this person personally? When you give them feedback, do they say yes, but emotionally are like, I can't handle this? And are you actually in tune with them? And, you know, honestly, what it takes is, like, are you as a leader actually in tune with yourself? Do you know when you're actually giving somebody feedback because you're freaking pissed off? Or are you like, hey, I'm pissed off. I need to make sure that I'm actually coming from the right place, and then give the feedback. And I'll give a a little example here. There was a a samurai and a bad guy, killed his master. And the samurai doing the thing that was right said, okay. I need to go now kill this guy who killed my master. And he goes and he finds this guy and he corners him in a room. And as he pulls out his sword, the guy spits in his face. What he does is he sheaves his sword, and he leaves. And then he comes back the very next day. He finds the guy who killed his master, takes out a sword, and he kills him. And his fellow samurai went up to he's like, dude, that guy spit in your face. Like, why didn't you kill him the first day? And he's like, well, when he spit in my face, I got angry. I wasn't going to kill him because I was angry. I was going to kill him because it was the right thing to do. And so what it takes is if you are the leader and if you're giving somebody feedback, be from a place of anger or fear or sadness, you need to make sure you'd need to check yourself and coming from the right place. And then once you're coming from the right place, then you can get the feedback or the coaching. I would usually give, especially beginning reps, feedback on pretty much every call. Yeah. Where that rep was in their life cycle depending on how much feedback they would get and what type of feedback they would get. In general, I wanted to clear the 20% line, which is if I'm coaching on something that isn't at least gonna have a 20% change, then I should really question, is this just me being petty or coaching to preference versus literally did they, like, not set an agenda at all? Yeah. That type of thing. And then as you get more and more mature and more skilled as a rep, now we're coaching to more stylistic stuff and trick shots and other things you could have done to, like we were talking about earlier, combine multiple stages in one call. But regardless, trying to keep it to one to two things on each call so it's not a whole punch list on every call is important. And you also need to read where that rep is, if they're sort of, like, overstuffed with feedback or not. But to Alex's point, what I wanna call out is a lot of times, a rep's ability to calibrate where they stand is completely null. And what I mean by that is one rep can get 10 pieces of positive feedback and one piece of negative feedback. Mhmm. And they can think that they're about to be on PIP. The next rep can get 10 pieces of negative feedback, one piece of positive feedback, and think, I'm going to President's Club this year. And so I think it's really important in the beauty of sales is other functions have to rely on an every six months performance review. We end months, we end quarters with quantitative results. And so I always recommend find some rhythm that works for you and your team, whether it's monthly, quarterly, whatever it is, where you pull up and you look at the trends. And that's where you can say, like, hey. Over the last months, you asked them to do a self reflection, and that's your opportunity to come in and be like, hey. Over the last seven calls we were on, I've noticed that these types of things have happened over and over and over again. And I wanted to see if we could workshop together a way that we can really improve your discovery skills because that seems like something that's coming up more often than not. You do it in the moment, but I think it's really important to have those pull up moments to give them a big picture, like, where do you stand? It's almost like, how do we get the boulders in place? Do you know how to frame a call? Are you doing the discovery well? Do you know how to give the demo well? Once we get those good, then let's start adding in the cool little, I'll let you said, trick shots Mhmm. There, the stylistic types of things. Let's get the foundational pieces down. Yeah. And until we get those down, I'm gonna repeatedly drill you on those things. Because you know after every single call, I'll be like, so how was your frame, dawg? Mhmm. And if it wasn't good, I'm gonna continue to say, how was your frame? And once you prove that, then let's go to the 201. Mhmm. 301. So I love that that perspective there. Well, you had a really good framework that you shared in the prep around the basic flow and the buckets of a discovery call. Could you maybe start with new seller? How would you coach them on a discovery call versus we'll go to middle and advanced? I've at least always been able to learn best by buckets. If you tell me I need to go and conduct a thirty minute initial meeting and I'm a new rep, I'm like, there's a lot of different components of that. I had there's there's a script. Don't even get me started on the demo. Right? You know, all these different types of things. So how do you actually break it up where it's digestible? And at least in the initial meeting, I break it up and do five different components of it. The upfront contract or the pre frame, whatever you wanna call it. It's the discovery, then it's the speaking to the trends that are happening within the space today. So it's not yet pitching your product, but, like, creating the lens through it. And then it's the, let's share about what our product does, and then it's the next steps. From there, it's really about, like, working your way through it. It's digestible for the rep. It's like, oh, there's only five key components that I really need to focus on. And then when it comes to doing, like, mock discovery calls or whatever, it's like, we're going to talk about how to be doing the frame over and over again. Yeah. Once you can do that, then we're gonna get to this wonderful world called discovery. And, you know, as we all know, there are so many different types of ways to be going about discovery, but it's like giving specific methodologies within that. I think a lot of reps, when they're being taught how to run an initial meeting, they miss the the forest through the trees where I remember when I first started running discovery calls, I was literally writing out word for word what I was going to say for a script for the whole call. And I'd get on with the customer, and I'd have literally two pages of notes, and I would end up losing myself, and I couldn't run the call effectively. You gave that framework. Could you make it a little more real for me and give an example of, like, how you would run that five step process with something you've sold in the past? It's like, a pre frame always comes with saying I appreciate the time. I wanna check to make sure we have thirty minutes. Always just like the upfront contract. From there, I break down the pre frame into four main components. It's how do you build credibility, how do you talk about what the agenda of the call is, how do you then talk about what the goal is going to be and then asking for permission. So, for example, if I was at Outreach, I'd say, hey. Appreciate the time. Wanna check if you have thirty minutes? Awesome. Little back in me, I speak with CROs and sales leaders literally every single day. And we usually were talking about how are we building pipeline, how are we looking at data, or how are we getting the reps actually rowing in the same direction. So today, what I love to do on this conversation is I love to actually talk to you about, are those problems actually relevant for you? Mhmm. If not, what is actually relevant for you? From there, I'm happy to give you a little bit of reflection. If it makes sense, share how Outreach goes about solving some of those issues. If there's alignment from there, the next step would either be to get other people from your team involved or even show you what the platform looks like. I'm curious. What else would you like to cover on today's conversation? So I'm actually just, like, teeing up and you notice, like, I'm really breaking it down very easily. And that I'll see, you know, I've taught that to now at this point, probably over a thousand reps who just, like, nail these key steps along the way. Discovery is one of my favorites because there's so many different types of ways to do it. And it's also about each rep has different ways that they talk and communicate. And so I always like to give, like, legitimate tactics on here's one type of discovery. Here's another type of methodology. My three to four favorite is, first off, coming in with a hypothesis. Do you actually have a perspective on their business, that you can say, hey. Here's what I've read about your company. Here's what I'm assuming your problems are. Is that right? And the beautiful part about that is if you're right, they're gonna say yes. And Mhmm. If you're wrong, it doesn't matter. They're gonna say, no. That's not right. Here is what my problems are. So at least they're giving you the answer at the end of the day. Another type of discovery I always love is just like lay of the land. Right? This is the simple. How many people on your team? What type of tech are you using? Different stuff like that. Like, it's almost like, hey. Before I ask you maybe the heavy hitter questions, I need to say, what's your name? Do you live here? Like, before I ask to meet your parents, for example, can I get to know, like, what's what's up with you? Once you get that, then you can go what I like to call the heaven and the hell. And this is the key here. It's like, how do you get somebody speaking to what is the heaven? What's your vision? What are you going for? How would it feel? What are the emotions that would happen? What would that enable within your life? And then from there, flip it. What's holding you back? What would actually prevent you from getting there? How long has that been occurring? What have you done to try to solve for it? What happens if you don't solve for it? What you're trying to do here is you say, here's the heaven, here's the hell, and this beautiful area here, that's the gap. If you can make them feel the freaking pain of that gap, that's going to get them into a state of commitment to say, oh, shit. Now that we're talking about this, I'm realizing that there's a serious issue here that I need to figure out how to solve, whether it be with their solution or something else. You're getting them into a state of commitment to continue that conversation. We'll pause on the discovery piece there, but I just wanna underscore something that you said earlier, which is, like, at the beginning, big boulders, and you have these four or five buckets that you're coaching to. And when I'm working with a junior seller, I'm like, did you even do the four buckets? Mhmm. For me, it was always, did you set a purpose plan outcome agenda? Did you get to at least one business problem in your discovery? Did you get through next steps? How you did it might be really ugly in that first level of selling, but if you just did it, if you got the steps right, we're golden. Yes. The second level of seller, now we can start to think about style. Right? Were you able to have, like, pretty finesse questions? Did it not come off as awkward? Did you kill the awkward silences in the call? Were you able to read the room and time your questions the right way? And so it's the style of how you're getting it. And then that top level of seller is really when you start to become an adviser where it's like, okay. If they had the wrong diagnosis on the problem or on the solution, were you able to, like, sit there toe to toe with them and actually challenge them? But you're not gonna be, like, pushing a level one seller on the tone of their question when they didn't even set an agenda in the first place. The last thing I'll say is this. Yes. It's important to coach a sales professional powerfully. It's always important to teach people how to great frame, how to do discovery, demo, all this sort of stuff. Obviously, the outcome is you want them to crush their quota so you can build a team. But there's something more that I think people sometimes forget to, like, tap into. And it's almost like, people have been driving a convertible and the top's been up the entire time. Mhmm. And it's like, let's take the top down and let's, like, open up to, like, why are you teaching these people? Right now, especially if you get a junior seller, they probably got a job in sales because, like, I don't know. I just need to learn how to, like, make money and do stuff. And, what you're teaching them is invaluable skills about how to relate to people, how to truly be in a deep level of presence with somebody, how to be able to read, oh, this person's guarded or this person's really open, how to lovingly challenge prospects. And you're helping them to do something so much more. You're teaching them how to maybe one day step into entrepreneurship because they know how to sell. You're teaching them how to communicate with somebody and maybe that's gonna help them find a partner. Mhmm. You're teaching them how to actually build confidence within themselves. And so, so often if a leader's like, I need to coach you so that you can hit quota. It's like, yeah. And it's so much more than that. You're truly teaching somebody something that is going to open up so much possibility. And I think we all have a leader who we can think of who we've been coached by, like, man, that person made me a great sales professional, but did a hell of a lot more than just make me a better sales professional. I know so many managers who don't know anything about their reps' personal goals, their financial goals, why they're in sales in the first place. Do you have a frame or a process to figure this stuff out about your reps so that you can really understand what their goals are? We do the four quadrant exercise. You talk about what are your goals from a work slash career perspective, from a health perspective, from a relationships perspective, as well as from a time money slash freedom perspective. As opposed to doing an account plan QBR, I'd actually ask them to create that and share it with the entire team. And then maybe that was the frame that then talk about your account plan. But it just made this whole different thing of, like, oh, man. Like, I know what my team wants. And if I'm an account executive and I see other account execs, I feel like, this is my crew here. Those small things where it's like, yes. I wanna blow out our numbers, and I wanna do that because, man, look how awesome we are together. Amazing. Alex, we talked about a lot of great habits when it comes to coaching top performers, teams, really just getting to know the people behind the reps. It's time to talk about one thing that every leader should stop doing. So what is one bad habit that every leader should break so so that all teams get a little bit better? Stop acting like you know everything. If you have a pipeline problem, you don't have the answers to it because you're probably not the one who's making the cold calls or shooting out the emails or talking to your prospects every freaking day. Your job is to say, hey, guys. Here's the problem that we have at hand, and there's a lot of collective wisdom amongst this team. And I love for us to see if we can access some of it. Intelligence lies typically with a few, where now it's moving to there's a collective intelligence. And how do we actually gain access to it? The way that we gain access to it is by the leaders saying, I don't have the answers, but I have the questions. And how do we actually start approaching that? Amazing mic drop. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap. Coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this first leadership episode with Alex Kremmer. What do you have for your two? So the first one is when you start working with somebody on your team for the first time, new rapper, somebody that you inherit, the first thing that you need to orient around is, like, what are they looking to accomplish? Are they motivated by money? Do they wanna move up in their career? Do they wanna figure out if sales is for them? Figure out what they are oriented around, and then ask and gain their permission to push them. Because now you know where they're looking to go, and you have permission to help them get there, which might require hard feedback. That lays the foundation for all future conversations with that salesperson. Number two is a big mistake that folks make frankly in any personal situation, but especially in sales leadership is when they have a situation with somebody on their team that they want to change, they immediately jump to trying to change that situation. And what Alex shared with us is before trying to change a situation, you first need to break the fourth wall and call out that situation that is going on. Call out the dynamic and get on the same page there. And then you can actually start trying to change it with both parties as opposed to you doing something, and they're like, where the hell is this coming from? Number three, your top performers oftentimes motivated by carrots. So the way you might coach them differently is you might say like, hey. Your discovery call is at an eight. You think I could give you a couple things that'll take it to a 10? Another thing that you can do is put your top performers into the limelight. Make them be the ones who are running the trainings on your behalf and not only will that get them to master the concepts better, but then two, all the other performers on their team are gonna be like, oh shoot that rep is doing it so I should probably do it too. And then lastly, number four, try to coach your reps in buckets. It is really hard to learn how to do a discovery call if all of your feedback feels very random. But if you break the call into the buckets of the call, you can start by just saying, okay, did you even get each bucket right? And then you can start to give them more and more stylistic tweaks within each bucket once they at least get the basic steps correct. Alright, Nick. How can people help us out? So we've done very, very few episodes around truly changing the culture of your team in a really, really tactical way. If you liked this episode, we did an interview with Stephanie Jenkins who is the VP of global sales at a company called PandaDoc. That was a similar episode to this one around how you can effectively, tactically change the way that you interact with your team and change the team culture so that you build a really, really strong selling culture. So if you like this episode, there's there's a link to the one with Stephanie in the show notes. Give it a listen, and we'll see you next week on the show.
