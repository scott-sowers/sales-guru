## Transcript

Don't think leaders prepare themselves enough for conversations with their team. I think they put the onus on the rep to show up to a one on one. You know, it's like, okay. Great. Let's walk through your pipeline. You're the leader of this team. You should go in with a point of view, know where they are at any given time for performance, and have already done the preparation for what you want the outcome of the meeting with your rep to be. And I think leaders are lazy on prep. They've got systems informing them of what matters and what's happening. But I think the best leaders out there from a good habit standpoint prepare for every single interaction with their team because just as much as the end customers are customers, the reps are customers as well. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my host, Mark Cosgrove. And today, we have a deal unblocking metrics mastery question asking machine in the one and only Sean Crimmins. He's a director of sales over at Gong, and this is honestly one of the best interviews we've we've had in a minute. I mean, this is we've had some great guests, but these are really good. Mark, why should people listen? I'm wondering if people listening have ever asked themselves, why won't my reps prospect even though they know they need to? I think Sean gives you some answers on how to do that. Or, like, where do I kinda start with my baseline dashboards and how do I organize them? Because I feel like I'm hopping all around randomly looking at just weird stuff. Sean talks about that. He also talks about if you've ever had the question of how do I kinda tie my forecasting and all that into something that reps actually get benefit out of versus just being like an exercise that everybody runs up, the flagpole once a week. I I think Sean really digs into those sorts of things in this episode. Well, folks, dig in because this is one heck of an episode. And three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, Sean. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Okay. Number one, reverse engineering the number into executable behaviors. I think, ultimately, pipeline math is simple, but leaders make it super complex by not tying the math to weekly behaviors and what the team should be shooting for. So what I will actually do is start with what we call, like, a pipeline math whiteboard. Start with the revenue target, 200 k. That's what we're trying to close this month. Okay. Let's break that out. What does our win rate need to be? If our win rate is averaging around 25%, that means we need to win 200 k times point two five, that's how many dollars, divided by our average contract value, that's how many deals you ultimately need to win. And then, ultimately, what you can do is back that into a number of ops the rep needs to create on a week to week basis so they have enough pipeline to hit the overall target. And then, again, it becomes a matter of how are we inspecting our progress week over week? Are we coaching them to the right behaviors to create those opportunities? What opportunities are they focused on creating and activating? But effectively, it becomes a system that you can then look at week to week and know where are we against the overarching goal and the behaviors we need to be putting in week over week, month over month. I will say this was a big unlock for us at Vanta. We used to be a heavy inbound sales motion. You know, everybody needed a SOC too. As we started to progress more upmarket, it became crucial for us to go from, call it, 90% inbound to 50% inbound. So massive unlock for us. This system was how we created the motion for reps to know week over week how many deals they need to be creating, how many of those need to be advancing, and what the skills are tied to the overarching outcome. And that was how we really moved the needle on our outbound pipeline, attribution. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. If we reverse engineer a great episode, usually, three great take aways lead to one good episode. So what's number two? Okay. I love it. Alright. Number two. It's reinforcing execution and what those behaviors are through your operating rhythm. The way that I think about it is, like, a sales floor that does not have, a rhythm is ultimately chaos. And it is your job as the revenue leader to create the rhythm because that's where execution actually lives. So your weekly cadence and your operating rhythm of forecast calls, one on ones, deal inspections, All of that should be documented, how you're going to run those meetings, what your outcome is, and, ideally, they're building on each other because that is how you are reinforcing quality execution. The way we did this and, again, I I think back to my time at Vanta, because we had reps that have probably, like, 30 to 40 opportunities at any given point in time. And what I always heard from my leaders is I don't have time to inspect those deals. So I said, okay. How can we get to the heart of deal inspection with three simple questions? And that was what we did. So the first question we would ask is all around why. Why do they need to buy? What's the impact to the organization? What is this gonna unlock for them? And why do they really need our solution anchored in business impact? Step one. Step two, why aren't they gonna buy? Why not? I want the reps to bring a POV on where this deal falls down, why it won't progress, and why ultimately we will lose the opportunity so that we can spot those risks earlier and proactively address them. The third question is, why now? Why out of any given point in time is there a compelling event or reason for them to move forward with our solution now? Those three questions, while simple, why, why not, why now, ultimately got to the heart of what's going to kill a deal or move it forward faster. And it was a very quick way to run deal inspection when you have a large pipeline that you're trying to cover. Alright. Bring it home. What's number three? Okay. Number three. Number three is also, a good one. So coaching with metrics and rewarding the execution. I'm gonna stick with mostly, like, coaching to metrics. I think a lot of leaders will often struggle with, okay. What am I measuring? How can I coach to these things? But, ultimately, like, I think we know if you can't measure something, you really can't coach to it. So three step framework to identifying what are the gaps and then building a plan against it. The first is identifying the gap. With all the metrics we look at as sales leaders, be it attainment, pipeline generation, conversion rates through stages, win rates, average contract value, there's a plethora of data that you have to find what the gaps are in somebody's execution. Step one, identify that gap. Ideally, the AE is self assessing. You're bringing qualitative assessment. But step one is identifying the gap. Step two is validating that that gap actually is tied to certain behaviors. So there's a metric that's lagging. What are they doing to have that metric actually be less than ideal? So this is where you're either watching calls, you are asking a rep where the gap is showing up, we're doing deal reviews, loss reviews, but validate the behaviors that are leading to the less than ideal metric. The third step is coaching to it. So co creating a coaching plan that has monthly check ins. Ideally, you're doing this every quarter, where it is a behavior based plan that is not vague. It's here's what we wanna be doing. Here's what good execution looks like, and measure their behavior against the execution. Right? Instead of looking at the lagging metric of revenue or win rates, what are the behaviors that you wanna look at and coach to week in, week out so that you know you're making progress on the overall metric? So coaching with metrics and rewarding that execution is tip number three. Sean, I wanna go back to this sales math thing. I think so many reps just don't understand how to do this kind of math. So let let's walk through it like I'm one of your reps. First of all, like, give me the setting. Is this something that I do in a one on one? Is it a team meeting? Is it something I do as a new hire? Do I do it once a quarter? Like, help me understand the logistics of when and how I do this math. I think there's natural check-in points that you're gonna have. For example, quarterly performance reviews or business reviews. QBRs are a great way to back into, here's my number on the quarter and here's my plan to get there. Everybody's talking about what their plan is for the quarter, doing a retrospective. I do this at least quarterly with any reps and, obviously, the leaders that report into me. The second area is I'll do this on a month to month basis to check pacing. Okay. So if the target was 200 k, and these are the underlying assumptions of how many deals you needed to create, how off what rate you needed to win those at, and at what dollar amount, how are we pacing? Because that's gonna indicate what we can do with the remaining sixty, thirty days we have left in the quarter. The other thing that I'll do is I think reps sometimes, if you notice that pipe gen is lacking or if their mix of pipeline is low, it's an easy way to refocus them on controllables. Because the number itself, quota, revenue targets can feel very out of reach. But if you can re anchor on look. We ultimately need to go out and find 10 deals over the next thirty days. We need to win 25% of those eventually, and and we gotta have an average contract value of, call it, 50 k. If we can go find 10 deals in the next thirty days that are qualified, we've got a shot. And it sort of reinvigorates the AE, I think, to feel like, okay. I can prospect. I can go out and find 10 opportunities or maybe they've got a BDR they can sit down with. But it immediately takes this overarching large number and ties it to things that they feel are way more controllable so that you can anchor against things that, you can measure. The energy is just so much different when you say we need to go find 10 opportunities versus hit your quota. Hit your quota just feels so nebulous. Finding 10 ops, that feels it doesn't feel easy, but at least it feels doable. 100%. You do this, like, you know, once a quarter pretty much. You check-in every month to make sure things are going with your pacing. How do you factor in, like, inbound and SDR pipeline? Because I'm sure your reps don't have to create all of their deals. Totally. We're still, at Gong and even at Advanta prior heavy outbound motions. So a lot of that math, the math stays consistent. Right? Like, the math is the math. Mhmm. And, ultimately Mhmm. I think it's a different set of behaviors, though, that can change the math and, ultimately, make sure, okay. You know, if you have a higher average contract value in, for example, your outbound sales motion, maybe you wanna dial up your outbound pipeline generation because we're seeing in the numbers, you win those deals at a 50% higher average contract value. Imagine if your pipeline was full of those opportunities and you win those at a higher clip, all of a sudden it changes the numbers. Same thing with inbound and SDR. I really anchor against a total pipeline number because in my point of view, like, look, the AE is the the CEO of their pipeline. Okay? If they wanna rely on inbound and SDRs, it's probably not gonna produce a good result, and you can show them that in the math. But I really anchor against total pipeline created. This is what we need to do. I think breaking out the cuts, though, is another way you can introduce what's called controllables. Or usually, those have a different contract value, which can be the light bulb moment for some where they say, oh, yeah. When I go out and find my own opportunities or I partner with my SDR to drive a really good account breaking strategy, those deals I win at, like, a 6 figure clip. So I really wanna lean into that activity over the next month. So, again, I think it reanchors the AE around these controllables, and it makes them more palatable. That kind of coaching to me is when reps, the light bulb comes on for reps, and they start understanding how to control their business versus just knowing it. Knowing I need 20 ops a quarter is very different than controlling the fact that I'm gonna get at least 20 a quarter. I I I think you're yeah. Awesome. Two things two things that I think, were light bulb moments for me. I had this sort of coaching very early on, at HubSpot where it was, like, it was very much so anchored around the math that we needed to go out and execute against to feel good about our number and to feel good. My manager would ask me week in, week out against those same metrics. But I think the unlock for me was when I did my first sort of quarterly business review as a leader, where you get into the data and all of a sudden you start to say, man, if I won more of these opportunities at a higher clip or my win rate on this this bucket of deals is really strong, if I lean in there and pour some gasoline, and if you can start getting reps to think with that mental model, all of a sudden, everybody's Bill James from Moneyball, and they're really juice their pipeline. Right? So, big fan. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. There's one other detail that I think is really important that we might have skimmed over, which is you're having AEs go after sometimes bigger or higher win rate opportunities. And, Mark, I know that your approach to AE prospecting is very similar where you don't have them doing spray and pray. You have them going after, like, offset or, like, double the ACV. So I'm curious. Mark, could you walk through your approach to AE prospecting? And then, Sean, I'd love to hear your reactions to it and understand, like, what's similar or reactions to it and understand, like, what's similar or different. What I love about Sean is it makes things doable and easy, and now I can go act and not think so much. You know? Thinking is what keeps us from acting. And I do the same sort of thing. I listen to Sean. I can think of a a couple adjustments that I should make. But the first thing that I do is the first week of the quarter, especially in deal and deal cycles that are over thirty days and on roles with deal cycles over thirty days, is the first week is with your manager, identify for me 10 accounts that have deals that are double our a c our normal ACV. Like, go find those big ones out there, and then pick the 10 that we have the best business case that we can create the best value for based on your research. So you spend the whole first week of the quarter doing that. The second week, you meet with your VP, and at Outreach, you'd meet with me and your VP and your manager. And your manager and you would make a case. This is why I've picked these 10. That's where we can start to see, oh, well, they we have a common investor, and I know, like, a director of sales over there. And you know what? And I'm like, that that doesn't mean they need us. That just means that you know somebody and you feel comfortable. Find a business case, and then we can though we can leverage those things. Right? So we get to change their thinking on how to, find the right accounts. And then the third week, I and our VP would then go to marketing, and we start to create alright. These are the deals we're going after outbound. What's other support? What kinda air cover can you give us? SDRs, what can you do for these deals? Right? And then they have the whole rest of the ten weeks of that period to just go land three of the 10 accounts as opportunities. And since they're a double ACD, you can start to see, man, we would take care of 50% of our pipeline needs for a quarter off of three deals, and everybody had these big rocks that they were excited about doing that every single quarter. It was huge. So that's that's our that was the process that we would use, but I could see how your process, Mary, with that might inform it even more. There's a ton of crossover there, and I think it really when you bring in the concept of tiering, that's where I see this really come to life. Because I imagine that those accounts where people had a really good POV on a business case were tier one accounts. You knew you could win those and land them in a high clip or they're already a customer. You knew you could get the next land. So with tiering, we go through a similar exercise, and that's where we really pressure test what's the plan to get in there. And, usually, those tier ones, because we're using firmographic, technographic, etcetera from ops, but it's like, they should have a higher average contract value. So it's exactly I think it's very, similar and that it's it's kind of the money ball approach, right, of where do I win? Where do I win my highest? And how can I leverage that in my weekly activities and my day to day? So, big fan. I think there's a ton of crossover there. Yeah. Are you having reps just load up people into your sequences and Gong and just letting it rip, or are you taking a a more, like, account plan enterprise motion ABM ABS type of whatever they call it now? I don't know what they call it anymore, but, like, like, how do you how are you doing that? Yeah. I mean, I'd say we we definitely lean more towards now this concept of one to one prospecting. I think in a world where there is a ton of noise, I'm sure you guys feel it, I feel it, and everybody has a canned message that they go out with. There's a lot of value in, one, proving you're a human being, and, two, having a strong point of view on how you can help somebody or add value. I think that is back in a big way. And at the same time, for accounts that are tier three, lower tier accounts, there is a way that you can sort of personalize at scale, tailor at scale, and we're doing that as well. But with those tier one lands, like you said, these marquee accounts, the big bets, what is our plan to break into these in a personalized one to one way? And prospecting with that in mind, whether it be gifting or, obviously, phone calls is is huge right now. Personalized emails, videos, that type of concept we've seen resonate well and usually lead to those bigger lands. But I still think there is a world where prospecting volume or or prospecting at scale, it it fits in. It's just who do you do that with? And you also brought up what a blasphemous concept, though, to work with marketing on this. Right? Like, hey, marketing. These are the accounts we wanna land. Let's actually allocate some budget or some retargeting towards maybe the tier twos, the tier ones. Let's put an event in this area. We did that a ton of Banta, and that's how we really activated some of our best, call it, upmarket accounts. But that's our big unlock. So let's go back to what we were talking through on metrics. I would love to understand if I'm Sean Crimmins, I walk into my day, I open up my dash boards, what is on your, like, golden sales leader dashboard? What are the key metrics that I should know as a sales leader? And let's assume that you're a frontline manager for the sake of today even though you manage managers. And then let's talk about example things you could see that are going wrong and how you'd fix them. But let's start with just, like, what's on the dashboard. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. This is, I mean, it's great timing because we're actually going through an exercise of sort of retweaking what we give our frontline leaders to go out and talk about week over week. So I think at the top line, it's look. I mean, where are we in the quarter from a revenue standpoint and overall attainment? How are we doing? What are the top line results if you think about it? From there, a little bit more of a breakdown on current pipeline. How many deals do you have in quarter? Total pipeline coverage in quarter. And then forecast categories. I am relentless about forecast categories because I think it informs where you spend a lot of time as a leader. So how much of your current pipeline sits in best case, most likely, and commit? So that I get a very quick snapshot. If you think about, like, the results, here's where I'm at today, here's the pipeline available to me, and how I have that categorized. So that's step one. Step two, a little bit more about pipeline generation and current stage deals. Let's start with current stage deals. I think it's a bit of a breakdown of, okay, of those opportunities with the forecast categories. Now I'm looking at a deal board of, how many of those sit in various different stages? What is the mix of my pipeline from large opportunities to small? As a frontline manager, what I and I encourage my leaders to do this still today, is when they go into their one on ones, first thing to look at is when you're talking about this deal section. What calls are happening this week that are already calendered? You gotta inject yourselves there, especially if it's a bigger opportunity. If you haven't already listened to the call or done a deal inspection on an opportunity, you don't wanna leave that one on one without discussing it because there's a call on the books and everybody talks about books. What's our plan? What do we need to uncover? And what are we gonna deliver in that meeting and the outcome? So, again, pipeline mix. From there, I think about pipeline generation. Okay. In the last week and trending on the month, month to date, how many new opportunities have you created? How many of those have moved to qualified opportunities? What's the conversion rate between those two? So that I can understand, are we actually building future pipeline, and what does that look like? Same thing I'll layer on is the mix. So inbound, STR, outbound. What's our rough mix of pipeline generated? And the last thing, which you never wanna really look at, but it's activity. But if you start with overall outcomes, right, if revenue is down, if our mix of pipeline is not there, and if our pipeline generating activities are not strong, then we're gonna have to talk about how many emails, calls, what does the personalization look like, what's our account strategy we're trying to break into. Now there's different sort of flags that can go off at any one of those, but that's how I roughly think about taking down a one on one, and going through the activities that, that drive revenue. It's basically a funnel about it, but it's a it's a reverse. It's a funnel flipped, and you start work your way down. This is hilarious because we were just going through Mark's metrics dashboard, and it's the exact same thing that you have just upside down. Oh, there you go. So simple. It's literally just inputs to outputs, yours is outputs to inputs. But sometimes these dashboards, they drive me crazy because they don't tell a story. It'll be like, here's pipeline generation and then win rates and then, like Yeah. Average deal size and then best commit most likely. And it's like, what? It's like, I'm I'm I'm making, like, 17 mental leaps. It's very easy when you just put metrics in chronological order, and then you can see when there's a gap in a step, and that's the problem to solve. So let's do an example here. Of all of these, the four categories on your dashboard are you have the key results, so like attainment, pipeline, etcetera. You have pipeline mix. You have pipeline generation, and then you have, like, activity or inputs. Pick any one of those areas or any component on your dashboard and say, I saw something wrong with this component. Here's how I would diagnose the problem and build a program around it. Okay. I'm gonna go towards more of the pipeline mix because I think it's tied to forecast. Because ultimately, as a leader, whether you have a dedicated forecast call or whether you are doing this in one on ones, that's really what you're trying to figure out is what's the path to my number, and where is it coming from? And I think the pipeline mix area is where a lot of leaders will gloss over or just talk about deals instead of really going deep here. So for me, it all starts with forecast categories. Because, again, I I think forecast, while the output is ideally you are accurate, that's the outcome. But forecasting is really about a system of control, deal inspection, and execution. So when you think about it, start with your pipeline mix. Of all the deals you have in, let's say, this month, how many of those at the first line are best case most likely come in? What's the path to your number on the month or quarter? And if you can't see that in the deals that exist today, if I can't see that as a manager, red flags. Because I also hold my leaders accountable to what I call deals to dollars. My managers will show up to the forecast and, yeah, they bring math to validate, but they have a list of deals that gets them to their call. And some of those are in best case, but they have a plan to move it into most likely and commit. So I think that's where it starts from a pipeline mix standpoint. So if that is off and I can't see the path to your number in your current pipeline mix, then I'm gonna move to, okay. Well, where are the what's the inventory we currently have? And that's usually on the left hand side where it's okay. How many deals are at discovery? How many deals are, advanced or an outcome validation or business alignment further stages down your funnel? So you get an understanding of a leader as, okay, of the inventory that is in my pipeline or this rep, what is available for them to still close? And if you still can't identify some opportunities that are gonna lead to the number, that's where I'm going to the next section. I'm like, okay. Well, we gotta talk about PyCha. How many meetings have we set? What's upcoming on the calendar? How can we start to influence this? But for me, it's really that middle section of where it all lives. Because, again, if I can't see my path to the number and the rep can't see that path, it becomes very hard to influence the outcome. That's good, dude. So you're looking at their forecast categories, and you're making sure that they have a clear path to their number based on what's in their most likely, what's in their commit, what's in their best case, etcetera. If not, you go down the dashboard. You look at what's earlier, maybe stage two, stage three opportunities that you can pull into your forecast. And then if you don't have anything there, you gotta go find it out in the wild. Now let's pretend that you look up at the top, and they have everything they need to cover their forecast and more. Do you still go down the dashboard and flag things like, hey. You're not prospecting anymore, or what do you do if it looks good at the top? Well, luckily, a lot of these conversations will start there where it's like things are going well. That's great. Without getting into the motivation and people's why and the psychology, I mean, look, execution is the end goal and the output is going to be revenue and that's what you're going to see. But I think strong execution, green, should be at every level of that quote unquote dashboard. So the results should be there. Your mix of pipeline should be strong. You're still generating new pipeline for the future and your activity is there. And when you get high performers, I think there's always this angst that they want everything to be green, but truly, like, the the end goal might be to hit your target or to have, like, for example, that top line key result. But that goes away at the end of the for example, like, if it's a if that's your quarter for q two. Yeah. The top's great. It's green. But if the bottom of that dashboard or if all those things that are the foundation of that are red, you get into q three and you're gonna you're gonna whiff. And that's just sales. Right? And that's why everybody you know, the next the next day after the end of a quarter is everybody's back to zero. And there's beauty in that dashboard because, again, it's sort of a foundational build up. And, yeah, it's great that the top is there, but execution is all levels are hitting at the same time. And that's how you actually get sustained consistent performance. I used to have a manager. He was at HubSpot, and he would say, a a really good sales rep will do a 150% of their number. A great sales rep hits a 100% every month. Consistency. Right? And, obviously, you know, it was sort of some tongue in cheek from him. But there's a lot of validity in that because, you know, the result is there one quarter. That's great. But if the underlying activities are not a system of execution, then you are going to miss. How do you find truth from fiction? Like, you you got people putting things in forecast categories. That seems like really to be the engine of your system. But, like, shit. I'm gonna just put it in commit to get Sean and then my manager off my back. Like, how how are you dealing with that kind of stuff? It's where everything starts. If you don't have definitions for best case, most likely in commit, we do. We've got them documented. They're also tied to Medic. So certain things that you uncover throughout Medic are gonna unlock that next criteria. But your your forecast is only as good as that system of execution, one, and it's also only as good as your frontline. So if your frontline is taking something and most likely as, okay. Great. This is gonna land. Commit. It's gonna land. Then, ultimately, that is going to be where things fall apart. So number one, you've gotta have foundational definitions. What does the best case mean to you versus me? It could be different. But we need to align on that and calibrate so that the field knows what's a best case deal. And for us, we've got a criteria that unlock it. The second part though is then how do you weave that into your rhythm? And And I think that's where managers will typically start because I start on my forecast calls with my leaders. I'll say, okay. Great. You're calling 500 k. You're at a 100 right now for the month. Walk me up from a 100 to 500, and you can use some math to talk to me about your assumptions. But I want you to walk me through deals that get you to 500, and they will list off some deals. Okay. Great. Now I will go through all of those forecast categories starting with commit. And I there's some things that should already be true of this account that I can ask them in that deal review or that sort of, manager forecast call. So did they meet the qualities of commit? We shouldn't have to spend a ton of time on those deals, especially when I am talking to them, but then we work our way down all the way to best case. And then usually when you get the best case, it's about, okay. What can we do to drive more urgency, align on timeline, or see if we can move this deal into a most likely category? It all starts with the definitions. And then, again, the rigor in which your managers, your leaders, your executives are pressure testing everything is where it actually starts to become accurate. It sounds like you have some gates or some questions that you ask about each one, and and MEDDPIC seems to be very much, entangled in all of that. My understanding is that MEDDPIC is about qualification. Do we can we get a deal done? Not about how likely we are to win it. Whether I know the economic buyer or the metrics or not, that doesn't mean I'm gonna commit or be best likely. It just means that I know more information. How are how are you guys specifically tying MEDDPIC to forecast stages? Like and if you wanna be super explicit, like, hey. If you get the p and the p and the c, you're in this. If you get the m and the e and I, you're in this. Like like, break it down for me because I think that this is, where a lot of people get confused. And when you cross pollinate qualification with forecasting, you can get to errors. And now Gong is like a first class sales organization. So I know you guys aren't doing that. So I'm wondering how you have figured that out. Yeah. For sure. And I think you make a very good point is that MEDDIC is a qualification framework. It's not something you run your sales process against. Now I think MEDDIC is a way to pressure test these opportunities to know, okay. The rep is saying that this is qualified, and I've got some MEDDIC or whatever your framework is information, either in your CRM or whatever it is, your tool of choice or what the rep is telling you. We should still be able to pressure test that. Right? So, for example, if we're talking about a mid market opportunity and we really don't have a champion and my rep is calling this as a commit, I've got a mid match. Right? Like, I'm like, okay. This is in our commit category. We don't have a champion. We haven't tested that person. Help me understand that, like, that discrepancy. So it's not purely stage gate tied to Medic. Medic, I think, is laid on top of it. Because if at any point in time, if I've got a deal in commit, I should feel pretty good about all the elements of Medic. Right? If I'm committing a deal, I should probably know who the economic buyer is and when they're gonna sign this. I should probably know what the decision process is because if it's in commit, for me, that's, like, 90%. Like, you're not gonna miss that. Right? So you should know what their paper process is and their eval criteria. So I think it's it's something you lay on top of it, but you're absolutely right in that it's not foundational to to where it's like, okay. Now we know more about Medic. It helps me give a similar lens to pressure test or to call bullshit sometimes in some cases, right, of, like, I'm seeing a mismatch. Maybe I'm missing something, but help me understand. That's how I use it as a way to facilitate that convo about the deal. How do you define best case, most likely, and commit? You probably have a bunch of criteria, but could you give us the simple definition for each? When I think about a best case opportunity, it's a qualified deal. Right? We there is something there. What if you think about the why, why not, why now, I can pretty much answer the why and the why not. Like, I know what the risks are on the opportunity. I know why they would move forward. There is a there is a reason that they would see value in the system, the solution, etcetera. But I'm still fuzzy on timeline. Maybe you haven't locked down exactly when this would happen, or maybe you haven't developed a business case point of view on why they should do this now. To me, the biggest, determinant of a best case deal is it could happen this quarter. It may not. And here's what I need to go figure out to determine if that's possible. That's, like, the very high level on a best case. When I moved to most likely, we know more about timeline, and there's a point of view on why they would actually move now. Solid business case. Right? There is pain. We could solve for it. You think about the risks. We know what those risks are. But they have agreed to move on our timeline. They've said, yes. Maybe it's your champion or the buying committee. They've said, we will make a decision within this quarter, and you've had that conversation. So the timeline conversation, the priority conversation, they've had it, and they have also aligned with your expectation of in quarter or in month. Commit is there's already action being taken on fulfilling that timeline. Paperwork, maybe it's in procurement, and the legal team has been pitched as very easy on your red lines, or it's insecurity. Right? And that's an easy conversation. So or there's defined timelines for procurement is the way I think about it. That's how I would roughly define each of those categories at a high level. Best case, timeline's very fuzzy. There's something there, though. Most likely, they've confirmed this timeline. There's still work to do, but they told us this timeline is what we're operating against. There's a mutual action plan, so to speak. Commit, timelines confirm with a vendor of choice, and we are actively taking steps to, to work together. Amazing show. We talk about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit. But what is one bad one that every sales leader should break so that all teams get a little bit better? I don't think leaders prepare themselves enough for conversations with their team. I think they put the onus on the rep to show up to a one on one or to a forecast call or to a team training of like, okay. Great. Let's walk through your pipeline. But you're the leader of this team. You should go in with a point of view, know where they are at any given time for performance, and have already done the preparation for what you want the outcome of the meeting with your rep to be. And I think leaders are lazy on prep. They've got systems informing them of what matters and what's happening. But I think the best leaders out there from a good habit standpoint prepare for every similar interaction with their team because just as much as the end customers are customers, the reps are customers as well. It's just of your leadership style and approach. And I think often we do reps a disservice. I'll probably get heat for this. But I don't think I don't think leaders prepare enough for conversations with their managers, and that's a terrible habit. Can't agree more. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Mark. It's time for a three step recap and one thing you can do. Number one, you gotta build your sales math for your AEs. You start with what they need to hit their quota, what their win rate is, how much pipeline that needs, how many average deals they would need to close to generate that pipeline. And then from there, you have inputs to go and create those opportunities. That's number one. Number two, you can then put this in an upside down dashboard where you start with the results. So things like what's their quarterly attainment, their pipeline for deals in quarter, their forecast call, then you can go into their pipeline mix, and then you can go into their pipeline generation, and then you can go into their inputs. That's step two, the chronological sales manager metrics dashboard. And then step number three is if any metric is off, you can follow three steps. Number one, identify the gap in the data and ask the AE for their own story. Number two, validate that gap on your own time where you're looking at calls to make sure that that's actually the problem that you need to solve. And then number three, once you realize that that metric is the problem you need to solve, develop a coaching plan. So, for example, if you see stage one to stage two conversion is off, the rep says I suck at discovery. You look at the calls. He sucks at discovery. You say, great. We're gonna do a role play plan where you focus on these types of questions to fix your discovery. That's an example. Alrighty, Mark. What's one thing people can do right now? I would take ten minutes of every single one of your next one on ones. I would send a note out to your team and be like, for the first ten minutes of our one on one, we're gonna do sales math. I need you to know what your win rate is, what your average deal size is, and what your quota is. Right? Take those three things, and let's well and go through that math with every single person and define for them for this next period of time, this is exactly what you need to do. And just feel that. Feel what it looks like to be that prescriptive. I guarantee that you will find, like, the energy is much more accepting when you make things so simple like that. Folks, if you liked this episode, well, I've got two goodies for you that I've stolen from Mark, believe it or not. They are two one pagers. Number one is Mark's own forecasting process, which breaks down how he approaches this, which is, oddly enough, pretty similar to how Sean approaches it. And then number two, if you want an actual mock up of Mark's metrics dashboard, there's also a link to that below. So you got two one pagers, one on forecasting one zero one, and then another on how to run a sales manager metrics dashboard. Both are super helpful. They've They've honestly changed the way that I lead sales with Nick at thirty minutes to presidents club. Go check them out. We'll see you on the next one.
