## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And I recognize this episode, baby out of bounds, but I'm afraid to mention that this may in fact be the third episode with Charles Mollbauer, the head of sales enablement from CB Insights. Nick, why should people listen? Charles is so good at formulating questions. My biggest takeaway from this one is if you have tough questions to ask your prospect, maybe your boss says, hey. You need to go go to your prospect and ask them this. And you're like, I can't just say that to them. Charles has some really powerful stuff around softening statements, neutral dispositions at the end of your questions, turning open ended or rather turning closed ended into open ended questions. So if you wanna get better answers, ask better questions, and listen to this better episode. Three, two, one. I feel a little bit awkward playing this episode, but please enjoy this episode. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning.

If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Charles. Welcome to the show. You know that we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Thank you for having me again. Actionable takeaway number one, if you sense it or if you feel it, say it. If you sense something, call it out. If you feel that something is wrong in the conversation, there's tension, maybe the prospect is not really picking up what you're putting down, believing the value in the conversation, you call out and say, hey, Nick. I I could be way off here, but I'm getting the sense that you're not really seeing enough value in our conversation or or in what we do. Am I is that wrong? Right? And the tone matters there. You can laugh because it's funny. Call it out, and the prospect will respond appropriately. So that's actual number one. Number two, have a softening statement prior to any tough question. So for example, if a prospect is saying, hey. Listen, Charles. This is this is really interesting. I just wanna kinda bring it back to my team and, you know, talk about it internally and and maybe have a conversation. Why why don't you reach out to me next next Thursday, and we can see where we wanna go from there? Before I ask a tough question, like, what hesitations do you expect to hear from your team? I will give a softening statement and say, yeah. Absolutely, Nick. I I can appreciate that. I've been in this company for a couple years now, and it's totally, normal for someone like yourself to wanna speak to the team internally. I understand that there might be some healthy level of skepticism given that you haven't really seen the product. I totally get it. You know, thinking out loud here, what pushback would you expect your team to have when you bring this to them internally? So that is a very conversational way. Make any softening statement that you'd like as long as it's it's not informal, but it's we're going for the blend of casual and formal together. Beautiful. Rout us out, Charles. What's number three? Ask about hesitations. That could really run the gamut in a number of different areas. Let's say you ran a demo. So, Arman, based on on everything you've seen today, was there anything you were hoping to see that you didn't see? Or based on everything we we've seen today, I guess, who on your team do you expect the most pushback from? When you bring this back internally, what would you say would be the number one reason why you think we wouldn't be moving forward? Or even when we're close to the end, just asking a close ended question, Nick, is it sounds like you you you guys see enough value. I guess, is there any reason you can think of as to why we wouldn't be working together? Because when you think about you and the prospect, they're in a healthy way skeptical about working with you just as much as we are in a healthy way skeptical about working with them. Because if it's a SaaS business, we are which is based on recurring revenue. So if I feel that they're not gonna be here for a while, I have a healthy level of skepticism around that. And so I'm gonna wanna look for trouble just the same. So, Charles, one of the most common places that I see prospects looking for trouble is actually in that first demo where you're going deep into the product. It's not a harbor tour anymore. You're demoing for, I don't know, thirty, forty five minutes. And they start to poke and pick at all the little things even though on the big picture, you might be solving most of the big problems that they mentioned. So I'm curious. What do I do to reverse in that moment, or what do I do to call out the fact that it seems like they might be looking for trouble in a demo? So when I'm getting the sense the prospect is getting very nitpicky, I like to always go back to home plate and say something along the lines of, yeah, Arman, I I appreciate these questions. Just out of curiosity, you know, you mentioned at the beginning of the call that the the really number one area that is most important to you based on your decision criteria is x. Based on the questions that you're asking me right now, I'm getting the sense that there are other priorities. Am I off there? Right? So I wanna go back home. Now they will tell me, no. It's not really a priority. They could tell me a number of different things, obviously, but I can't control what they what they're gonna say. But they could say, I've seen account executives in that situation where the prospect said, no. These aren't these aren't real priorities for us. We're just kinda getting a a lay of the land. I just wanna make sure, Nick, that this is not really, like are these make or breaks for you guys? Or to what extent are these make or breaks in terms of your decision criteria? Because last we spoke, I didn't get the sense that these were gonna be big deals. So if I'm thrown off, I will call it out with a blend of blaming myself and also asking if it's a make or break. I'll throw in a a quick sales nugget. If anybody here is struggling with turning a closed ended question into an open ended question, Just use three words. To what extent? To what extent changes the game turning a closed ended question into an open ended question? So this is one thing that I I see happen a lot to first time sellers is they do this great discovery call. And then they get all of these priorities, and then they go into the demo, and then a prospect gets stuck back in the technical weeds. And one thing that's super important to notice around what Charles is doing is you're bringing them back to the priorities. And one thing that I love to do is once we do that, we say, hey. These things you're asking about, the integrations, the permissions, the security, all of that stuff, these are super, super important things. Usually, though, we find that these things don't even actually I mean, they matter, but it doesn't even make sense to talk about them until we're certain that we can solve x, y, and z for you. So do you mind if we cover these ones on our technical call with your IT team in two or three calls down the road? Because I would hate to talk about all this stuff and have you leave and not even be sure if we can solve your problems or not. The mindset that you wanna have ideally as a sales professional is, wait a second. I'm I'm kinda confused as to what's happening, Armand. You mentioned this, but now we're talking about these things. Where did I go wrong? And they're gonna help you. It's similar to the humbling disclaimer, which we talked about in other episodes. I'm very into the philosophy of empowering the prospect to do the work for me, to do the selling for me. So I'm okay with being wrong as long as they're correcting me. And if they're correcting me, that's great. And if I'm right, that's great. So it's it's a win win for me, and it takes the pressure. It takes the onus off of me completely. So that's the mindset, as to how I personally come up with these questions or executing these questions in the right tone with softening statements so that it's direct, but it's also landing well. I have a question actually for both of you, and it's based off of something that Arman said said earlier about the, hey. These were the big problems that you told me. Let's make sure we solve those first before we talk about the permissions and integrations and the nitpicky stuff. And I'm actually gonna use the to what extent piece. I'm curious, like, to what extent are you guys and how frequently are you reorienting the prospect around the home plate things? I'm thinking about this from the context of, like, I have sales cycles that will take me seven, eight, nine months. Do I need to be reorienting them around those priorities on every single call? Yeah. Sure. My short answer is absolutely. My long answer is if we have agreed for certain that their top priority is a, b, or c. I'm bringing that I'm always reminding them of that for two reasons. One, I have a terrible memory. And if I have a terrible memory, chances of them remembering every single detail from our last call is low. So I'm gonna do that, and I'll harp on that. Number one. Number two, you know, it's funny. In life, even though we know to do certain things, you know, have time management, be better people, improve our skills, invest in ourselves. It's one thing to know about it, but even though we know a lot of these a lot of these things, when we reread them, it brings us back. It grounds us and brings us back. Oh, I forgot how important this is. So that's another reason why I would bring it back. The third reason is I never know if something has changed, especially Nick, if you mentioned it's nine months long. So that if we're having a conversation, I would say something like Nick. So, you know, we've it seems looks like we've been in in really great having really productive conversations for around, since, November. From what I understand, these main priorities are still your priorities. To what extent have your priorities changed since we last spoke? Of course, I'm asking that just to make sure that we're on the same page and that we can actually help you. So those are the three reasons why I would go back home all the time. Charles, you actually made a post the other day that I I'll quote right now, and it's demo is really just, an excuse to do more discovery. And I'll I'll take it one step further in that demo is oftentimes your ability to just say that, hey. What I told you I could do in discovery, I wasn't lying. And so along the way, a lot of reps, they get these amazing nuggets that they find in discovery. They're losing people. They're missing revenue targets, what have you. But then they go into the same generic feature demo of you can save x amount of time by doing a b c one two three, what have you. Right? But I find what their best reps are able to do is they're able to say, hey. Last time you said priorities were x y and z. Let's actually zoom in on what this would look like in your day of the life. So as a podcast host, one of the things that you mentioned, Nick, is really, really important is when you're editing your podcast, every time your host sneezes, you can see asterisk sneeze here. And so what I'm showing you right now is Arman sneezing live in your podcast. And that's the concept of demoing in stories and demoing against the priorities that you shared with me earlier in discovery versus doing a generic feature for feature demo? A 100%, especially in a first call. I actually try to coach people and teach people not to name any features if they haven't especially, most importantly, if they if they haven't seen the platform. So a lot of people might say in a discovery conversation, oh, we have something called Mosaic or we have something called they don't first of all, they don't care what it's called. And second of all, as I mentioned earlier, they're not gonna remember what it's called because it's totally irrelevant. What I do teach is, listen. What we're going to help you with is this. And if the prospect asks, how do you do that? I'll explain. Oh, we do it this way and that way. But I'm not mentioning any features or tools. I'm kind of like talking about my offering as if we are a firm that provides a service without a product. The product is just a means to an end. I'll show you how we do it. There's it's just a means to an end. I'm gonna talk about the end the entire time. So that's one thing I wanna say. And the other thing I like to say is in addition, Armand, to what you said, I also teach my reps to run the demo through the eyes of a customer that is in the same space as the prospective client. So I might say, would it be okay, Arman, if maybe we run through this walk through through the eyes of ABC competitor, which you mentioned? Yeah. Sure. And I can give you a sense of how they think about things? Absolutely. Great. So when they hop onto the platform, when they hop on here, the way they're thinking about this is this way. Because the problems that they told us they wanna solve is this. So when they come on here, look, they're looking at this, looking at that. And as you can see, they're getting a sense of the landscape. They're getting a sense of this, of that, and that's how they're thinking about this part of the platform. I'll pause there. I'm curious to what extent you can relate to that. I wanna take as much pressure as I possibly can off of the account executive. So there's by nature more pressure on the account executive to, quote, unquote, sell or show value when it's just me saying, hey, Arman. So what you can do here is this. What you can do here is that the way it would benefit you is this. Okay. That's slightly more pressure on me to show you the value than it would be to show you how somebody else sees the value. That's less pressure on me. So I try to reduce as reduce as much pressure as possible on the account executives. And, of course, from the prospect's perspective, you know, based on the herd theory, the more they can see other companies, especially in their space, especially a competitor. The way they're thinking about things, the more they're gonna have FOMO and, some sort of healthy jealousy that they might be missing out. Can you tell me more about this the demo is just an excuse to do more discovery thing? Because I'm advanced enough as a seller to know I shouldn't just be stopping every six minutes and saying, any questions? Nope. Okay. Any questions? What sort of questions are you asking in your demo so that you get world class discovery through the lens of a demo. So I'll give an obvious question, which is based on what we're looking at, how does this compare to what you're doing right now? Fine. You know, a lot of people know that question. Another question is, you know, I'll pause here. I'm curious, Arman. Where might you see this fitting in your current workflow? Right? So there's the how. There's the where. There's the who. Nick, who on your team would you say would be using this part of the platform the most? Oh, Bobby. Bobby would definitely use this the most because of this. And who knows what they're gonna say? They might say, oh, by the way, and Sarah could also benefit from it. And when the, of course, when the prospects are talking to each other oh, so yeah. Bobby. Oh, yeah. Sarah. Oh, yeah. Tony. That's, like, that's magic. That's Disney World. You know? That's that's the best. That's that's what I'm ultimately going for. Of course, some of the questions that I mentioned earlier, at the beginning of the demo, right, at the beginning of the demo, I'm always going to go over what we spoke about last. Right? Oh, I'm always going home. Armand, so is it right if we just go over a a bit of our conversation laugh from last week just to make sure we're on the same page here? Sure. So you mentioned that these are your top priorities. These are these are some things that you're struggling with. Did I get anything wrong? Right. I'm focusing on the negative. I like to focus on the negative. Did I get anything wrong here? Am I missing anything? Right. As opposed to did I get everything right? Like saying, was there was there anything I got wrong? And then they'll they'll search for something that I got wrong because I brought it up. They say no. No. Great. Then I might do do some permission based asking. Is there I maybe I ask two or three questions about some of the things that I was thinking a lot about this over the past week, and I wrote them down. Would it be okay if I ask me two or three questions about it? Sure. And now I'm now I'm running more discovery even before I start the demo with really curious questions. For example, Arman, I I couldn't help but but wonder, you mentioned all all of these issues. I totally forgot to ask, how did you realize these were actually issues in the first place? I'm going home. I mentioned this on, I think, a different episode. I'm bringing the past to the present. Or I might add, oh, that's interesting. And I use a humbling disclaimer and say, Arman, I I know this might sound like a weird question, but to what extent would you say the team has actually given up on trying to solve this on their own as opposed to hiring someone like us for help? And what's the answer that you're looking for there when you're saying, are you do you want them to have given up? Do you not want them to have given up? And and where do you take it from there? I want a big sigh. If I'm asking a really good question and I hear, you know, I am in. I wanna get as close as I can to some sort of emotional response. You know, we're taught as sales professionals, oh, buying is based on emotion. Okay. That's true. But in my opinion, it's not a 100% based on emotion. Okay. Yeah. We we make decisions based on emotion, and we reason it with logic. Okay. That's great. But at the end of the day, when it comes to closing the deal, we're using logic. Would it make sense? Would it make based on everything we discussed, would it make sense to move forward? Or are there some things that you're not sure about still? That's the neutral disposition, which I talked about earlier. A neutral disposition is always bringing the negative at the end of a question. It's kinda like, hey, Arman, do you wanna go see, Coldplay next week, or, or not really? I'm doing a or not really. Because I don't know what your answer is gonna be, but I wanna give you the opportunity to just tell me the truth. Nah, I don't really wanna go. I'm not into Coldplay. That's cool. So I'm always doing that. One question I also really, really love to ask is, even after the demo, two really good questions that I love asking. I'll say, hey, Nick. You know, based on everything we looked at, I'm not sure how many people have asked you this question. But do do you feel that I have a very good understanding as to what you're looking to accomplish, or do you feel I maybe don't understand you that well? Why do I like asking that? First of all, I wanna know. Second of all, they're gonna really appreciate that question. And if you've developed a really solid effective conversation, they will tell you what you missed, which is great. And the other thing I like to ask is, Arman, you know, based on everything we looked at, I guess, before we look at pricing, to what extent do you believe we have the capability to actually significantly help you? Because, of course, if you don't, we certainly don't have to go over pricing. I'm hearing some phrases that you've said a couple times here. Thinking out loud here, this might sound like a weird question. I'm not sure how many people have asked you this question before. You're almost, like, qualifying what you're saying. I'm curious, like, what technique is that, and what's the intent behind those phrases you're using? It's called the humbling disclaimer. The humbling disclaimer is sharing an insecurity about me to the prospect, basically saying in a in a nice way or in a polished way, the raw form is, I'm scared to ask this, but this is what I wanna ask. Is that cool? And they're gonna save you. Don't worry about it. I wanna help you. It makes them work more, makes me work less, takes the pressure completely off of me. If I wanna ask an impact question, I can literally say, Armand, I'm actually scared to ask you this question because maybe the answer is obvious, and maybe I should know the answer. But can you help me understand what the impact is to the organization if you don't get this solved for? And it lands super, super well, And no one's gonna hate me for asking a question that I really wanna know the answer to that I because I'm curious. As we're speaking about it, part of that is also giving yourself the opportunity to slightly push the prospect away, where going back to that example earlier where there maybe kind of you've maybe you get the sense they're purposely on the phone poking holes or their intentions are not right. You might say, hey, Nick. I'm I'm getting the sense that maybe there are too many holes in our product for us to work together based on the questions that you're asking. I'm guessing maybe this is not for you guys or how am I off there? How are you guys thinking about it? Right. So there are a lot of ways to use these humbling disclaimers, softening statements, and so on and so forth. And I mentioned this in some other conversations, part of the neutral disposition where we're always adding the negative is, hey, Nick. I know you mentioned that you'd be able to send the agreement by the end of day yesterday. If you were me, should I tell my CFO to expect the agreement by today, or is there something else that might prevent us from signing it by today? I'm pointing out the negative because they wanna I wanna bring them to tell me the truth. So they're all interrelated. They apply all over the place. And when it comes to looking for trouble, looking for trouble is a mindset that salespeople should have to always search for what might be wrong. What could they be worried about that they're not saying I'm gonna either beat them to it and bring up the objection, or I'm gonna ask them in a negative way. Is there anything here that you might be concerned about? It sounds like there's a fit, but I was just curious what else you might be thinking that we haven't really talked about. And I'm just gonna go there. The looking for trouble line kinda moves up as the conversations progress. So in the beginning, you're getting to know each other. What do you do? What do we do? This is how we might be able to help. Okay. Maybe they're a little skeptical. You're a little skeptical. Now they're doing the demo. You're there asking questions. You're they're skept more skeptical of you. You're more skeptical of them based on the conversation. And then it comes to the, to the deal. Now there's negotiating. Now the they're really skeptical. Well, we want this. Well, I don't want that. I want this. I want this number. Who's gonna be part of it? When are we gonna get the deal back? And so on and so forth. So I'm all the looking for trouble line is always increasing, but I'm always staying there, always understanding what could be the impediments that in this deal that would prevent us from moving forward. Because that's really the most important thing. And I'm not afraid an account executive should not any account executive should not be afraid to know where they stand at any time. Charles, what a wonderful episode. We're running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question. Final question is this. We've talked about a lot of things salespeople should be doing. Let's talk about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? There is a fine line between asking a direct question and coming across as aggressive. A very simple fix. Some AEs might say, when you say x y z, what do you mean? Okay? Now, obviously, it depends on level of rapport. Okay? Versus, Nick, when you say x y z, how do you mean? How do you mean versus what do you mean makes a very, very big difference. You'll find that when you ask how do you mean, it's gonna feel weird because it's not, like, grammatically correct. But when you say, hey, Nick. When you say this, how do you mean? And it creates a very healthy tension in the conversation where this is gonna boom. They're just gonna open up the floodgates. And it's less aggressive. It's more inviting, than something like what do you mean. So that's just one example of we wanna be direct, but also inviting at the same time. It's kind of like a a magical push pull balance, if you will. So that's what I would say. Beautiful. Charles, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Charles Mulbauer include, number one, if you're getting picked apart on the technical details, try going back to home plate. Go back to the original priorities that you found in discovery and reanchor the demo on those first. Number two, having trouble turning a closed ended question into an open ended question? You can use a simple phrase, like to what extent. Add that to the beginning of any closed ended question, and it will probably become an open ended question. Number three. Here are three types of questions you can ask during a demo to do more demo discovery. Number one, how. How does this compare to what you're doing today? Number two, where where does this fit in your workflow today? And then number three, who who on your team would possibly be using this? And then lastly, number four, based on everything you've seen, what would prevent us from moving forward? Always be looking for trouble in your deal cycles, and don't just continue to set next steps without making sure that you've unblocked the major deal blockers. Alright, Nick. How could people help us out? Well, let's go back to home base here. Every single month, my good friend, my great friend, Armand here, writes up a summary of all of the stuff that he has learned from thirty minutes to Presidents Club in a nice crispy format. And he send that he sends that email. He's kind enough to send that email to a couple listeners. Now if you'd like to be added to that list of the couple listeners who gets a super secret special email from Armond, you might wanna check out the show notes and go subscribe to the thirty minutes to presidents club newsletter. Armond likes to call it a newsy when he's in a particularly playful mood, but please go subscribe. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes to presidents club.
