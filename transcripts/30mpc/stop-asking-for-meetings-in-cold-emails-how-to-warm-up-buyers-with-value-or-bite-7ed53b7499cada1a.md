If you're asking for a meeting, if you're doing a hard pitch, you're spamming. If you're sending people valuable information that should help them, that's not spam to me. That is just, hey. I'm giving. You can take it or leave it. If I wanted to create some content that would essentially warm someone up, right, it would make them aware of the problem or possibly get them to consider solving the problem. What's an example of a problem I would want to make someone aware of and a piece of content that I could create with Chatt GPT? There's something called a pain chain, and a pain chain is a series of challenges that are related to each other that when you string them together, create a narrative. So let's say that I'm in college, and I have to write a two page paper on targeting companies. I might start out with paragraph one about this, then that transitions to paragraph two. Well, all we're gonna do is we're gonna take that paper and bust it up in the small little emails, and we're gonna tell the story over eight to 10 touches, and we're gonna provide value. I don't consider this spamming because if you're asking for a meeting, if you're doing a hard pitch, you're spamming. If you're sending people valuable information that should help them, that's not spam to me. That is just, hey. I'm giving. You can take it or leave it. You know what I mean? Like, somebody the other day left something at my front door. Like, I think it was some Cubs Girl Scout or Girl Scout, and they, like, left me a little teaser or something like that. I'm not gonna buy from them, but, like, I don't consider it rude that they left it. But I would have considered it rude if during dinner, they knock on my door and keep knocking because they can see me in the window until I come up and then ask me if I wanna buy cookies when I'm, like, obviously not ready to buy cookies right now. You know what I'm saying? You find five or six different areas of pain. Like, for example, when your team doesn't have time to do research, you target poorly. When you target poorly, your messaging doesn't have the right kind of solution problem synergy or it doesn't align. When that doesn't align, then you don't get the right type of engagement that you want. Then, therefore, you turn up the volume, and then you end up with a blacklisted, and and email is no longer a viable channel for you. That's a pain chain. Rather than putting all that in one email, each one is a little less than where you can teach somebody. Each one can have a little bit of content. And so the first one would be, like, why don't reps have time to research? Well, I don't know if you know this or not, but, like, the average reply rate's 1%. Buyers demand that that you know more now because they know more about you before they talk. And, therefore, you must spend time researching, but the average rep has 25 deals that spends an hour a week. They don't have enough time to do research. Right? Like, here's a little time study that we did to help you understand why your reps might be struggling with time and maybe some ways that you can clear it up on your own if you have some extra stuff in there to clean up on your own. Then my next email and phone call or whatever is gonna be about, alright. Hey. You know, if you were saw that or we didn't have research, wondering if you're wondering what that means. What means your targeting is gonna be bad because they're not gonna understand they're gonna just pick the logos that they are familiar with or whatever common pitfalls that reps fall into. So that's how I do it, is I create this pain chain that allows me to educate narrative that all connects together that shows multiple angles of value that I can create, and it's helping them make them aware of why they might have a problem that they're unaware of. Have you tested let's assume that you have two prospects of the same, like, caliber of ICP. One gets traditional prospecting type emails where you're just hammering them with meetings. The other gets this nice one, two, three, four, five pain chain. Do you have a sense of how much better the storytelling pain chain converts versus a traditional problem based outbound sequence? Some of the initial evidence we're seeing is a x difference. Because don't forget what we're doing is we're not fishing for replies in meetings in a pain chain. We're looking for can we get them to do something to get value that indicates that they're more mature or they're progressing in their buyer's journey? Once we they download the first thing, then we move them to aware. Now we know they're aware. Now let's create content that says, I might wanna consider this, like, buyer's guide or, you know, feature parity matrix or whatever. Right? Now they're considering, and then that's when we hit them for the meeting. We won't might not get a huge reply rate or whatever for that early pain chain education, But what we're doing though is we're now moving those people getting signals and moving them into a direct sync. So when we're asking for the meeting, we're getting it a lot more frequently than when we're sending it just blasting out to everybody. And we lost over the last two decades our rigor of testing. And so that's what we're trying to bring people back to is in today's thing where we've just we can send any idea anytime we want to mass blast everybody and there's so much noise, why don't we slow down and, first of all, assess where they're at? Once we assess where they're at, then we can take the appropriate action to start moving them further down their buyer's journey. And I think that that's a step that most people are forgetting, but that is buried in our sales roots. We just have to dig it back out. I mean, I think with today's tech stack, if you're a sales leader or rep listening, you can build this yourself. So step one is I'm going to define who has the most problems for the most value. That's step one. Right? Yep. Step two, I probably have a couple of basic sequences for those personas or those types of problems that are focused on unaware messaging. So I have my five step unaware pain chain Mhmm. Where I'm just, like, five emails that are citing problem after problem after problem and just educating them on that problem and serving up content. And within each of those emails, I can have a data report or an insight or something that they can click on, and I can usually track clicks. And then if I'm doing this, like, poor man style, like, hammer and nail in prospecting, what I'm doing is every single day when I open up my prospecting tasks, I'm starting with anyone who's opened an email more than three times or has clicked on one of the links in the email. And when that happens, I have a decision where I can either choose to make a cold call, I can choose to drop that sequence and put them into an aware sequence, And I can do some of this stuff manually, or I can send a one off message outside of the traditional sequence. But you can do that. Essentially, what you're doing is you're educating them on the problem until they click something or they open something a couple of times, and that's when you're going in for the kill, AKA you're asking for the meeting. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
