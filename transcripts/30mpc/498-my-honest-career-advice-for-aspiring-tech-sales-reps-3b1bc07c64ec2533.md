## Transcript

We're gonna be answering your burning sales career questions, everything from how to land your dream job, to how to get promoted faster, to the traits that separate the president's club sellers from the rest of the pack. And along the way, we'll draw on my experience as a VP of sales and Nick's experience as a number one enterprise seller who's now running our full sales team. So this first category is gonna be focused on everything related to interviews and getting a job, the hiring process. Yeah. So the first one comes from Todd l, and Todd asked, how do I stand out in a competitive sales interview process? So when I think about this question, there are two parts of standing out in an interview process. One is even getting the interview in the first place. And then the second is when you're in the interview process, how do you nail an interview? The biggest problem today is even getting an interview at all. And a lot of times, what I see people doing is they're spraying and praying job applications. You can send out 80 job applications with, like, LinkedIn easy apply. There are literally, like, AI job appliers. And I'm gonna be honest. We listed some sales roles the other day. We got over a 100 applications in a day. Dude, I got a thousand. It's ridiculous. And I was screening for a role myself. You wanna know how many people actually sent a direct email or cold called me? Three? Two. Oh, two people. And I responded to both of them. I got so overwhelmed with the pile of 80 plus applications that I got in one day. Imagine if someone put 80 pieces of paper on your desk in one day. You'd be like, what the hell? Just take the other channel. Reach out to them over the phone. Send them a LinkedIn DM. Send them an email. Show them that you can sell your way into the interview process. That's number one. Number two is take the backdoor. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. The number one thing that I will do if I'm trying to get a sales job is I'm gonna go and connect with all of the reps on the sales team, and I'm gonna ask them for an introductory chat. And I'm gonna say something like, hey. I just applied for the AE role at this company. It seems like you've done really well because of x, y, and z. Could I bug you for a fifteen minute Zoom coffee and just ask you about your perspective going into those interviews? And nine times out of 10, if you run that pre coffee interview chat with a rep, well, you can just say like, hey. I know there's usually a way for people to flag internal resumes. Is there any way you could get me on the radar or recruiter? And nine times out of 10, if you ask semi decent questions, they will always say yes. There's another question from Kira h, and this question is, how do I sell myself effectively during a sales interview? So this one's gonna be a novel skill for a lot of salespeople, which is discovery. Figure out what the other person cares about. And where you're going to do this is usually in a sales interview. The sales leader is gonna set some sort of agenda where they'll say, hey. You know, this is meant to be a first interview. Get to know each other a little bit. I'll have a couple questions for you. I'm sure you'll have some for me at the end, and then we'll talk about next steps at the end. So they'll set some sort of agenda. In response to that, you need to add to their agenda, and you can say, great. That sounds good to me. I guess before we get into things, I have one question for you, which is I was doing some prep for this, and I went deep on the role. And my take is you're probably looking for somebody that is a really aggressive prospector or has strong discovery skills or whatever you think they care about. But then just ask them directly, but my guess is, like, you have a very particular set of skills and qualities that you're looking for in this hire, and I wanna make sure that I'm highlighting those things as we talk through things today. So I guess before we get into your questions, do you mind sharing a little bit about what you're looking for in this role? Now what happens is you get the answers to the test. You figure out what they actually care about and what it takes to pass this interview. And now when you answer all of the subsequent questions, you're able to answer them in a way that highlights how you match what they're looking for. The other thing is when you start answering interview questions, I find that the biggest place that sellers screw up is they either ramble around in circles or they give me general ideas that are not tactical or that I sniff, and I'm like, this person doesn't actually know their stuff. So the best counter to that is whenever you have an interview question that's throwing your way, answer it in steps plus one example. So I'll give you an example. Someone's like, okay. How do you cold call? I'm gonna say, like, alright. Let's break down the cold call into three steps. First is I'm gonna lead with a context based opener, then I'm gonna lead with a problem as my pitch, not a value prop, And then I usually use three steps to handle any objection with what I call the mister Miyagi method. So I'll, like, start with the opener. Here's what that might sound like. Right? And that's the one example. So break it down into steps and give one example. Same thing for deals. If someone's asking you about your sales process, break your sales process down into steps, and then give one example of where a deal would fall through each of those steps. Do not answer in rambling orders, and don't be afraid to take a beat on a question and be like, can I just, like, compose my thoughts on this one? Because I wanna give you a more thoughtful answer before just jumping right in. Well, to add on to that cold calling example, if a leader asks you to talk to me about how you think about cold calling, you do not need to give the exhaustive everything you know about cold calling. On a scale of one, which is no answer to 10, sharing everything that you possibly know, maybe you go to, like, a two or three and then let them know, I'm happy to share more on my philosophy and the way that I approach that if you would like. So dose your answers because sometimes they don't need the deep dive, and that actually is a distraction from the other things that you need to get to in the interview. So this next one brings us to the very end of the interview, Arman. It comes from Zach h, and he goes, what kind of questions should I be asking at the very end of a sales interview? Three types of questions that I like to ask and then one category to avoid until the very end. So the three types of questions I like to ask are sales day of the life questions, leadership decision questions, and then closing questions. So the art to asking good questions at the end of the interview is the quality of your questions should continue to sell you as a candidate in addition to exploring the questions that you have as a seller. So I'll give you an example. If I wanted to ask a sales day in the life question, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna literally put myself in the shoes of an AE and ask myself, what does the day of a life of a seller look like at this company, and what do I think would be the hardest part? And I'm gonna ask a question about about that. So when I was interviewing at Carta, I looked up all of their competitors that were ripping on Carta when I was Google searching them, and I was saying, like, hey. I looked up two or three competitors, and I noticed they were saying x, y, and z about Carta, And it looks like they're half the price. And I'm curious, like, how do you go about handling someone who's, like, half the price? And that shows that I did my research, but it also shows that I'm putting myself in the shoes of a seller, and it gives them the chance to tell me a little bit about what the deal cycle is actually like. So that's number one. If I wanna ask a leadership decision question, I'm gonna interview this person as if I was interviewing a sales manager. So one of my favorite questions to ask is, I'm curious for you. There have probably been moments when you've seen your sales team in, like, a negative rut. How do you go about injecting the life back in your sales team without just pounding the table more and more and more and demanding more from them? And that gives them the chance to start selling themselves as a leader. And when people start feeling like they're also being evaluated, what it does is it subconsciously elevates your status in the eye of the leader because they're not the only ones who are evaluating you. You're the ones who are also evaluating them. And then the third one is, like, the glorious closing question, which is there's a lot of conventional sales advice that say that you need to close your interview. In other words, ask for the business. And I don't always agree with it honestly, but the problem is there are enough old school sales leaders who want you to close your interviews, so you might as well close your interviews. And And so when you're closing an interview, what you wanna do is you wanna ask someone, did you get the business? So the way you do that is you just ask something like, hey. I've really enjoyed this conversation. I've learned things like x y z. Can I ask you a somewhat direct question before we go? They'll say yes to be like, usually at this point in the process, you sort of know where I stand, and I'm curious for you. Do you have any open reservations about me as a candidate? And if you do, I would love to just hear them now so that one, I can learn and two, if possible, I can address them directly. And they'll usually give you, like, a tongue in cheek smile and nod where, like, you know to close your interview, and they might give you one or two things, or they'll tell you you passed on the spot. Alright. So the second category is all about promotions and accelerating your career trajectory. So this first question comes from Dylan b, and it's, when do you know if it's time to move on or stay in the same sales role? AK, should I quit my job? So there's four categories I would think about when you're evaluating whether or not you should actually move on from your sales job. And those four categories are learning, earning, growing, and connection. Learning is, are you learning more about the craft of sales? Are you continuing to progress from a skill development perspective? Earning is, are you making the money that you want to or not? Growing is, are you moving up in your career? Did you go from SDR to SMB AE? Did you go from SMB AE to commercial AE? Are you moving up on the ladder? And then the last one is connection, which is like Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busywork like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Is this team a team that, like, you want to be a part of, one that fills you up and pushes you to grow in lots of places beyond just sales, or is it coworkers that you can tolerate? Generally, if two of those four things are bad, you're almost never gonna land in a sales job where all four of those things are a 100% you love. If two of the four are bad, it might mean that, like, you're making good money and you're moving up in the career, but you don't like your team and you're not really learning and getting better as a seller, which means you're gonna stall out your career. So I would look at those four criteria. And if three of the four are good, I'd probably stick around a little bit longer. If only two are good, probably time to start moving on. There are a couple, like, common mistakes or nuances on this one. The first is the most common career mistake I see people make is they get a role that's, like, a 10% OTE or compensation bump, and they take that when they are still learning a ton. They're growing. They're on a hot track to be promoted, and they're connecting with people, and they love their team. Those are the three hardest things to find. You can almost always find a half decent OTE if you're getting paid market rate, but it's really hard to find a place where you're learning, you're around people that you actually like being around, and you're on a path to be promoted. And then what happens is every time you switch companies, you have to learn a new territory. You have to learn the internal capital, and you can actually expect your overall attainment to go down when you join a new company because you don't have street cred yet. You're probably not getting as good of a territory as you had at your old company because you haven't been there long enough. And, also, you're just, like, not as good at that job yet. So it takes time to get good. And so oftentimes, leading for, like, a 10 k comp bump does not make sense. So that's, like, the first piece. The other piece that I'll add is at different points in your career, these four things might not all be held equal. So if you're an SDR and you're optimizing for a five k comp increase, like, one job is giving you a 75 k OTE, another job is giving you an 80 k OTE. But the 75 k role is a place where you know you're gonna learn. You know you're gonna get promoted to AE. People are clearly making that jump. The team is doing well, and you're surrounded by people that you're gonna call on when you're 30. Like, take that job. The five k doesn't matter. Because when you're an enterprise AE, you're gonna be trying to make $600, and that's, like, half a percent of your comp plan versus when you're an enterprise AE and you've been at this game for, like, ten years, at that point, honestly, like, you've got the chance to make a 7 figure w two, and you wanna pick a company that has a killer product where you have a really good territory. Because if you can't attain an enterprise, it's the difference between making a 150 k and making a million dollars in a year. So that's what I would think about is, like, think about what's most important in your career. Early on, it's like the learning, the growing, the meeting people. Later on, it's the earnings. Alright. So the text one comes from Brecken b who says, what's the typical career trajectory of a salesperson? Yeah. So the the typical career trajectory is sales is one of the only paths in the world where you can stay as an individual contributor or rep, where you're not leading people. And you can actually make more money doing that than you can as a leader. So the individual contributor track goes as follows. Usually, in tech sales, you'll start as a sales development representative where you're basically cold calling people, cold emailing people, and you're trying to get them to book a meeting. Once you get promoted from sales development representative, you typically start as an SMB account executive or small medium business account executive, where you're taking meetings. You're probably doing some prospecting still, and you're closing smaller accounts usually under $10,000 in deal size. Then you get into the mid market, and that's usually when you're a mid market account executive. You're closing 5 figure deals, so between $10.50 k, maybe high 5 figure sometimes. And then once you get into enterprise, you're closing over 6 figure deals. You're an enterprise accounting executive, etcetera. At any point in time, you can take any of those roles and take them a step up, and you can be a manager. So for example, you could be an SDR manager. You could be an SMB AE manager. You could be a mid market AE manager. You could be an enterprise AE manager. And that's usually you're managing one team of reps between five to 10 reps total, usually. The next layer above manager is you go director where you're usually managing teams of teams. So if I'm an SMB director, I might manage two SMB teams. Or if I'm a general director, I might manage an SMB and a mid market team. And then VP of sales usually manages the whole organization, And a CRO, a chief revenue officer usually manages the whole organization which is just a bigger sales organization or sometimes they take over customer success marketing depending on your org. Now here's the thing. When do you actually make the jump of those trajectories? So usually my recommendation is before you become a manager, I highly recommend you get some form of closing experience. So try to at least get from sales development representative to account executive before you go into leadership. And the reason for this is, let's say that you go from SDR to SDR manager. It's gonna get really hard to become a VP of sales eventually. If you have never closed, you're never really gonna get that street cred from the a e's who are like, yeah, but you've, like, never actually closed deals yourself. The exception of the rule is if you know you love sales development, SDR world, still probably try to get some closing experience because then you can teach your SDRs to be closers. But if you know that's what you like, go be an SDR leader and then follow that track up. And sometimes the SDR leadership route can actually lead you to, like, a chief marketing officer route. But it's a slightly different career path from the AE manager, AE director, VP of sales rep. So this next one on that note is from Maggie Brown, and the question is, what is your best advice for switching from a BDR to account executive, and how do I do it? Yeah. So there's a couple different things that you wanna do if you wanna make that jump. The first one is it's pretty obvious, but, like, you should be performing consistently. You should be hitting and exceeding your quota month over month over month. If you're not hitting your numbers when you're an SDR, it's gonna be really, really hard to trust you with closing deals when you also have to prospect on top of that. So first one is, like, you should just be performing. Number two is start to do the next job. And I'm not saying that you should be going on and closing deals for your AE, but you should be putting together prep notes for your AE before their discovery calls. You might be the one who sends the agenda in advance. You might be the one who joins the beginning of the call with your AE, and you set the agenda instead of them. So start to do some of the things that you're gonna do in your next job because that will help you build those skills, and now you start to build an an AE who's gonna advocate for you. The next one, and this is probably the biggest, which is you need to make sure that your boss and the folks who are overseeing the AEs, the directors of sales or the sales managers, know that you want to become an AE. And if I'm you, you go have those conversations live with the sales managers. And you say, hey. Wanted to have a conversation with you because I know I'm really, really focused on the SDR job. I love working with Armond. He's, like, one of my favorite leaders, and I'm doing really, really well here. But I want you to know one of my goals is, like, I wanna become an AE, and I would love to be on your team. And I don't know if you have openings right now, but when you do, like, I'm wondering if we can't could have a conversation about if I might be right for that role. And when you let them know this is where I want to go and you have that conversation early, you start to become somebody who is on their radar. And the last piece here is once you get on their radar, you should stay on their radar. So if you've told a sales manager that you want to be an AE on their team, you've got to almost nurture drip them while you're waiting for a role to open up. So I would do things like, share wins with them if you book a really, really big account or if you put together a new sequence for your team that increases response rate or you help onboard somebody on the SDR team. Start sharing those wins as a mechanism to stay top of mind so when a role does open up, you're their first pick. Whenever I was looking at an SDR who was up for promotion to AE, I would ask three questions. Number one, are they hitting their number? And a lot of people think to Nick's point that if I'm hitting my number, like, that gets me the job. That's just like your entry ticket to even be allowed to interview. Number two is are you ready for the next job? And a lot of times, there are SDRs who are really good at cold calling. They're good at cold email, but they cannot run a mock discovery. And if you are not practicing mock discos before you get in the AE interview process, you're probably not gonna get it. And then the third is I'm always thinking about, am I setting a good cultural precedent by promoting this person? In other words, are you contributing to the team trainings like Nick said? Are you someone who's, like, bending the ROEs, or are you a lone wolf on the team? Are you someone where I can point to and be like, if you wanna be promoted, be like that person? If the answer is no, you probably need to act like a better teammate on your org. Alright. So this next one comes from Hazel, and she says, what are the bad habits you see in sales professionals that lead to stalling their career? Picking shitty companies or hopping too often. Those are the two biggest mistakes I see people make. So number one, a lot of times, people will get distracted by a shiny OTE and all, like, look at the company, and it's funded by, like, the worst investors in the world. They've been stuck at, like, 20 employees, and they're not growing forever. But they'll sell them on the founder vision of, like, oh, it's a small team. You'll have so much responsibility. We need someone like you, and they'll win you on Ego. And then what will happen is you'll get into a company, and the company is stuck. And so then you end up being stuck. The deals don't close easy. The territory sucks. The product sucks. You never end up making your OTE, and you never get promoted because the sales team isn't growing because the company is not growing. So number one, stop picking shitty companies. The number one thing that you can do to stop picking shitty companies is we'll put a link to the CB Insights smart money investor list. It's the list of the top venture capital firms in The United States. If you are looking at a tech company or a venture backed startup that is not backed by one of those investors, do not work for the company. That's easy. Number two is you can just ask or back channel on team attainment. If you don't have a team where at least half of the reps are hitting quota and the overall blended average attainment is not 70 plus percent, then you are on a losing locker room team, and you are going to be fighting to be the number one rep where the number one rep hits 60% of quota. So don't work for shitty companies. That's number one. Number two, a lot of people constantly get to the top of an org, and they see a 10 k OTE bump, and they jump to the next company. And they would have been 10 times better off just waiting an extra three months for the promotion instead of jumping in the next promotion because what compounds year over year is the quality of your territory and the quality of your street cred. So when I look at the AEs who've made VP or enterprise sales the quickest, they usually have one or two promotions at a really great company. And then at that point, for example, they go from SDR to SMB to mid market. And at that point, they're like, I'm hot here. I'm just gonna stay. Or they're like, okay. To go from mid market to enterprise, I've really gotta be at, like, an enterprise ready company. So I'm gonna make that big jump to this company, and then I'm gonna go spend another three or four years at that company where I can also pick a good company where I can accelerate my career trajectory. But the people who end up, like, going circles in their career is they're at a company for, like, one year. They don't get promoted, and they go to the next company, and they're an SDR for another year. And they're like these serial SDRs or these, like, serial SMB or mid market AEs because they never actually give themselves enough time to get promoted and get hot at a company. And then what happens is later on in their career, they're completely unhirable because they have 10 short stints, and no one wants to bring them on board. Alright. So this next one comes from Camilla s, and she asked, my daughter does not have any previous sales experience, and she doesn't have a college degree, but she wants to get an SDR role. What would you recommend she do? Yeah. So there there are two paths here. Path number one is you take the boot camp path where there are SDR boot camps that will teach you everything you need to be a sales development representative for three, six months, and you sort of get this, like, stamp of approval certification that's, like, good enough to at least go to a company and be like, hey. I'm, like, SDR ready. Path number two is you just sort of go at it, but you network the heck out of your way in and you pre prepare your sales toolkit because the bar for you to get that job is gonna be way higher. The reality is there are gonna be a lot of companies that are just full stop. I'm only hiring people with college experience. But I personally have hired multiple SDRs who do not have college degrees. They either have associate degrees or they don't have a degree at all. But those people, the reason that I hired them is because, number one, they were able to translate their previous work experiences, whether it was internships or door to door selling or solar selling or whatever it was, into this is how I could be a great tech SDR. And then number two, they had listened to a million sales podcasts, and they read tech sales books, and they knew the basic fundamentals of how to cold call, how to email, and it was very, very clear that they had put in the work to create their own education. So that's step number one is create your own education. Step number two is network the heck out of your way in. I talked about this a little bit earlier. Anytime you're going after a team, you cannot mass spray and pray because you have a resume that is designed to be disqualified because you don't have a piece of paper. And that's okay, but you have to take the backdoor in. So I would go and I would reach out to the top five reps at every single company that you're applying for, send in your resume, and just tell them, hey. I just applied to this company. I've been practicing my cold call opener for your company, and I wanted to see if there was any way that you would give me some feedback on it. It. And an AE who wants to bring on hungry SDR to their team will take that call four out of five times. And at the end, you can just have them make the introduction of the recruiter, and that's how you bypass the screen. And the last one is from Johnny p, which is what advice do seasoned AEs have for someone just starting? Yeah. So if you just started an AE role, I've got three big buckets. The first one is recognize, accept, and own the fact that you are going to need to work harder than a seasoned AE does to get to the same level of performance. And the reason for that is somebody who is seasoned, they might close one in five deals that they talk to. So they talk to five people. They close one of those deals. You're not gonna be that good. You might need to talk to eight people to close a deal, which means you need to talk to so many more, which means you need to prospect more, you need to have more meetings, you need to prep more. There's more work that you're gonna need to do, and you should just accept and own that. Do not think you can show up and leave at the same time as a top performer and get the same results because you're not yet there skill wise. So that's number one. It's just like it's a work ethic thing that you have to accept. Number two, to the point of those top performers, you don't need to reinvent the wheel. You just need to be able to replicate in your own style the things that they are doing. So I would go look at the sales emails of the top performers that your org are sending, watch the call recordings of their discovery calls and of their demos, follow their deal paths. Who are they talking to in their deal cycle? What steps are they bringing in? What solutions engineers are they involving in the deals? See if you can spot the patterns and the best practices that they are following, and then just replicate that for yourself. And then the last piece is if you're working at a pace that you need to to make up for that skill gap, if you are starting to map to the skills of those top performers, the last piece is starting to close that skill gap even more by owning your own self education. And there's two things that you need to be focused on from a self education perspective as an AE. One is sales skills, and there's ton of great sales, YouTube pages, podcasts, books. Go pick some of that stuff up and start to learn the craft of sales beyond just what your manager is saying. But the other piece, and this is actually a place I think a lot of salespeople miss, is they don't self educate on the space that they are in. So when I sold accounting software to law firms, like, I would go read legal accounting profitability calculation blogs, which were, like, the most boring thing in the world, but it taught me, like, the insider language and the jargon. So when I sat down with the law firm CFO, I sounded like I belonged. And so if I'm you, go start to build your industry content diet of the podcast you're gonna listen to, the books you're gonna read, the newsletters you're gonna follow so you can start to speak the language of the people that you are talking to. If you hit on those three buckets, the work ethic, the shadowing of the top performers, and the self education in both sales and industry stuff, I promise you, you are going to dramatically accelerate your career trajectory. So, folks, if you wanna accelerate your career trajectory right now, we have three awesome resources for you. They're all free. We have our ultimate cold calling framework if you're trying to get better at prospecting, our ultimate discovery call framework if you're trying to get better at running that first sales call, and then our ultimate sales process if you're really trying to level up and manage multistage deals and bring them from open all the way through close. You can get those three right around here or down in the show notes, and we'll see you on the next one.
