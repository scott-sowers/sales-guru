## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Troke, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today was one of those days where we got off the recording and we said, holy cow. This is why we do this thing. It's the one and only, the enterprise director of sales. It's Marissa Bell from Figma. Nick, why should people listen? Marissa does a phenomenal job holding her customer accountable. And so if you're a salesperson who feels like you're doing most of the work, the majority of the work, you're dragging the deal along. Marissa has some really good ways to engage economic buyers, make sure your customer does the stuff that they need to do to get the deal to the finish line. And so we're gonna have to have her back for a round two eventually. Three two one. Here's round one. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Marissa. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Sounds good. My first actionable takeaway is being in integrity with Medic. Meaning, it is really important in Medic to make sure you have the right who saying the proper what. Medic is all about who is saying what, and that is what is driving your deal forward. And so it's critical as a rep that you're going into your deals and thinking about who is telling you the information. If someone who is two people below the line is telling you something, it is probably not actually the information you wanna hear from the proper what. So going into your deals, identifying who is saying the information is critical to making sure you keep your deals on track. Beautiful. What's number two? The second one is it's important to go back to basics in your deals. What I find is there are so many tips that we're learning as sales reps, which is really awesome to progress our deals forward. And as a result of that, we sometimes miss the basics. And so there are four things I recommend my reps keep in mind on all of their deals. First is always set an agenda. Second is hold introductions when relevant. Third is always schedule a next call while you are on the current call. And the fourth is remembering to schedule a weekly call with your champion as you're progressing your deals forward. Beautiful. What's number three? Rent us out. The third one is never lose a deal alone and never win a deal alone. We know the data tells us that when you work with a team, you close bigger deals and you close them faster. And what I found is our best reps leverage all the resources around them. And it doesn't stop at just their manager. It can be their sales engineer, their PMM team. It could be their legal team. We just had a call with our legal team yesterday with a customer, and we were trying to schedule the next step, and the customer denied us. And then our legal team requested the call again and said, hey. I have my calendar open. I'm happy to do any time that works for you. And they locked in a three hour call with us for the next week. So it's really powerful to leverage your team, and don't forget that you have people around you to help you out. Awesome. So, Marissa, first question for you. Let's go back to the whole concept of being integrity with Medic, in particular, getting the right person to validate what you need to get a deal done. So oftentimes, what'll happen is I might get involved with a frontline manager in the marketing team. Right? And they're gonna give me what I think is all of Medic. They're gonna be like, this is the biggest pain in the world. We have budget for this thing. I know how to get this deal done. What do I do in that moment when I think I might be getting a story that sounds like buying signal, but it's coming from the wrong person in the organization? It is tempting when a customer is giving you time to wanna give it back to them, but it is critical to ask yourself, do they carry influence, and do they have any authority within their organization? And so it is important to test the person and see if they actually can help you move your deal forward. And if not, know that. Like, if they are your coach or they are someone else in the organization that can provide insight into your deal, that's fine. But it's important for you as the rep to know that and set the proper expectations with yourself to know how this person can be used as a part of the deal. And so if you built up this relationship with the person, you can ask them, hey. Have you bought products in the past before? Or who ultimately signs off on this product? Or, hey. In the past, I when we've gone through legal reviews, we've typically had to negotiate on indemnity and liability caps. How has your team handled that in the past? Like, getting really specific and asking about the process and if they don't have the answers. And hopefully by now, if you built a relationship or you've built up enough pain and they know that this is something they wanna move forward with, they'll give you the recommendation. And you as the rep should probably be doing account planning on the back end and thinking who who else could be a part of this conversation. And if you're starting to sense that this person you're talking to doesn't have the answers, you can ask, like, hey. How is x a part of this process? And, hopefully, they can give you some insight. So when I was a rep, I remember my manager would ask me all these questions in a pipeline review, and I would just start to sweat, and then I would walk away. And, eventually, I realized that there was a pattern to their questions of things that were they were looking for as hot spots in deal. And I was able to reverse engineer my sales process based on the questions that they were asking me that would oftentimes blow up a deal. So, Marissa, if we take a step back, you're a director of enterprise sales over at Figma. I'm curious. Are there certain hot spots in a deal that you will consistently poke into with your reps that reps listening right now can take and implement into their sales process? Yes. I definitely do. I have three. And it and I would say my three are dependent on what we're seeing at Figma. And so your three could be different for your company. Figma is a product led growth company. We are blessed with people who love our product. And because of that, we typically are hurt by the fact that we're talking to coaches versus champions. And so for us, the three things I look at are, do we actually have a champion, someone who has influence and authority? That's the first one. The second is, do we have an EB? And not just do we know the person's name, but this is the integrity with Medic Peace. It is have we actually met them, whether it's on a phone call or they've responded to an email. And the third is the decision process. Specifically, do we have a mutual plan in place that is agreed upon by the customer, and we are saying we are both signing by this date? If we don't have those three things, and I will always ask those three things, then I know we just have a little bit more work to do, and that's fine. The white space is fine. This is then the compass for what we need to go track down next, but those are the three things that I that I always ask about. So, Marissa, let's talk about that first bucket, which is fascinating, and then I wanna go to the e b bucket. So a lot of people will say, I have a champion. Right? And the reason they'll say I have a champion is because they can influence a decision in theory. That term gets bastardized at times because in theory, a marketing analyst can influence a decision that is made at the CMO level, but their likelihood of influencing that decision is extremely, extremely low. So can you unpack how you know if someone is both influential and authoritative in an organization? Yep. I think I can give a specific deal we're working on now where they have proven that they are a champion. The first is they are always willing to hop on a call and specifically, like, commit to a weekly call and then also do ad hoc calls. So that's the first. The second that differentiates potentially a coach from a champion is they are willing to bring in their boss, and that is so powerful. The third is they are able to set calls with cross functional members to attend that call. And for this deal in specific, there were probably 20 people on this call that we had yesterday because the champion put his neck out to do it, and they did it for him. That was so huge. I'd say those are three big ones. There's other ones on, like, if they know the process and you can test them. Those are, like, the most immediate that are easy to do today. You can say, hey. Who else is a part of this process? Hopefully, they know. Okay. Great. Let's set a call with them as we're working towards getting this finalized. So that's a really big call. 20 people on a call. And I have to imagine that the way that you prepare for that call and the way that you run that call is quite different than a first discovery call where you're one on one with somebody. So can you tell me about the prep and then the way that you run that 20 person big call? Yes. I am big on always have an intended outcome for every call you have. I am big, big on that. I think it's critical, not only for yourself when you bring in other people to join your call as well. So for us, we had an intended outcome we needed to have coming out of this call, which was let's schedule a next call that was this three hour, like, red line deep dive with this customer. So that was one. The second, in terms of prep, is make sure you're aware of the time because it is gonna go by quickly when you have 20 people on a call and you only have thirty minutes. It's likely you're gonna get off track. The third that we thought about is, like, let's just dive into it. Let's not do the, like, 20 people introduce themselves. Like, that eats into so much of the call. So I think the prep piece is really key. And then when you're on the call, there for this particular call, it was to review, like, high level red lines. So it different than maybe, like, if you're doing a discovery or, like, a presentation with an EV with 20 people. In this particular one, we had teed up our champion. Our champion was in lockstep with what needed to happen on this call. So that helped us get right into it. And then what the rep did really well is fifteen minutes into the call said, hey. Fifteen minute time check. And then when we had ten minutes left, hey. We have ten minutes left. And when there were three minutes left, say, hey. Like, we have three minutes left. And when we have three minutes left, we started talking about next steps. And we did that when we were on the current call. So those were just some things about this one that went really well, and it all comes down to the prep and then executing on the plan when you're actually with everyone. So this is also one way that team selling is critical. Because my guess is you are not one v 20 taking on that room on your own. My guess is you have a sales engineer who's probably running demo, and you're working the room. Can you talk about how you work that room and what that overall team selling dynamic feels like in that 20 person meeting? Yep. On this particular one, there were five of us on our side. Only two people spoke live on the call. But I will say on the back end, we are in a team Slack channel, literally Slacking, Volleying, being like, hey. You take this. Or, like, when we are saying something, we're, like, hyping the person up being like, you are, like, you are a rock star. You got this. Because that's just stressful when you're in this environment and you wanna, like, boost the people up around you. So I think that part is key. I've also seen reps literally texting track? The trust that you build with your cross functional members is key, and not taking it for granted, and then explaining the why it was so impactful afterwards. A legal person asking their counterpart legal person on the customer side for a call is so much more powerful than a salesperson asking for that call. And us explaining the why behind that to our partners is so key because they wanna help you out. We're all on the same team, and so, yep, I think that part is really important. Just to bring this full circle as a rep, I feel like my job is to pull the customer in to the conversation and push my team strategically into the conversation as well. And so pulling the customer in looks like engaging key people in the room who are sitting quiet because I know who's important in that deal cycle. But, Marissa, to your point earlier, you talked about getting your legal team to ask for next steps. There are certain things that, as a rep, I know I need to ask for. But if you have your Slack open, I will ping someone else to ask for it because it comes out more meaningful. So I'll ping the legal person to push for that call just like you mentioned. Or you might ping your engineer to talk about something technical even if you know the answer. But because it comes from someone technical and not a seller, it sounds way better and people actually trust the message. And so, Marissa, oftentimes, what'll happen towards the end of this call is it gets a little bit tricky because you have a 20 person call. You have a bunch of people from your side. Ten minutes in, you're probably slacking your sales engineer or whoever it is saying like, hey, folks. Time check. I need at least five minutes to do a debrief at the end. How do you wrap up this massive call with 20 people? Yep. I think a lot of it is rooted in hard pivots, but the way you can do that is by expressing gratitude and saying, hey. Thank you all so much for the conversation with just about five minutes left. I know the point of the call today was to go through x y z thing. I wanna make sure we can talk about some next steps or talk about these other things that we talked about as a goal of the call at the top of this time together. So let's go into that. And if we need to find more time to discuss what we have just been talking about, let's let's do that as well. But I think it's expressing gratitude, being comfortable to disrupt, and then moving forward with what you need to do because you have to stay in the driver's seat on your deal, and you you have to do what you need to do on that call. So let's just pretend that this call has ended, and I've done a good job. I have a champion. I don't have a coach, and I do a debrief call with my champion. My guess is you need to understand how that call went and start to understand what else is left to unblock. Can you talk about the post big team call debrief with your champion and what should be covered there? Yeah. I think you you ask how they thought it went, and then you get their honest understanding of based off of everything you've heard, and we've talked about this mutual plan in place to get this done by x date, where do you think we are? And you kinda map out all the remaining things, which is why MEDDIC or whatever qualification framework you have at your company is so critical. It literally is the blueprint. It's simple, but it's really robust. And so if you can help your champion understand what's left because they might not know either, especially for a PLG company, or any company. Like, oftentimes, these champions have never bought something before. They need you to guide them. That's the role of a salesperson is you are their guide. And so I think you you get their honest understanding of how the call went. You ask what the conversations were like. You express your gratitude for their support, and then you map out the rest of the things that need to happen in the process and make sure you're on track to do that. This might happen earlier in your sales process, but you previously talked about doing weekly meetings with your champion. And I'm wondering if you can explain how do you introduce the concept of that to your champion, having a reoccurring meeting, and then what you actually do in those weekly meetings? What's the agenda for those? Yep. Once you are at a certain phase with your customer and they want to evaluate your product and they want to work towards a certain timeline, it's important that you help them hit their goals. And in order to hit their goals, a weekly call is the best way to stay on track. It really is. Otherwise, it is going to unravel. Something is going to happen. And so as the sales rep, it is your job to help your customer understand this and explain the why. So it's it's as simple as saying, hey, mister Champion. I am so excited to work with you on this project. What I've seen to help keep us on track is let's schedule a weekly call, just ten, fifteen minutes every week to see how we're progressing. I found that things can unravel, especially towards the end when we start going through legal and security. So let's have this as a placeholder. If we don't need it, of course, we can always cancel, but let's hold this and find time to chat every week. And I was doing this with one large financial institution, and we met every Wednesday. And this deal never seemed like it was going to close. But because we had this time every Wednesday, even if he had nothing to tell me on that call, I had the chance to ask uncomfortable questions, and no one wants to be uncomfortable. So then he moved the deal forward and would do things. And sometimes it got to a point that he he was the kindest, but he would do things and give me the email update to say, hey. I pushed this forward. We don't need to have the call today. So I think, you know, it really it really was a helpful tool. It's very hard to ask. It might seem uncomfortable, but it is a good test. And if someone does do this, it can keep your deal on track. It makes all the difference, especially as a quarter comes to a close. So let's say that we've been doing our weekly calls. We've had a series of discovery calls, demos. We've done the big team demo, but we still haven't explicitly engaged power. So, Marissa, you talked about it's critical that you, at least, have a clear response, written response from power, or you have directly spoken to power. So let's say we get to the point where the champion might be comfortable introducing you to the CMO or whoever it is in this case. Right? If you're at the tail end of a deal cycle, what's the right way to engage with power at the end? Yep. I think in a perfect world, you engage the EB at the beginning. That's the perfect world because there aren't any asks in the beginning. You're just saying, hey. I'm the executive on my side. It's a pleasure to meet you. Really appreciate you allowing your team to spend time evaluating our product. Because at the end of the day, this person's team is spending time evaluating your product, and they should know that, and you can express gratitude. So I think that's the ideal world. I think that's easier said than done because sometimes you don't know who the EV is in the beginning. So in those instances where it's at the end, we've tried a couple things at Figma. One is, ideally, your champion tells you who the EV is. If they do that, then you can have your executive on your side send an email saying, really appreciate your sponsorship. Thank you so much. Your team x y z person has been a pleasure to work with and give your champion a little bit of kudos. And if there's an ask, you'd say, we'd love to hop on a call, understand your vision for 2023. Like, I think those are all things you can say in that email if you have the person's name. We've also tried, if we don't get the person's name, we have burned ourselves in the past by emailing the wrong person. And so what I would say not to do is don't go blindly emailing the highest c level person because it could actually hurt you more than help you. So I would definitely recommend asking your champion. And if your champion doesn't give you a name but you're still trying to figure things out, use your network. Go on LinkedIn. See who's following your company. See who's a third party connection. We are literally doing this with a deal right now. We're trying to close an organization by the end of the year, and our VP of communications is connected to someone who's an executive on our customer's team. So we're gonna have her send a note to say, hey. We're would love your guidance. We're working towards a partnership this year. Any insight you have would be really helpful. So use the team around you when all else fails with with what your champion is telling you. So let's say you get access to that executive, and they don't just reply and say, okay. They say, sure. I'm open to meet with you, whether at the beginning or at the later part of the deal cycle. Let's assume we're not asking for a negotiation or a price concession or anything like that right now. We're still in the process of trying to get power involved or onboard. Right? You usually get thirty minutes at most with a c level executive, especially in the enterprise. How do you typically run that call? When I have done this call and we just did this for, a 6 figure deal that closed this quarter is the beginning is learning about them. And it's typically one to one, though if the rep wants to be there, that's okay. But I think the one to one is just more human and comfortable. So in this one, I introduced myself. I said, I've been here for over two and a half years. I work with largest the largest organizations, and we're thrilled for the opportunity to work with you as well. I say, I'd love to learn more about you and your what are what are your priorities going into 2023? And they just talk. And then you ask you do your own discovery, and you ask questions and say, wow. And it has nothing to do with Figma. It has everything to do with them, and you show genuine interest. And then from there, you can pivot probably, like, 12 in to awesome. So we are in the midst of this evaluation, and we're hoping to finalize by the end of this year. I'd be curious, like, what's your take on how things are going so far. And that's, like, a really nice pivot into your product itself. And then at the end, I in this particular call, this person was so visionary, and I said, I would love to have you come speak to our team. We have annual conferences. It would be so great to have you speak on stage. Like, there's just so much good work I think we could do together. And this person, I knew that he likes to speak. So it was it was a good moment in time to say we would love to do that. And what I was also doing in this particular call is planting roots for an upsell. We sell multiple products now at Figma. So I said, there's so much more we could do with FigJam. I would love the opportunity to explore that with you. And so the goal was to get together after Thanksgiving. And so that I think that call could just be so it's so important for both locking in your deal, establishing relationship, and hopefully upselling for the future if you have multiple products. So that call went well. What do you do when you ask the question? I'd love to hear how your take on how things are going, and they say, well, I don't really know what you do or where things are. What do you do when they, like, need reorientation around everything? What's your approach there? I have had that too. I think it is it is the for me, and it is a it is a style thing, but I think being human in that moment is the most important thing. In this in one particular instance, I was under the impression that this person knew they were gonna be spending $20,000, and that was not their impression. He said it, and I said and then he kinda kept going for, like, five minutes, and I took it back. And I said, I realized I think I caught you off guard with what I just said earlier. And I think it's just humanizing what you said, and he laughed. And I think as much as you can do that when they don't go well, whether it's they didn't understand pricing, they don't understand what your product does. If they don't understand what your product does, I think you can say, wow. We must have skipped a step. Let me help you understand what we do. And I my understanding is your team is looking to solve x, and we're gonna help you accomplish that outcome, which is why your team has been spending the last six months evaluating our product. It's slowing down and humanizing yourself, and it goes back to the call prep. And what I do with my team is they send a doc to me beforehand with the intended outcome of the call as well as all the conversations to date and what are the positive business outcomes we're gonna help them solve. And if I have those things, I can go into this call and handle those gotcha moments a bit better than if I don't have the prep. Well, Marissa, the reason you were able to have this conversation is because you're having it one to one, and you're not having it five on one. And a lot of people think you need to blob sell and bring the entire blob of people on your team to every single interaction. But the reason you are team selling is you're allowed to take parallel tracks in your deal. And by engaging with that executive one to one, we've had Ian Konjac on our podcast, top producer from Salesforce, a number of times, and he talks about this concept called yo yo selling. And the reason that it's important that you do this is if you bring the executive into the weeds of an entire team jumps on every single call with them, they get deal fatigue, and they kick you down to the team. Versus you can have your reps and your sales engineers handle all of the technical people, all of the champions, but then you can be the single thread that has the right to stay in touch with power, and you can call on that when people below the line might not be able to call on that thread. So alright. You've done all this wonderful stuff. You've gotten to the end of the deal. You've got terms out there, and now the customer wants a discount. You guys do something sort of unique. Can you tell me about it? We do something a little unique. We do not discount at Figma, and many a procurement team have gotten very upset with us at this point in the process. And one went to the extent to ask around and verify that, in fact, we do not discount. So we we are being honest when we say that. It's hard. I think one of the things we've learned is setting expectations as early as you can, at least with your champion and EB if you've met them. So by the time the procurement team comes around, it it isn't a surprise, or if it is, our champion has our back. We also do not waiver. So they we have been tested. Like, customers have pushed us to the very end of the quarter, and when we still do not waiver, then they believe us. But we we too get tested by our customers to see if we're being honest. So, Marissa, like, you you talked about how people will hold you to the end of the quarter. Some people probably purposely let a deal slip to test you because they think you might give a discount. And so how do you hold people accountable? And especially in enterprise deals, how do you make sure your deals don't slip when you cannot use commercials as a lever? Yes. It's tricky. One thing that's worked well for us is we give free access to our product in parallel with the legal process. And so we strongly believe you have the business track and you have the procurement track. And on the business track, they are in the proof of concept. They are in Figma. They are implementing their design system. The team is loving it. And we tell our champion, if we don't have a signature by x date, you are going to lose access. And for us, you never have that date be the end of the quarter. You always have that be, like, two or three weeks before the quarter ends. Otherwise, you are probably going to have your deal slip. And we know they typically do slip. So we say you are going to lose access if we don't have this finalized in time. They don't believe us. We tell the procurement team this is going to happen. Like, we have to have this done by this date. And when we don't hit that date, we do turn the access off. We give a lot of heads up notice. It is really compelling. Otherwise, we are locked up with our champion, and we say, hey. We will keep your access back on, but we need to see a return draft by this date in order to keep this on, and we need to schedule the next call with your legal team. So we try to do certain things depending on the scenario. We always overcommunicate, but having that proof of concept in place has been really helpful for us to keep things on track, without having a discount. Marissa, this has been a killer episode, and I love how you hold your customer accountable all throughout the the sales process. We are running out of time here, and we gotta move ourselves to the final question. And so the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of good things salespeople should be doing. Now let's talk about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what's one bad habit you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Yes. The bad habit I alluded to a bit before, but it is waiting until the end to introduce your EV versus starting with an EV connection at the very beginning of your deal, I think, is something we all could do a better job of doing. Beautiful. Marissa, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon.

And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Marissa Bell include, number one, a champion must have both influence and authority. Three ways you can suss that out are they agree to a weekly call, they bring in their boss, and they bring in cross functional teammates. Number two, in a big team demo, you should be constantly DM ing your internal team and getting them to ask the questions that you need to get answered. It means more when it comes from them. Number three, handle your executive calls one on one. Do not send five people into the meeting with their CMO. It's a great way to get deal fatigue for that CMO and get kicked below the line. And then lastly, number four, use POCs and trials to manufacture urgency. Get them using the trial. But the moment they ask for continued usage, use that as leverage to get legitimate commitment on the deal. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out? You can help us out by submitting yourself to this test right here. There's a three point checklist to see, are you a champion for thirty minutes to presidents club? One, are you willing to bring in your boss? Are you willing to tell your boss, hey. I have been up leveling my sales skills by listening to these guys interview world class sellers. That's test one. Test two, do you bring in functional teammates? Cross functional, maybe not cross functional, but are you telling your teammates about thirty minutes to presidents club? And then three are you subscribing to a weekly meeting aka listening to the show every single month? If you are a true champion you might do those things, or you might just join us next week on thirty minutes to Presidents Club. Thanks for listening.
