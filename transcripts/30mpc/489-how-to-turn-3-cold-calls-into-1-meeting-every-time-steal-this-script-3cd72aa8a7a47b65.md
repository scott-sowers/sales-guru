## Transcript

Today, I wanted to walk through the cold call script that I used when I was selling and continue to coach teams on that consistently can get top reps to book one in three cold call connects. That literally means if you talk to three people, you can get one person to agree to a meeting. So it is literally the best feeling in the world in sales to know that you can go into a one hour dial session and you can leave with a meeting on the books. And a lot of people are really, really struggling to generate pipeline, book meetings, cold emails basically broken nowadays because of all these AI spam bots, and you see a lot of teams that are going back to the phones. And the key here, folks, is the vast majority of the advice that I give you today is going to basically be doing the exact opposite of what most telemarketers do when they ask you how's your day going? Or when they hurl a pitch at you or when they try to, like, handle an objection. So there are three parts to nailing the cold call, and we'll walk through them one by one. Part number one is the opener where we'll use what I call the heard the name tossed around, cold call opener. Part number two is pitch, and that's where we use something called a problem proposition. And then part number three is when you handle objections. The way we're gonna do that is with what I call the mister Miyagi method to handling objections. And by the way, if you've read our cold calling book, it's called Cold Calling Sucks, and that's why it works. We break all this stuff down inside of that. Sold 50,000 copies in a year. It was the number one prospecting book last year. And so this is really pulling from a lot of stuff there, but you'll also hear some more voiceovers from me. And the last thing is I'll be using an example for a company that I consult for. Their name is Covey. And And the reason I'm using them is because it's really, really simple. What their product does is if you have, like, a million resumes that you need to screen, it's an AI bot that screens all of those resumes very quickly so that you don't have to review all 1,000,000 resumes. You can review the 100 best profiles that actually are qualified to work for your company. Alrighty. So let's turn that into cold call terms. So step number one is let's talk about the opener. There are two banned cold call openers that you should never use. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. In your life. And they're the two most common ones that you'll see. The first the link in the show notes. In your life. And they're the two most common ones that you'll see. The first one is how's your day going. So whenever you pick up the phone and you ask a prospect how's your day going, you know that you don't give a shit how their day is going, and they know you don't give a shit how their day is going. And so nine times out of 10, what you will hear is something that sounds like, fine. How can I help you? And that exasperated sigh is code word for, hey. I know you're a telemarketer. Just get on with it, and I'm just waiting to reject you. A lot of times you'll just get rejected after that. That's number one. Other one that's even worse is did I catch you at a bad time? It is never a good time for a cold call. And nine times out of 10, if you ask someone, a complete stranger, did I catch you at a bad time? They're gonna be like, yeah. It is a bad time. And then you might ask, when can I call you back? And they're like, not now. Call me call me tomorrow. And then they're part of the witness protection program, and you will literally never connect with that prospect again. And so what we're gonna do instead is we're literally going to do the exact opposite of what most telemarketers do. Is my goal when I'm opening cold call is for them to actually forget that it's a cold call. I want them to actually think that I'm, like, in their warm network, almost like I got referred to talk to them. And so that's what we call the heard the name tossed around opener. K? There are three steps to nailing the heard the name tossed around opener. Number one is you wanna have some context. In other words, you wanna find, like, the common thread between that customer and other customers like them. So for example, like, in this case, when I was selling insurance, I used to say, like, hey, Jane. We work with a few other, partners in the DLA Piper office down in LA. It's it's Arman from Northwestern. Have you heard her name tossed around? And that was like, I worked with other people in the same office. Like, the closer you can get to home, the better. Part of the reason they won't totally blow you off is, like, even if you work with other people in the office and they're like, I don't know this person, and I think they might be trying to sell something, they're probably not gonna be a complete jerk to you because you work with other people in their office or you work with people who share the same investor. If you're like, hey, Jane. I work with other people who breathe. It's like it's it's not really close to home. They're gonna be like, oh, it's like fake personalization. So you gotta, like, find that common thread. If you're stuck, sometimes you can combine threads. So you might say like, hey. I I work with a few other CFOs in, like, the Chicago area. It's it's Arman from Acmeco. Have you heard your name tossed around? Even if they haven't heard your name tossed around, it doesn't matter. Like, I use this at startups where I was the ninth employee and, like, no one knew who I was. I use this when I was 19 years old selling insurance and don't definitely no one knew who I was. It's about acting like you should have. So the vast majority of time, people will say, like, no. Like, I haven't, but, like, how can I help you? And you'll notice, like, their demeanor is a lot more positive than the fine. How can I help you? That you'll get, like, with the how's your day going thing. And it's because you led with context. So if they say no, that brings us to the pitch. But before we go to the pitch, there's a chance that they say yes. They're like, oh, yeah. I've heard of you guys before. And here's a secret. If they've heard of you before, you don't have to pitch. You would be like, oh, I guess we must have screwed something up. Normally, we'd be working with someone like you by now. I guess, what did you hear? And then they'll usually just, like, bring you right to the objection or they'll be like, oh, I've I've been considering you guys for a while or, oh, I'm I'm not super familiar, but I've definitely, like, heard the name tossed around. And you sort of, like, go to the pitch anyways. Alright? So that brings us to step two, which is pitch, which is not actually a pitch. So the problem with most pitches is they tend to be like, we focus. They tend to focus on, like, what you do instead of, like, what prospect is thinking about. So, like, let's say for example, you were looking at, like, nutrition plans or workout plans or something in the fitness space. No one cares about your seven day shortcut to shred weightlifting program. They care about, hey. I wanna, like, look really good during the summer without spending all day in the gym. That's what gets their attention. And so you wanna lead with the problem they're trying to solve and then just solve the problem in as few sentences as possible. Like, this is where, like, marketing teams totally screw over salespeople. It's like they just stuff them with product knowledge, and they're like, this feature produces this benefit, and this feature produces this benefit. It's like we have this dashboard that gives you visibility across all your managers, and, like, you end up speaking in product language instead of problem language. And so the problem proposition is very simple. You're gonna lead with a triggering problem that literally gets your prospect to, like, sit up, and they're like, okay. That's pretty good. And then you want to solve it in one sentence with a one sentence solution, and then you just want ask if they're open to learning more in, like, a low friction or an interest based called action. So that sounds like this. If we go back to that example at Covey again, it's an AI screening resume bot. You wanna, like, describe this problem in, like, triggering specificity. That might sound like this. Normally, when I'm talking to, like, other talent leaders in the Sequoia portfolio, they, like, are completely inundated with, like, 3,000 applications on the first day that they post a software engineer job posting. Covey uses AI and and takes in, like, everything that you give us around your ideal candidate profile, and it will surface the top 10% of candidates so you don't have to screen all of the resumes. My guess is, like, you're probably totally set. But are you open to, like, taking a look at this thing for when it rolls not now, but, like, when I'm not cold calling you out of the blue? And so, again, the three steps there is, like Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Triggering problem. That triggering problem needs to have hairy lollipop specificity. What I mean by that is if I told you a story where, like, you're walking around, you're like licking a lollipop, and then you dropped it onto a shag rug, and you held it up to this light right here. What would you see? You would see, like, hair and, like, dust speckles, like, off of the lollipop and it would be disgusting. Like, that's the level of specificity that you need when you're describing your problem. If the level of specificity that you're using when you're describing the problem is, like, people don't like screening resumes or, like, doing this task takes a lot of time, it's not triggering enough. It doesn't evoke an emotion. So, like and a lot of this comes forward in your tone where it's like it's, like, absolutely ridiculous. They have to screen literally. Like, imagine screening, like, a thousand paper resumes. Like, the stack would go this high on top of your desk. Like, it is actually laughable to think about it, so some of this comes through in your tone. And then with your one sentence solution, you don't give too many details about your product. People don't care what your product does. People need to know enough about what your product does so that they can believe you can solve the problem. So notice in that case, I wasn't like, oh, and we can filter by this, this, this, this, and this, and we have this type of UI and these dashboards and reporting and all this nonsense that, like, no one understands. I was saying, like, hey. Like, we use AI to take what you wanna see in a good candidate, and then we only show you the best candidates which solves that problem. It's dumb human language. No buzzwords like single source of truth, streamline, optimize, all in one platform, leading provider of one stop shop. All of these things mean absolutely nothing to your prospect. They sound good to your marketing team, but they nothing to a prospect. And they're also all the words that, like, every other seller is using, and so they immediately put you, like, back in the telemarketer category. And then lastly, don't ask them for a meeting. In your call to action, meetings feel heavy. Try to ask them for, like, interest if they're open to learning more. Or in the best case, ask them to, like, take a test drive or come up with an offer where it's like, hey. Do you wanna give this thing a spin on one of your roles? Not now, but when I'm not calling you out of the blue. Right? See if you can, like, get them to take a seat in the car, not, like, sit down for a thirty minute demo with a specialist, which, like, no one wants to do right now. And now at some point, like, every once in a while, you get a nice deal where they're like, sure. That sounds great. I'd love to be. And whenever that happens, I'm almost, like, surprised. So, like, look up the person's LinkedIn. I'm like, do they still work here? Like, did I even call the right person? But, like, sometimes people will say yes. Usually, people will be like, some sort of objection. Alright? And so this is when we start to talk about the mister Miyagi approach to handling objections. What most people do when they are handling objections is they try to handle the objection. They try to fight the objection. And if you've ever had someone try to change your mind, the number one thing that I can do to not change your mind is I can tell you that you're wrong. K? And that's what most sellers do when they hear an objection. If someone says, like, I'm not interested, they start, like, pitching harder and they're like, well, like, here's why I believe the solution that we bring is more valuable than what you're using today. Or if someone is, like, citing a competitor, you'll say, like, oh, well, that competitor is not good for reasons like this, this, and this, and other customers saw the value because of this, this, and this. And the customer starts kicking away because, like, usually when someone gives an objection, it's because they've made a decision to do things a certain way, and that way was not your way. And so when you fight that objection, you're fighting the way that they do things. Okay? And so that's why the first step of handling any objection is to pattern break, and you're actually going to agree with the objection. So let's pretend that someone gives us a competitor as an objection. Okay? And so for the sake of Covey, let's assume that they're using some other resume screening bot, right, of which there are many. So I'm gonna say something like this. I should have assumed you had something in place because, honestly, like, screening thousand resumes would be a huge pain. And I'm not gonna lie, like, usually when you have a bot in place, like, it doesn't even make sense to switch off of it. So they're like, is this person not gonna sell me? That's what happens when you agree with the objection is, like, you release pressure. Step number two is you need to incentivize conversation. I don't have enough information to handle this objection yet, and I need to start to get them talking. When people start talking, they tend to feel comfortable. The job of a good therapist is to get their person talking. If the therapist is doing all the talking, then the person will start to clam and be like, don't give me advice. Don't solve my problem for me. Like, part of the reason therapy works is, like, they get you to talk yourself into the right solution. Right? And so we're gonna do some, like, sales therapy here, and we're gonna do something really slick. So here's the secret with competitors. I need to ask them a trap question, and I need to know, like, at least one trap question per competitor. What that means is I need to think of what is one thing that my competition can't do that I can do. And then I'm just gonna ask them how they do that thing so that they come to the answer on their own terms. So in the case of Covey, a lot of times someone's existing recruiting software will have, like, an AI bot attached to it, but it's, like, pretty crappy. It's, like, glorified filters. Right? And there are certain things that you can't look for. Like, you can't look for, like, someone who got multiple promotions in a short period of time, like trajectory or worked for, like, certain blue chip type of companies. And so I'm just gonna, like, ask that in a trap question. So I'm gonna say like, hey, Jane. Just so no one from my team calls you again, I noticed that your team is, like, hiring a bunch of, like, software engineers. And I have to assume that in the bot, you're able to do things like point out the human level nuance of things like quick promotions over a certain number of years or worked for, like, blue chip tech companies in this industry or, like, worked for both big companies and small companies so they've seen scale in startups? Like, are you able to, like, get that level of nuance just because I I wanna make sure that this is, like, actually a dead deal? So notice I'm doing a lot of incentivizing here. And what I mean by that is I'm constantly throwing in little things like, hey. Just so my team doesn't call you again or just so I, like, actually make sure that this one's, like, a complete waste of time. Could you, like, really tell me, like, why this thing doesn't work? But then I'm, like, layering in little traps, and I'm like, hey. Like, my my guess is you can probably see if someone's gotten four promotions in the last seven years, and, like, that's something that I know the other competition can't do. I'm, like, laying these traps so that they'll usually give you an answer that's like, it doesn't do all of that, but it it sort of gets the job done for the most part. And that's my opportunity to do step three, which is, like, selling the test drive. Okay. So here's the thing is like, you're like right at the finish line. You've you've sort of like poke this hole of doubt in the competitor. And a lot of times this is when like sellers will come in with like pressure pitch and they'll be like, well, our product like has the ability to, like, do all these advanced filters and show you these types of candidates and these types of candidates and immediately the prospects, like, sales pitch again and, like, you lose the deal. Right? And so you never wanna sell the product. You wanna sell the test drive. Okay? So you don't want to like sell people here. Here's this like nice shirt that I want you to buy right now. Here's this like Tesla. I want you to buy right now. You want to be like, hey, like, I know you got a car already. Like, do you want to give this thing a ride? Like, just just so you know it's out there. And nine times out of 10, like, people wanna take the test drive. Like, Tesla has sold a ton of cars to people who, like, never thought they were gonna get a Tesla. And then they took the test drive and they're like, oh, like, that's that's a car. Right? And so you're gonna do that with your product. And so if I was selling the test drive at Covey with Jane, I'm gonna say something like this. I'm gonna like, Jane, honestly, like, I've noticed, like, you're hiring some, like, really awesome engineers, and, like, my guess is you have a pretty refined candidate profile. My guess is you're probably not gonna switch off of your existing tool. But, like, are you open to, like, us running this on one of your roles because we can filter for a lot of that, like, human level nuance that you're talking about? And if nothing else, like, you'll know what's out there and you can see what it looks like. And nine times out of 10, they'll be like, yeah. I'll I'll take a look. And then, like, once they're in the car, then you can be like, so, like, maybe we could talk about financing. Maybe we could buy out your current car. Maybe we can, like, buy out your lease. Like, you can do all that stuff and, quote, unquote, sell the value of your solution when you aren't doing a cold call on a complete stranger. But, like, a common mistake that people will make is, like, they'll try to, like, turn these cold calls into sales pitches. And, like, the phone is a meeting setting device. Like, get them on an actual call where you can, like, sit down. You're not catching them in between meetings. You're not gonna get, like, interrupted by them, like, being, like, shoot. I gotta jump to my next one. And then you can actually walk them through a proper sales process. If you like this one, there are a couple resources that I'll give you free. One, like, we have this entire script template for yourself that you can get in the show notes. We have 18 objection talk tracks. I literally went through one of them that you can access for free down in the show notes. And if you really like this one, we put together an entire quote calling course that walks through the opener, the problem prop, the objections, how to manage your day, and a million other different things that I didn't cover in this video inside of a step by step course. And because you're watching this video, there's a special discount code down in the YouTube show notes so you can go check those ones out. Alrighty, folks. If you like this one, it would mean a ton if you liked and subbed. This channel is the number one way that we can continue to keep doing content like this. And if you like this one, let me know what you wanna see down below in the comments or something like that. We cover all types of cold calling things, and I've talked about cold calling so much that I don't always know what is top of mind for people out there. So let me know what you wanna cover or if you have, like, a product that we would wanna do, like, a pitch on or something like that, and, I'm sure we'll come up with something fun. Alrighty, folks. Peace.
