## Transcript

What's going on, folks? It is Arman, and I have a an announcement that I'm super stoked about today. So as you all know, around once per quarter, we launch a new sales course. Now courses in this world and in general, like, kinda have this, like, grifty reputation to them. I'm not gonna lie. And the reason for that is, like, there are a lot of folks who will just, like, shell out a PDF for five payments of $69.95 and call it their sales course, or they won't even, like, properly prep an outline and just, like, show up and record something at home and, like, charge people $300 for it. And our bar for our free content is, like, disgustingly high already. Like, creators will get off of the recording with us, and they're like, holy shit. I have never seen a crew that is so inortentive about the way that you do content. And if you think our bar is high for the stuff that you hear every single week, it is a million times higher for our courses. And so over the last twelve to sixteen weeks, every single week, we've been sitting down with the well known only Jen Allen Knuth for two to three hours per week plus an entire week of shooting to plan her course selling to the c suite, and that is dropping officially available for preorder as of today. It is literally everything you could possibly need to close a 6 to 7 figure deal at Power. So if you're an SMB seller looking to level up to mid market or upper mid market or, like, really, if you're trying to crack into enterprise, there are few people who are as good in the game as Jen Allen is around multithreading, getting the power, booking meetings with executives, securing budget, sizing the cost in action, everything you need to close a complex deal, AKA not a transactional two k one call close, this is the course for you. So it will literally go through everything from the exact email templates you need to prospect into an executive, how do you book a meeting and actually get an executive's attention, which is not the same way that you approach a below the line prospect. And then it goes through step by step how to run an executive discovery call or how to run a champion discovery call that gets you introduced to an executive. And the final piece is how do you multithread and access the suite of power and run a big team meeting to get everyone on board together. So it is literally everything you could need. And if you're not familiar with Jen Allen, she used to be a cohost of this show. We do a ton of content with her. She sold over $10,000,000 in deals with Challenger. She now trains some of the best sales organizations out there from massive organizations like IBM to Juniper Networks and more. She is hilarious. During the course of the the course of the shoot, she dropped more f bombs than I've ever seen anyone drop, and we were cracking up the entire time. But it was this perfect balance of a course that was hilarious and fun to watch, but at the same time, I literally used some of the stuff alongside Nick to close one of our first big enterprise deals when we were selling my courses to sales teams. We used the stuff from her course the next week after we shot it because it was that good. So, folks, if you like what you hear, you can go check out the course at the link below. Know that right now, it's in preorder period. So, if you order before February 13, k, you there's, like, pretty pretty steep discount on it. It's, like, a 33% discount or something like that. During launch week on February 20, it's a little bit higher. And then once it goes live, it goes to full price. So when we give out discounts, we try to, like, let people know in advance, like, we are paying you, in the words of Todd Capone, we are paying you for our ability to predict. So the cheapest price that you will literally ever get this thing at is right now during the preorder period. So go check it out. Go support Jen. You'll see some, like, previews down below from the course. And, you know what? I think let's actually drop Jen's trailer in right here. So if you like what you hear from this, here is the actual trailer from Jen's course, folks, and I hope I get to see you inside. Alright. Peace y'all. We analyzed over a million executive sales cycles with Gong and found that if we wanna sell bigger deals, we've gotta do three things. Number one, we have got to get to power. You are nearly 50% more likely to close a mid market or enterprise deal when an executive is involved. Number two, we have got to include more stakeholders. The average 6 figure deal includes over 10 stakeholders. And number three, we have got to defeat status quo. Status quo is responsible for 51 of closed lost deals. Now imagine you're taking 10 friends to dinner. If you've ever done this before, you know it's an absolute nightmare. One friend's a vegan. One friend didn't like the service at this restaurant. One wants to go to a new place. More often than not, what we end up doing is just defaulting to a restaurant we've been before where everybody was okay with what happened. And executive buying cycles are no different. We might have a better solution, a better way to solve the problem, but better is no competition when an executive has decided that good is good enough. So we need to stop pitching products and solutions and outbound, jumping to solution and discovery, and asking our champions to pitch the solution to the broader buying group. Instead, we need to get both the executive and the buying group to agree that this is a problem worth solving and worth solving now before we jump into solution. I'm Jen Allen Knuth aka Demand Gen with a j, and I've sold over $50,000,000 in enterprise revenue. And now I'm teaching teams how to do the exact same in across every industry from companies like IBM, g two, and Square. But I didn't always do a great job of selling enterprise deals. In fact, when I first started selling enterprise, I remember walking into my manager's office for a one on one and thinking of every excuse in the book why it wasn't my fault for me missing my quota. So marketing wasn't giving me enough leads. The product didn't have specific capabilities that I deemed that we needed. The price was too high. So on and so forth. And I remember my manager at the time, Kevin, looked me in the face and said, Jen, you're not wrong. You probably should be getting more leads. We probably should have that product capability. But at the end of the year, it's your number. You own the make and you own the miss. So you have two options. We can spend this one on one with you complaining and finger pointing at everybody else, or we can use this time to figure out what you can do within your control to change that outcome. Obviously, I was a little bit more interested in option one, but option two was the right answer. And so that set me on a path to figure out how could I stop messing up my sales experience and instead turn it into a competitive advantage. And that's exactly what we're gonna do in the course today. Now there are three parts to how I sell an enterprise deal to the c suite. Number one is executive level prospecting. So you're gonna get everything you need to book a high quality meeting with a c suite executive. And I'm gonna teach you how to do that in a way that cuts through all of the noise we're seeing in these channels and gives them a compelling reason to reconsider how they're solving the problem today. Number two is executive discovery. You're gonna learn how to help an executive realize the need to change. Now I'm gonna teach you how to get in a discovery conversation to sound less like an interrogation and more like a two way conversation about their business. And number three is multithreading. You're gonna learn everything you need to get the buying group to a collective yes. I'm gonna teach you how to identify a champion, how to multithread, how to run a large buying group meeting, and how to present the solution to the executive. So let's say you've had a discovery call of the champion. There's a point in the sales cycle where you're going to need to assemble the buying group. So let's see a preview of the seven steps to get to buying group consensus. So step number one is aligning with our champion on the cost of an action. Now our goal here is to create urgency for solving the problem. So instead of leading with the solution and hope they care about the problem, we're going to clearly illuminate the negative consequences of how they're solving the problem today. Step number two is ghostwriting the meeting ask. So our goal here is just to get the meeting booked with the broader buying group. So instead of dumping that ask on your champion's plate, we're gonna learn how to ghostwrite the meeting with ask so that we can remove some effort from our champions plate. Step number three is seeking out deal friction before the big group meeting. So our goal here is simply to preempt objections before they occur in the meeting itself. So instead of waiting for the meeting to happen and then combating them as they come, we're gonna work with our champion before that big group meeting to anticipate what some of those objections might be. So step number four is preparing our champion for that big group meeting. So our goal here is to make this feel like a combined effort between the champion and ourselves. Now instead of blindsiding that champion in the big group meeting with an uncomfortable question, we're gonna work with them in advance of the meeting to identify questions that they can ask so it's not just me running the session, but we're co facilitating together. Step number five is how we open that big group meeting. Now most executives are pretty skeptical of salespeople, so our goal here is to lower their defenses within the first few minutes of that meeting. And the way that we're gonna do that is by not teeing this up as a solution demo, but rather as a problem discussion. So step number six is running that big group meeting. Now our goal here is to get the buying group to decide if this is a problem worth solving and worth solving now. So instead of doing a large group demo, we're gonna facilitate a problem discussion to arrive at whether or not there's consensus that this is a problem worth solving. And lastly, step number seven is how we close the meeting. So our goal here is simply to get clear answers around whether this is a problem we're solving and we're solving now. So instead of allowing the group to debrief on their own, we're gonna learn some questions that allow us to understand is this a yes, a no, or a maybe. So that was an example of what you'll learn in the course. Now before we dig in, you probably have some questions around whether or not this course is right for you. So one question might be, we already have a sales methodology. Coming from the sales methodology world, having spent decades selling for them, I can tell you that most sales methodologies are built on the same premise, which is to identify a need, recommend a solution, and get to the yes. So whether or not you're using MEDDPIC, you're using Challenger, or you're using even a homegrown sales methodology, this course is going to address the fundamentals that allow you to work through those steps. So the second question you might be asking is, well, is this gonna work for my industry or my deal size? So if you are selling to small business, the answer is no. Don't waste your money. This course is specifically designed to those that are selling in mid market or enterprise that are selling bigger deals. Now if you're in a small business role and your goal is to get to mid market enterprise, this course is gonna help you prepare to take on a role like that. The third question you might have is, how do I know if this is gonna work for my product? This was something really important when we built out the course. You will not just hear a bunch of sales examples from me. We're picking examples from hardware, software, selling into public companies, private companies, k through 12 so that we can account for all different types of scenarios in which you might be selling. And the last question you might be asking is, is this course more for beginners or folks with more experience? So the ideal participant for this course is going to be someone who has a little bit of closing experience, but you might be trying to sell bigger deals or try to get better access to power. And if you're still not convinced, here are some testimonials from demand gen clients that I've actually taught. So if you're ready to dive in, you'll get everything you need to run an executive deal cycle. Everything from prospecting to discovery to multithreading to presenting the solution. Let's dive in. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes.
