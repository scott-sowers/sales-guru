## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Mark Casaglow. And today, we have the one and only mister Paul Canty. He used to run sales development over at Lattice, then he was a senior sales manager, and now he's head of sales at a company called Poli. Mark, why should people listen? Arman, I think Paul has tapped into something that a lot of young sales managers and people that have kinda lost their way in sales management, maybe lost their passion, have started to manage their team, which is via Slack, via email, and via Gong comments. And I think that he really gets into this episode of how to be a person in front of a person, helping a person do better. Boom. And a three, two, one. Let's roll. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alrighty, Paul. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Number one, ask for a weekly goal, but ask for a how behind the goal. Don't get me wrong. Goals are great, but what is the behavior, the process, the system that's gonna actually drive that outcome? For example, I I had an SCR who who wanted to book five meetings in a week. That's a great goal, but how are they gonna get there? Right? And his plan was he's gonna make an extra 10 calls per day. He's gonna spend extra time going through Zoom info, finding direct dials and cell phones for these people to make sure he gets through. And so set goals, yes, but figure out how you're gonna get to those goals as well. Boom. My goal is to hear tactic number two. Bring it on. Tactic number two. Make shadowing and ride alongs a weekly nonnegotiable. For busy managers, directors, sales leaders, this is the first thing to slip, particularly as you move up the ladder. But there's no better way to understand workflow inefficiencies or gaps or coaching focus areas than getting in and spending time with your reps. Awesome. Bring it home. What's number three? Number three, share what you're working on up and down on a regular cadence. When people don't know what you're working on, whether it's your team or your execs, the founders that you report to, they start to wonder if you're working on anything at all. And so sharing up and down can help make sure you're on the same page with your bosses, with your founders, with the executive team, while sharing down helps give the reps and the managers context into the things that you're doing behind the scenes to help them. The way that I like to do this is send in a weekly email. Doesn't have to be structured. You don't have to make an ask, but letting your executives, letting your reps know, like, here are the things I've been working on this week. Here's what's on my mind. Here are the things I'm looking to get better at. Here's what I'm looking ahead to. Paul, as a first time manager, my company required me to do ride alongs every quarter with my reps. They were, like, super awesome times where I get to ride the car, see how they sold, see how they ate, where they ate, what they ate, all that kind of stuff. And, you know, in a Zoom world, I don't know if it's the same. Like, how do you do a a a shadowing on Zoom? I think the key for me is, like, you shouldn't be hanging out with somebody on a Zoom screen share all day, but you should really be trying to drill in to a specific part of the process at a time. Right? Like, for example, recently, it was really trying to understand, hey. Walk me through each step of your process when it comes to looking through a con looking through an account, finding the right contacts, enriching the contacts, and adding them to a sequence. Right? Like, that might be an hour worth of shadowing. That's enough for now for us to learn and diagnose. Take a bite sized chunk, and you're just like, alright. I wanna watch you put 30 people in sequence. That feels like micromanaging. How are you helping the rep to feel like they can, like, approach that situation and it's gonna be good for them too? Ideally, you share a reason that you're looking into it. Like, for this one, it might be, hey. Like, it looks like we're struggling to get people on the phone, right, or we're struggling to get reply rates, or our bounce rate is really high. Like, my hypothesis is maybe something's going on with the data, right, or something's going on with our our CRM, our data source. Why don't we sit down, spend some time going through the workflow together, and see if we can spot any issues or gaps? And I think a lot of the time, like, the reps know there there's an issue. Right? Or you can, at the very least, share with them some data and some context that will demonstrate that there's an issue. And I think framing it through that lens makes it feel like less of a, hey. Like, show me everything you're doing and more like, hey. Let's triage this together and find a solution. Some of the things you will see in these working sessions are truly mind boggling. The bizarre tab setups, the using the wrong tool, the not knowing where to look at all of your accounts. It's crazy if you haven't literally just sat there and watched someone else do the work, how many mistakes you'll make in workflow. Paul, could you talk about, number one, like, what are the key workflows that you're shadowing? And then two, as you go through those, maybe you could give us a sense of some of the common mistakes that are made within those workflows. A lot of mistakes are made around these certain breakpoints. Right? And a lot of times, that means, like, the transfer of information of data from one system to the other. For example, pulling information from your data provider into your CRM, right, or from sales app into your CRM or inputting, opportunity notes back into the CRM after a call. Like, I think a lot of the time, that's where there's friction and where there can be either, like, problems in terms of the data getting pulled in or pulled out as well as, you know, inefficiencies. Right? Like, people taking notes separately in, like, their Apple notes thing and then copying and pasting it into a Salesforce field and then pulling that to like, it can get really wonky, but I think that starting by trying to identify as in identify inefficiencies in those areas is is usually where you'll find them. How do you think about workflows, Paul? Is it like a like a checklist like a surgeon would have? Like, first, you know, put an x on the need and know that we're gonna work on the right knee. Secondly, get your, you know, get your hands washed. Third, like, get your scalpels ready. Fourth, like, make your incision. Like, do you believe in that level of detail, or are you just watching in general, like, how they're doing and approaching stuff? I'm generally watching to see, like, what's the goal of this workflow? Like, what does a successful execution of this step of the process look like? And I'm trying to see, like, if there are steps within that process that aren't getting us closer, right, or essentially adding unnecessary work without getting us closer to the end goal. So, like, hey. The goal here is to just get a fully enriched contact into the CRM. Are we taking steps that are unnecessary or that are additive work without being additive value? Could we start with the first part of the workflow? So oftentimes, the first part of the workflow is I need to find a list of five accounts that I can reach out to. Talk to me about some of the common mistakes you'll see SDRs or AEs make when they're reaching out to or pulling list of five accounts. They don't know why they're reaching out. That's the biggest problem I see is folks are reaching out and ask them why they're working a certain account, and they don't have a good answer. And I think that, you know, that can start from a place of not deeply understanding your ICP or who you really sell to, but it can also mean that, like, you don't have a full grasp on, like, what challenges your ICP or your buyer has that you're solving for them. Right? And so you're approaching this account with, I'm gonna work with them without having any sort of hypothesis as to what challenges you help solve for them, how you can make your life easier. And so that's the biggest one, and it's an exercise I did with some members of my team a couple weeks ago, which is like, hey. Just I wanna be able to pick an account from your book and have you explain to me why you're working them and and what problem you you think you feel strongly that we can probably solve for them. And if we don't know that, then it's really gonna be hard to message or call them effectively. You know, the other day, I had a post that was the highest activity rep is usually the lowest performing. And the reason that is almost always true is because the first five accounts you pull, you're usually gonna throw four of them in the garbage. And if you have an underperforming SDR and AE, you should almost always start by looking under the hood and seeing who's in sequence right now. And it's almost always the wrong accounts or the wrong contacts. Even an underperforming SDR will crank the phones all day. They'll usually try pretty hard if you hired right, but oftentimes, they'll be calling these companies in the middle of nowhere where you can only support US based companies. So I have a sense of okay. Step number one is, like, I need to make sure that they have ICP criteria on pulling the accounts. Paul, let's go to the next piece, which is I now need to pull the people on the accounts. What do you usually see go wrong in that part of the workflow? I think this is the second part of of the same problem, right, which is understanding your ideal customer profile from an account sense, but then understanding it from a buyer sense. Meaning, like, who are the people that we sell to? What are the challenges that they have that our product, our company can help them solve specifically? And to your point, I think a lot of what I see is, yes. This is a target account, so I'm just gonna kinda select five people that I think, you know, maybe have the right titles. Right? And I'm not gonna do a ton of research on LinkedIn as to their role, responsibility, seniority, and I'm not gonna really think too critically about, like, is this actually the person who'd be using the product, who would be paying for the product, or would be involved in the selection of something like this? And so, again, it's like, yeah, you have this list full of accounts and this sequence full of people, and you're kind of targeting everybody and you're targeting nobody. You know? If we keep running this train here, a lot of times to your point, they'll miss the wrong people, for example, or they'll only be calling people at the line, but no one above the line. You and I both sold HR tech. I was at Pave. You were at Lattice. We were selling to similar types of buyers. Could you give me a sense at Lattice? How did you go about teaching people? How sort of map their way inside of an org. In other words, like, I'm an SDR with almost no work experience, and somehow I need to know if there are 20 HR people which five I should work. How did you teach your team to think through that? Part of what was helpful for me in teaching that sort of thing was giving people a better understanding of of sort of the role of different seniority levels within a business and the sort of scope of their worldview. Meaning, like, what are the sort of business level objectives that the executive c level cares about, and what are the sort of, like, smaller objectives objectives that the HR manager, HR director cares about? An example actually that I used to give with folks, and this is from years ago, was when we were evaluating ZoomInfo, to bring it to Lattice. And it was a huge priority for me. Right? I was leading the SDR team. I really cared a lot about accurate data and cell phone numbers and equipping the team to be able to reach people. Like, it was high on my priority list. But if you were to ask Dini, our CRO at the time, it probably wasn't even on her radar. Right? Like, it was not even something she was thinking about. And so I think it was a helpful illustrative example for folks to just understand that even in organizations that aren't relatively big, the scope and the things people are thinking about and the context in which they're thinking about them can be very different. And so, like, the messaging and the way you target folks might look very different. The value propositions might be very different. The messaging might sound different even if it's a 500 person organization and then they're only a couple levels removed. Yeah. One exercise that I found really, really helpful to that point is you can't just throw the org tree up and a bunch of titles and say you wanna reach out to the chief people officer, the director of HR operations, the director of recruiting, the director of compensation, etcetera. And the reason for that is that big companies, there might be 50 directors of compensation or 50 directors of HR. At small companies, you might have one people hire where all of those roles are lumped into one person. And so what I found to be helpful is you map out the org chart. You say these are usual titles that are there. But then we play this game called follow the job, which is at Carta, the job was to manage the cap table. And I would put up an org chart, and I would remove two titles. And I would be like, okay. If those two titles don't exist in the org chart, where does managing the cap table fall from a responsibility standpoint? And what that teaches your reps and it teaches your SDRs is them to not just think, oh, if I don't see this titles, no one's doing the job, but instead start to understand the domains of responsibility. And as organizations get bigger and more complex, how do those responsibilities get thrown lower and lower down the chain of command? And that will tell you which levels of the org you should be prospecting. Yeah. I always use two documents, Armand, to help with this. One was a persona map, and that persona map would say, here is the job that we support and what it does, and here are examples of titles that might do that job. And you might have the same title in multiple columns of that because it's it's some people call a director a manager. Some people call a manager a VP. Like, you never really know. Right? But what we try to do is isolate what is the job they're doing and then what titles might do that. And the other one is a content map where we then take those personas on the x axis. And on the y axis, we would put, like, above the line people and below the line people. And then that would show us what content we needed to build for that persona above the line or below the line, and that also then created us a connect the dot situation. Okay. So if I know I need to do this job and the title and persona is this at this company, this is the content that I'm gonna be putting them into, and it just made it very simple for our SDRs at Outreach in the beginning to not think. Like, you want you want don't want a 21 year old thinking a lot. You want them doing a lot, and you want them learning as they're doing. And what what you're doing is is you're teaching them how to think through the problem. Figure out what the job is, figure out what the version of the title is of that company, then figure out what messaging to put them in, and I'll go execute that messaging. And that's a repeatable process that you can give people latitude with later once they've proven that you've done it. But in the beginning, you wanna keep it really tight. I love that framework because I think you're right. There are certain jobs and responsibilities that have to get done regardless of what the range of titles is within an organization. And so how can you best understand and map where they're most likely to fall to? Paul, I'm curious for you. As you've taught your team to look at the different roles, the different responsibilities, domains of expertise, whether it's at Lattice or at your current company, your SDRs now or your AEs now need to do initial outreach. Right? And to Mark's point, I've seen people try to teach SDRs how to tailor messages differently for the 30 different titles in the organization. Right? Talk to me about how do you make this easy for your team. In other words, how do you teach your team initially to personalize in a way that hits the mark but isn't overly complicated? I try to keep sequences simple, and give people simple frameworks. I think for above the line personas, generally, what I'm coaching towards is speaking to something that impacts the business, right, that impacts the business revenue, impacts retention, impacts cost or risk, but things that executive level folks are thinking about and concerned with. When talking about, like, let's say, below the line or lower or mid level folks, a lot of times they're thinking more immediate impact and things that might affect them personally. Right? The projects they have to get done, the initiatives they're responsible for, the things that they need to report back up to their VP, they might not always be thinking in terms of, like, broader business outcome and results, but more sort of immediate impact to them and their role and their reputation. And so I think the messaging should reflect that. Right? Which is that if you're going to the executive level, you should be talking in terms of the broader business. And if you're going to the mid or or junior level folks, you should be talking about how we can help them specifically succeed in their role or with their project. I still remember, I'm on, when, at Outreach, we had a volume play in the beginning because nobody was doing what we were doing. Nobody had a tool like we had, and and volume was very productive. And then it started to tail off when we saw it. And everybody has, like, the two curly braces with company name or two curly braces first name. And at Outreach, what we created was two curly braces with a exclamation point and a comment. And what it does is it allows you to put into the template the specific type of personalization that you want along with instructions of how to do it. And then you can even get it complicated and do if then statements inside of that personalization to help a rep figure out how to do the personalization. I would say when you're teaching a rep to do personalization, there's the conceptually how it works, but then there's the specific mechanics in that individual email that you're about to write. And, like, having that that variable, just that comment variable with the instructions of go here, look at this, use your your business acumen, and put something in here that's one sentence that does this. We found that to be super beneficial for a lot of companies that we work with and for our own company to have that specific variable in use inside of templates. Yeah. The the first level to that point that I usually see of personalization is no personalization, which is just use the persona based sequences or use above the line this sequence for this CFO. Right? And that's like giving your kid an action figure where you cannot remove the parts whatsoever. Like, this is the toy. Like, go play with the toy. That's it. The next one is like giving your kid sort of like a mister potato head, which is you can use trigger templates. If you run into these six triggers, pop out the first six sentences for one of these other six sentences. If you see raised around, use this sentence. In other words, put the nose in the nose hole or maybe you just change the nose, but don't put the nose in the ear hole. Right? There are some, like, basic grounds there. But then the last one is you start to give the kids Legos, and those are the SDRs that get really, really good. And that's when you're like, okay. You can write whatever you want in this email, and that's where the best emails come into play. But it takes time for an SDR to get there, and a lot of people make the mistake of giving their kids Legos on day one where they're putting the mister potato nose in the ear or something. Damn. I thought I was the king of metaphors. I was gonna say, wow. Just impressive. Mister potato head personalization. Alrighty, Paul. So this is all stuff on SDR workflow that we talked about. And I wanna make our way over to AE shadowing and ride along. So less stuff on workflow, more stuff on shadowing the closing process. So talk to me about, you know, first discovery call. You jump on as a sales manager. My guess is you're not being the motorcycle manager where you basically take over the call and you make your rep ride shotgun. How do you actually go about shadowing a call effectively as a sales manager? The first thing I wanna do is just set expectations with the rep. And normally, it's that, which is that, like, hey. I'm I'm here to listen. And and if you need support on anything, feel free to tap me in, but you run the show. From there, like, I'm really looking for some fundamentals typically at least to start. And when I say fundamentals, I mean, like, how are we opening the call over the first five minutes in terms of our prep, our agenda, you know, building rapport, and and setting the stage for the beginning of the call towards the end and all the way through the end of the call. I wanna see how we're leading discovery. I wanna see if we're saving time in the last five minutes to do a recap, take a temperature, and set a next step. But a lot of times, I wanna see first, like, some of the fundamentals of, like, how are we structuring the call, and are we setting ourselves up for success both in that call and in the next call? Great. So you come in with the right expectations. You know, they know why you're there. They know you're not there to take over the entire call. You jump onto the call. What are some of the things that you're looking for or the ways that you deconstruct a discovery call with your reps? One of the things I think is really important after we've set an agenda and an upfront contract, because we should be doing that every time, is I want the rep to come with a perspective and a point of view. I don't wanna hear people asking like, oh, like, what led you to take the call, or or why are you interested in talking today? I think that, like, we obviously wanna understand that, but we should be trying to share a perspective or a point of view on why people normally come to talk with us. Like, what challenges we typically hear, trying to understand if they resonate with this person or or if maybe, like, there's something else on their mind. But I think, like, not coming in with a blank slate and saying, like, hey. Tell me why you took the call, but really, like, doing a little bit of research or investigation upfront, even if you're just sort of forming a hypothesis and leading with that. So, like, hey. I I suspect maybe you're you're dealing with some of the challenges that I've heard from these other leaders. Like, I would love to talk more about them and and see if they're relevant or resonating with you. Are you a whisper mode guy where you're, you know, whispering in your reps' ear through the the call software? Are you a Slack person? Like, hey. Open up a Slack channel, and let's Slack back and forth about what's going on during the call, or are you like, let the call be, and I'll coach it afterward? You know, my very first sales manager was a whisper in my ear manager, and it traumatized me. So now I don't I do again. What I found is actually, like, talking to the rep about that beforehand. I like doing, like, Slack or Zoom chat, but, like, some reps prefer one or the other or get distracted by Zoom. And so if they wanna do that, I'm happy to and then sort of ping them questions or ideas or or food for thought while we go. Otherwise, yeah, I like doing immediate recaps after. Right? Like, let's talk about that while it's fresh. We'd love to hear how you grade yourself, what you might have done differently to to go up a grade or two, and let's try and do some in the moment coaching while it's, like, imprinted and and right at the forefront of your brain. Paul, you're seven minutes in. The call's going horrible. How do you determine when you step in and take it over, and how do you realize I need to let the rep work their way through it? I think the trigger for me to step in is if the prospect is actually getting mad. I think that's what I want to try and avoid at all costs is an actual upset prospective customer or a bad buyer experience. And so if it's clear to me that there's irritation or or frustration, like, that's when I I would probably step in and try and mediate. Otherwise, you know, unless they they call on me for help, I I wanna see how they navigate it and how they adapt. That's pretty unique because, I mean, the couple of places that I will jump in are if I feel like the conversation is really low and down in the weeds, sometimes I'll Slack my rep and I'll say, like, up, take it from here, which means I'm gonna ask a question up a higher level. And then the goal is for them to sort of keep it at that altitude in the conversation. Right? So I come in as the reset guy, or sometimes I'll come in as the story person if I feel like we're losing an executive that's being disengaged. Right? Mark, I'm curious for your take on this one. Are you sitting silent in the back, or are you more actively involved in calls, and how do you do that effectively? The first thing I do is I absolutely do what Paul does. And before the call, I want to know what my role is. Like, do you want me to say to you if it gets in trouble because you're nervous? Do you want me to just be a casual observer? You want me to just do stories? Like, what is my purpose in this call? And then what is the outcome that you wanna drive to? And where I start to get in is when I see that the outcome isn't going to happen. And I'm always got my radar. Like, are we on path? Are we on are there no roadblocks in a way for us to get where you wanted to get at this call? And when I get ten minutes in and I don't feel like we're making adequate progress for that, that's when I'll try to redirect, get us back on the path, and then let the rep come back in. But that that's my biggest one is I need to know what the outcome is. Otherwise, I don't really know what I'm doing in the call even if you tell me, like, be the story guy, Mark, or come in and do your thing, Mark, or, you know, have a fun intro, Mark, or whatever it is. Like, that's great. But, like, let tell me where you're going to so I can help you drive there. Paul, let's take it to the post call debrief. I see oftentimes the vomit wall of time stamp feedback, and that is an extremely ineffective way to give your reps feedback. How do you chunk up the feedback effectively so they actually take it and it's not demoralizing? I think and this can be a challenge for me at times. I think it'd be a challenge for a lot of folks when you see a lot of things to be worked on, but you gotta pick a thing at a time. And ideally, you pick the thing that's most impactful or the biggest issue that you that you noticed. Right? Whether that's a sort of lack of depth in discovery or it's sort of a poor expectation setting with the customer or it's a lack of booking a next call, but really keying in on one thing to focus on at a time. I'm with you. I think that, you know, there are millions of unread manager gongcom comments floating out in the, you know, SaaS universe somewhere. And so I think the more you can sort of bring that sort of coaching and feedback into the real world or into a live interaction, like, the more effective it's gonna be, the more it's gonna land, the more you can actually say it out loud to each other a few times to to make sure you get the marbles out of your mouth and actually make it stick. Well, Paul, amazing show. We have to go to the final question, and the final question is as follows. We talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit, and now it's time to talk about a bad one. So what is one bad habit that every sales leader out there should break so that all sales teams get a little bit better. Management by Slack. I think in today's world where it's virtual, we're on Slack all day. Like, we are way overstimulated and way overcommunicated on Slack. The reps are busy. They're on calls. They're stressed. They're trying to get stuff done, and the constant pinging of this, that, the other, deal feedback, coaching feedback, it just doesn't work. Right? I think, like, more time needs to be spent delivering and talking about the most impactful stuff live and leaving Slack to emergencies and and and, you know, nonessential stuff. If you are giving feedback over Slack, you are making a horrible mistake. Everyone on that notes, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alrighty, Mark. It's time for a two by two recap. What do you got for your two? Two by two. You know, sometimes you just gotta get reminded of the basics. Like, when I would coach kids in basketball, like, just reminding them to, like, pound the rock the right way was really impactful and, like, that shadowing reminder. It's so important to watch how your reps work. You take so much for granted in how they're doing stuff, and that shadowing completely busts away those blinders. I I thought that was just something I'd forgotten. It was awesome. And then number two is a goal without a how is not a goal. If you don't understand how somebody's gonna get there, then you giving them the goal setting exercise is setting them up for failure most of the time because most people don't know how to get to a goal. They just know how to set one to please their manager. And I love that, a tip at the very beginning where he talked about make sure you got the how in there. Number three, you should always be leveling with your AEs before you shadow a call with them and figure out what is the role that they want you to play, number one. And then two, what are your intentions behind joining the call? And then lastly, number four, I will plug my own takeaway, which was mister Potato Head personalization. You start them on the action figures, so they just pop them in. They just use the standard sequence, and then you move them to trigger templates, AKA mister Potato Head personalization. And then once they're really fancy and they can start building their own action figurines, now you graduate SDRs onto Legos, which is writing your own emails from scratch. And, folks, if you want to see, I have a massive LEGO sculpture in the background right here. You know why you can't see it? It's because you're only listening to thirty minutes to presidents club. If you wanna see thirty minutes to president's club, we are now on YouTube. And so you will actually see Mark teleport in this interview where he started on the outside, and then he moved to the indoors where there was slightly better Wi Fi. And so if you wanna see some magic tricks and see what my magic LEGO sculpture back there looks like, you should go check out the one and only YouTube channel for thirty minutes to present stub. Alrighty, folks. We'll catch you soon. See you on the next one.
