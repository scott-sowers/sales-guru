## Transcript

What's up? Jason Bey here from outbound squad. You can call me Jay Bey. I somehow convinced and sold the 30 MPC crew to let me hack the show today. They were pretty easy sell, by the way, between you and me. So what I want to talk to you about is multi threading. So big problem. Right? 78% of reps are single threaded on deals according to a stat to LinkedIn. And what I want you to think about is how many deals have you lost where you were never able to get access to power? Because user jams and Gong both have really interesting data around one. Win rates are 25% higher if we involve more stakeholders. So four, five, six plus people are getting involved in that deal. Our win rates tend to go up. And closed won deals have nearly twice as much stakeholder engagement as closed lost deals. So biggest concern that I hear and you might relate with this is people were really worried about going over their champion's head. What if I reach out to that person's VP or their chief so and so and it alienates them? What if they get offended and it completely shuts down the deal? And the reality of the situation is, I don't know about you, every deal I've lost, one of my biggest regrets was always we didn't get power involved. And I was too afraid to reach out to the folks or to suggest or push back on the prospect on why we should get more folks involved. The other reality too is that the prospect, no matter what they say, I'm gonna go talk to so and so. I'm gonna run this at the flagpole. They're probably not socializing it as great as you think they are. So what I wanna talk to you about in this playbook is we're gonna be breaking down how to get to power so that you're never single threaded on a deal ever again. We're gonna do that at in about ten minutes. So first thing that we're gonna talk about is the who. So who needs to get involved? And a key principle here is that it's easier to correct than to educate. So I wanna come up with a list of people I think should be involved. Two, we're gonna talk about the talk track, how to have that conversation with your point of contact or your champion. And three, I'm gonna give you some plays that you can run to multisread effectively. So three, two, one. Let's go. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright. Part number one, the who. So key principle again here, it's easier to correct than to educate. What you wanna avoid doing is asking a silly question like this. Hey, David. So who do you think would feel left out if they weren't invited to the next call? It makes the prospect to do all of the work. I wanna limit the amount of friction in this ask, And I do that by understanding something really important here. Okay. The way the buyer's journey works, there is a awareness, consideration, evaluation and decision. Okay. That's the buyer's journey Aware of a problem, I consider ways to fix this. And if this is a priority, I evaluate providers and then I make a decision. What doesn't get talked about is what happens after that post purchase. In software, it's, well, we said yes. Now we have to start and actually launch this thing. Right? So what I want you to do is think about yourself as a guide who is not an expert at getting deals to the finish line. You are an expert at helping prospects get a great outcome from your solution. K? So what you wanna think about is who are the key stakeholders that need to get involved in order for the outcome that your solution provides in order to maximize that. So key action item here. I want you to think about the last five to 10 deals that you've closed, and I want you to reverse engineer who was involved and when did they get involved. So think about, for me, a sales enablement manager oftentimes comes inbound, and then we're typically looping in sales leaders and frontline leaders. We're typically looping in a senior person like a SVP or a CRO. And what I want you to do with that information in every deal moving forward is you're going to research in advance of that call, the first call, especially potential stakeholders so that you can ask for them by name in that first call. Because, again, it's easier to correct you and say that's not the person than to just educate you on how their buying process works. Step number one. Alright. Step number two is the talk track. So the key principle here is we want to sell the outcome, not the deal. I'm gonna give you a quick talk track that you can use. So in that first call, especially if it's starting below the line with someone at a director or manager level, you're gonna simply ask them, have you evaluated or implemented a solution like this before? If they have, you're gonna ask them how long ago? What were you hoping to accomplish? Who was involved? Right? Get an idea of how that came together. In my experience, that's usually not the case in these first calls is you're usually talking to a buyer that doesn't have a lot of experience buying your solution. So what I wanna do is a couple of things. K? So I'm gonna talk one social proof. I'm gonna say something like this. I'm gonna say, hey, great. You know, we've actually gone through this process over a dozen times with sales teams at companies like Medallia, Gong, etcetera. Do you mind if I share how they were able to get their AEs to self source 30 plus percent of pipeline and how they got a really great result from a training project like this? Every time I ask that question, it's like, yeah, of course. You're going to ask them, Would you like to hear how other people like you have accomplished these really awesome results? You're going to say, Hey, from the most successful implementations of our training, what we've seen is that we're typically getting these folks involved. So number two, what you're gonna do is validate the stakeholder hypothesis that you created. So the people that you research that you thought would be a part of the buying process, I'm gonna talk about how it would be really great to get their perspectives. So I might say something like this. Hey. Typically so what we're doing is getting perspectives as frontline sales leaders. So directors of sales, I noticed that, Josh, it looked like heads up the US team, getting his perspective on what the AEs are dealing with right now and what they're experiencing and and all the struggles we're having with self sourcing pipeline is gonna be really key. Two, we're gonna talk to, probably an account executive or two to just get, like, frontline, what are they experiencing. And then three, we're usually getting your SVP, which looks like Katie or your CRO, Chris, involved at some point because they're gonna wanna know how does this align with their strategic priorities over the next six to twelve plus months. Are those the right people, or do you think that someone is maybe missing from that list? So I'm gonna validate who I think should be a part of the buying process. The goal here is that I'm coming in as a consultant and I'm guiding them and I'm coaching them on how to get a great outcome for my solution. You're gonna find that people are much more receptive when you approach the conversation that way. So that was step number two, the talk track. Step number three is the plays. K? So the concept here is I wanna warm up the buying committee. Alright? So there's three plays I wanna walk you through. One is a play that you can run prior to that first call. So let's say I'm meeting with a sales enablement manager, one play that I might run, because I know that we're gonna need to get a VP of sales or a CRO involved, is I might reach out to them prior to that call and letting them know that I'm gonna have a conversation with someone on their team. And that might sound something like this. Hey, Lindsay. Just letting you know we're scheduled to connect with, your SDR leaders this Thursday on how Acme can drive more meetings from the 15 BDRs and growing through more effective objection handling and effective messaging. No ask of you here. I'll be sure to provide an update after the meeting. So the key there is I'm probably not going to name drop a ton because that could turn some people off. I'm gonna let them know we're meeting with some people on their team, what it's about. I'm gonna let them know that I don't have an ask. Super important. The second play that you can run is threading power and keeping them in the loop. So if I reached out to that CRO or VP of sales, after that first meeting, I might send an email like this. Hey. I had a productive conversation with someone so on your team today about key initiative number one, key initiative number two. And then I'm gonna compliment the champion. Just wanna let you know Katie's really on top of her numbers. She's super focused, and it sounds like the SDR team's crushing it right now. We're meeting next week to discuss x y z. Again, no ask of you here. Wanted to keep you in the loop. So this is a great way to warm up the buying committee to start to loop in other people around the conversation. And this is how you get stuff to really get socialized internally, which is great. So third play is engaging additional stakeholders. So I think one of the big areas that people tend to make mistakes is they get really focused on selling to the group, and they don't focus enough on the individuals. So if you do a group call, let's say, on that demo and I get sales enablement, a couple sales managers, a director of sales involved, I may figure out, like, who has a lot of influence here and who would be good to have a one off conversation with. And we're just gonna reach out to them individually through email or through text. I'm just gonna say, hey. Great meeting you today. Appreciate the insight you shared around x y z. I was hoping that we could get some time before you meet with everyone again, next week. Would love your perspective on what's been the most challenging part from a frontline leader standpoint of getting your account executives to self source more pipe. You have fifteen minutes later today or tomorrow to connect on it. That's it. So those are the the three parts to this. So quick recap, the who, the big thing is that you need to create a hypothesis of who you think should be involved in the buying process so that when the time comes in that first call, you can suggest people getting involved and you could do it by name because it's easier to correct than to educate. Number two, talk track. I wanna sell the outcome, not the deal. So I wanna talk to my point of contact and the champion about why it's in their best interest to multi thread because it derisks the purchase. It helps them get a better outcome. And then three of the plays, I wanna loop in power early, I wanna keep power looped in, and I also wanna make sure that I take conversations one to one. Alright. That is all folks.
