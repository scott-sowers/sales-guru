## Transcript

Where's the hot spot in your deals where the most wins or mistakes are made, and how do I really nail it in the strike zone? So I'm gonna say this. I think it's two areas. I think you've got two spots where you have a significant impression on on the client. One is that first discovery call. I think the thoughtfulness of the questions you ask and the the kind of steps you prescribe really establish a sense for whether you as a sales professional are bringing something unique and valuable. I have had people buy from us who've told me, I've tried a variety of tools. Candidly, I think a variety of them are good. The difference here has been your sales rep because what they did was x with me from the start. They asked these particular questions. They really sought to understand what I was doing. They took the time to understand my reasons why. They could tell me my story back to me. When I put them in front of my boss, they were articulate about our business and made me look good. So that discovery piece, I think, is where I'm gonna say that's where you win, like, a lot of trust. And trust is really critical. And, hopefully, when you get later in the deal and you need to, like, ask something from that trust, you have the ability to do it. That would be one key zone. I think the second zone that comes up, and sorry to answer this in a two parter, but that's just how I'm thinking about this, is I think the second piece is leaving, like, a key role out of a deal. And here's what I mean. We've talked about, power and, like, a decision maker. We've talked about having IT involved in it. Having, end users is also critical and involved. You have to ask, what does the company want out of our solution, and are they gonna get it? And most executives these days, they wanna know, are my people gonna use it? So to me, the strike zone for us is is when we have an IT person who feels like their needs are being met, a business person who feels like its its needs are being met for the department, and we have some users who are giving that business person and the IT people a level of comfort that this is not gonna become shelfware. I think that's critical, and a lot of reps lean towards having just one or two of those things and then feeling good. I have reps who will just get the end users, and I always have to coach them to get to power. And some reps who get to power, and then they forget to get the end users involved. And I think you've gotta realize that this is holistic, and you need you need all those voices to really make your deal as airtight as possible. One place that I think trips reps up in this area because I think most people know on the surface, great. Somebody tells me something. I should be asking one or three or five follow-up questions about it. But a lot of times, we'll have buyers show up to the call, and they're like, hey. It's good to meet you. Like, the reason that I wanted to meet was we're looking for a conversational intelligence platform, and I'd love to hear what you all have to offer. And so when somebody presents that want, how do you recommend that reps reframe things to get that unique story? Because all they told you there is, we want a CI platform. What I love to do I call it, like, voice of the customer, so I don't give them my pitch. What I say is, hey. When I've met with people who are, you know, maybe it's a it's HR recruiting and they're coming in, they're looking for conversation intelligence around their volume of interviews and and whatnot. Mhmm. I'll typically say, hey. When I meet with someone who's in your role, these are three or four things that they're hoping to solve with a conversation intelligence tool. Where would you like us to anchor today? And that's where I can get them to start to tell their story. Right? It it it flips it back, and it's sort of like select from the menu what's most important. And they might say, you know what? All those are most important. I'd say, well, where would you like to start? You know? Pick one. Now we've got a priority. Interesting. Why did you pick that one? So I think there's ways to do that. And and, look, to me, it just comes down to, like, being human and and asking human questions. What happens when, you know, x is going on in the business? Almost get them to, like just think about them telling their story. Like, day in the life, where do you encounter this? Brian, I wanna go to the other thing that you mentioned, which is they're not getting enough people involved in the deal. I'm curious. Could you give an example where this has blown up a deal at Otter and what people should do? Like, who is the person you were single threaded with, and how did that actually end up blowing up in the deal, and what should they have done instead? I think there's two forms of this, and you have to be really, really mindful of both. And I think one is far more tempting to fall into into reps. And when when it doesn't work out, they are sometimes really caught off guard and shocked. The the two ways that that works out, I think, is one is that you have, like a an IT or a procurement or sort of like a a profess I'm gonna call them like a professional buyer. They may not be the end customer, but they're there as a representative on behalf of the company wanting to buy. And and, you know, that's great. We actually want those people involved. They are so important to every single, you know, business partnership that gets set up. But you wanna make sure that as you work with those people that you are identifying, I think a couple of things. With that particular persona, I like to give respect of what they need on the call. I like to understand what they're hoping to get out of the call, and I don't try to play coy and resist it. I wanna make sure that I'm gonna get them what they need. What I like to do upfront is I like to say, here's how we typically work with clients. And I will outline if it's somebody like this, I'll say, typically, we will meet with someone like you. We'll we'll make sure we get your initial questions answered. They might be around these categories of compliance or compatibility or security or just general control functions. And I'll say and then what's important is identifying who's gonna be using this, where the values come, and the the way that that takes place is we usually set up a follow-up demo where we will present to the business users that you know are looking for this, and we'll educate them, and we'll answer their questions directly. You know, does that sound, you know, agreeable? Sometimes they'll say yes. Sometimes sometimes they'll say no. If they say no, I think a great thing you can say is, I I get that, you know, you've gotta make sure that this is the right solution first. At the right point, would you be willing to introduce us to those people? If you hear yes, now you're thinking, great. Let me work with you to understand what is the right point so I can ask when that trust has been accrued. If you tell me no, I might pause and challenge and say, I'm gonna work with you today, but this is really concerning because I I just in the hundreds of clients I work with, I haven't had very many situations where where we haven't gotten these people involved. Could you tell me more about the hesitation? So there's a lot of ways to handle this that I think, again, you're not trying to be difficult. You're not trying to hold back. You want this person to walk away feeling a success because they have a job to do too. But you wanna establish that you have a job to do and that you know how this works in your business. And, hopefully, you can come together and mutually agree on a way that that that makes it a good experience for both parties. Hey, folks.
