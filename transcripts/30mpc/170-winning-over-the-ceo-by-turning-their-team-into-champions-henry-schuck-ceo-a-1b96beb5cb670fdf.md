## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Armon Faroque, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigalski. And today, if you have a Red Bull, a coffee, or pre workout, in my case, in your hand, Put it down, throw it out the window, and the reason for that is we got everything you need because it's the CEO of ZoomInfo. It's mister Henry Shuck, and he's lighting the show on fire today. Nick, why should people listen? Armand, you and I recently released a section of our newsletter called energy drinks with Nick because, apparently, sometimes I bring the energy, and I couldn't match Henry. He was phenomenal. This guy knows his stuff as it relates to selling, and he also is so good at infusing the way that he sells with conviction. And that is an underrated skill in sales. And so if you wanna learn from Henry some of his pet peeves when he's being sold to, ways to multithread, and how to actually sell with some energy. This one is worth the listen. And then these episodes are gonna give you some wings. And so a three, a two, a one, a whoosh. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Henry. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Okay. So my first one is push for the next step on a sales call, especially when things are going well, especially when you have good rapport with your prospect. So many sales reps get that good rapport. They just they feel so good about the rapport they built and where their prospect is telling them things are going that they don't do the necessary sales process steps. They don't ask for the follow-up. They don't ask how a decision gets made. They don't ask to bring power to the next call. So always set up the next step, especially when things feel like they're going in your direction. Beautiful. What's number two? Number two is when you get asked a question in the sales process and there is a yes or no answer to that question, always begin your answer by saying yes or no. And then if there's an explanation that's required after that, then give the explain. I see so many salespeople get asked the simple yes or no question, and instead of saying, yes, we do that or no, we don't do that, they go, well, let me explain first this then that and then we have this really special technology that does all this special stuff and so, yes, we do do that. And it just it frustrates prospects. You lose a tremendous amount of credibility because you didn't just tell them, like, yes. We do that, or, no. We don't do that. So answer yes or no questions with the yes or no first, then get into the nuance. Stellar. Round us out. What's number three? Number three is you should be leveraging job postings and the career page of your prospects or customers' websites before you get on a call with them every single time. Job posts are filled with interesting information about the company. You know, if our sales guys are going on a call, I'm asking them to look up the account executive job post, the VP of sales' job post, the director of sales' job post, that will tell you exactly what your prospects and your users are gonna be metrics against, of responsible for, held accountable for, and then you can go into a call and line that up. Hey. I looked at your job posting. It said that you're gonna be responsible for doing cold outreach, cold email, cold calling. Let me show you how 35,000 customers leverage us exactly for that. It's this key piece of intelligence that makes you more insightful, but also in a really easy effortless way tells your prospect you did some work before you showed up to the call. And it takes three minutes, and it creates a ton of credibility for you when you start that sales process. So, Henry, let's talk about this concept of sticking to the fundamentals, sticking to the good habits, breaking the bad habits. I wanna bring you to the beginning of a call. You and I jump on a discovery call. I'm a rep. I'm trying to sell you something. What is the most common fundamental or that area of discomfort that you oftentimes see reps breaking? Totally. This one's pretty easy. The number one thing I see reps doing is they show up and they actually feel like less than their prospect. Maybe you're, like, 27 years old and your prospect is a 40 year old VP of sales at this fast growing company and you think that because of their success that you're less than them so you gotta show up and just spew as much information as possible at them so they realize that you know what you're talking about, so that they realize, and I just say realize in quotes, that, you know, you're not just some young sales guy who doesn't know what they're doing. When in reality, at the beginning of that call, the number one thing you should be doing is asking questions. They should be informed questions, so you should have, like, looked at their website, understood who they are, thought about a customer example you wanted to share. That's really easy. You don't need to be an expert to do that, but then you show up and you ask questions. You ask questions to understand their business. You ask questions to to uncover a pain. You ask questions so that the rest of the call after that five minutes of questions can be tailored and specific to them. And if you get super nervous upfront and you never get to those questions and you're not good enough to hear the answers to those questions and then respond for the rest of the call with something that's specific around those responses, then you just show up looking less prepared and less specific to the prospect. So don't waste those five minutes by trying to just spew a bunch of information. Sit back, ask questions, try to really understand the business. When I go on sales calls today, you know, most of my time is spent trying to understand the customer's business and asking a whole bunch of questions about it. If there's a thirty minute call, twenty minutes of it is me asking question, tell me what's important, what's not going well, how is the team organized, how are you thinking about new customers versus existing customer growth. And then the last ten minutes, I go, okay. I've got a bunch of ideas about how I can help you. And that's a way more impactful call than let me just spit product information at you. I wanna talk about one of the hard moments in the beginning of that call. So you just talked about the idea of equal footing with your prospect. Because I bet you get on calls, Henry, where the sales rep is literally shaking, and you can tell they're they're terrified of you. And they lean into what they know, which is pitching their thing instead of actually trying to understand the business. And one of the ways you can inoculate against that is one of the things that you talked about earlier, which is showing up with, hey. I actually already looked at your your job posting, and here are some things I know about you, which is a great thing to do if you are someone who gets nervous because you can do that work when you're not live on the call. You can prepare some of those things. But there are times when you, as that 27 year old rep get on and there's that 45 year old VP, and they sorta hit you with a little bit of hardball where they say, you guys are ZoomInfo. I already know what ZoomInfo does. You don't need to ask me all these questions. Just show me a demo or just give me a quote. When you're a salesperson in that tough situation where someone you're senior is smacking you in the face, how do you recommend somebody responds to reset or reframe that conversation? Yeah. So I would lean on, you know, a couple of key talking points. Number one, I would probably say, like, hey. Listen. We see customers throughout a a whole spectrum of maturity levels. Some are like they just come in and they want company and contact information. That's all they need. Others wanna automate their go to market motion. And so what I wanna give you a quote for, I wanna try to understand where on that spectrum you are because for two things. One, I wanna give you a quote for what you actually need and two, I wanna tell you about things that are gonna let you get more value out of the ZoomInfo solution. I will tell you that the number one thing I hear from our customers is I didn't know you guys did that, and I wanna set you up to be in a situation where you never have to actually say that, where you know what we do and you're able to leverage it to get the full value out of our solution. And so I just wanna ask you a couple of questions to understand where you sit on that spectrum and make sure that I'm delivering the platform to you in a way that you can take the most advantage of it and get the most value out of it. I don't ever want you to be in a situation where in the worst case scenario, you go out and buy another vendor for something that you already paid for inside of ZoomInfo because you didn't know it did that. And so let me ask you a few questions to make sure that you're never in that situation. Henry, I wanna go down this path a little bit more. My guess is, especially when you're being brought into these big enterprise deals, you're not selling in absence of competition. Right? And my guess is when you're talking to a CRO of a massive multibillion dollar company, you need to find a way to differentiate that is probably not at the feature functionality level of we have this many more contacts or we have these two or three widgets that the other guys don't have. And so when I'm speaking at the CRO or at the CEO or at the COO level, how do you go about painting a different competitive vision without getting pulled down into the weeds? If I don't start upfront by asking you the things that are important to you, what the goals for this year are, where you think the organization is strong, where you think the organization is weak, where you see dollars slipping through your fingers, then I don't have an opportunity to tell you, like, I can solve that problem. I can solve that problem, and I can solve that problem. And, obviously, for ZoomInfo, data is at the foundational level of how I solve that problem, but software plugging into the motion is the actual tactical way that the problem gets solved. And so I'm listening for all of these key points that they're making about things that are gonna actually keep them from being successful in the next year. So, for example, someone might tell me, our sales reps don't have enough leads. Okay. That's a pretty basic one. And I might say, okay. Is it that they don't have enough leads or is it that they don't have enough good leads? And that might be two very different things and they'll say, well, marketing doesn't send us very good leads. Great. And how much is marketing spending to drive traffic to your website? Oh, a lot. We're doing this, content syndication, that, great. And so then I'm going, okay. Well, I know that out of a 100 people who come to your website, only one or two fill out a form on your website. The others are just anonymous. And so right then and there I'm saying, like, would it be beneficial for you to run a motion behind the companies that visited your website who didn't identify themselves? Yes. Great. That's a really valuable intense signal when a company comes to your website and you're not doing anything with it, but your marketing team has already spent the money to drive awareness and traffic to the website. Let's go look at that cohort and actually turn what is not a lead into an actual lead for your sales team, and I'll show you emotion about how to do that. But anything that they're telling me, I'm trying to craft a solution that leverages ZoomInfo to do that, and it's never it's never like, oh, well, we have 260,000,000 contacts, and our closest competitor has a 150,000,000 contacts. Like, wrapping your head around the difference between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and sixty million contact is next to impossible. And so I'm always looking at how do I solve your problems because, ultimately, if you're telling me it's a problem and then I solve it, there is value on the other side of that that's being realized that I can't realize if I'm just selling you company information and contact information. So this is all the best practice of when you see a rep or yourself selling to another executive well. I actually wanna ask you about when you are buying software or when someone is trying to sell to you. My guess is there are some people who do things extremely well like this, but my guess is there are some people who also lose you in the first five to ten minutes of the conversation, whether it's due to the information they're presenting or the quality of their questions. What are the common things that can lose the room with the CEO in the first ten minutes of a call? When I show up to a call, what I want you to be able to do is ask me some questions about my business that are not generic. You can't ask me, like, how big we are or, you know, what our revenue goal is or something that's, like, too broad. You know, like, I don't want too broad of questions. I want it specific, and you can have five minutes to do that. After that, ten even. But after that, what I really want is for you to give me some insights. Teach me something that I don't already know. Teach me something that you're seeing your best clients do. Teach me some way or some function or process that we're not running at ZoomInfo that best in class companies are, and couch it like that. Because if you can teach me something and then your product delivers that thing, I'm so much more likely to buy from you. And so ask me the questions and then delivered for me insights on how I can better run my business or better run a process in my business. And, obviously, for you, bonus points if that aligns with what your product delivers for me. That's what I want. You know? Ask me questions, deliver me insights that I didn't know. Outside of that, I'm not really looking for anything else in that sales call. And if I walk away going like, they're super smart and very insightful, and they're clearly delivering value for the best companies in the world, I definitely wanna do business with them. I think this is where a lot of sellers screw things up is they say, alright. I've got thirty minutes with Henry on the books, and they always get taught, I've gotta run great discovery. And what they end up doing is they drag you through twenty seven minutes of discovery, and you end the call and you're like, I don't really know what you do. I can give a tip here, Nick. If you're coming to a call with me, that means you've had many calls with our team before you showed up on my call. You need to turn my team into your champion. And so in that run up, you need to be sitting down with my team and saying, hey. Got the call with Henry. It's in three days. Tell me how calls with Henry go. What does he care about? Does he know about these things? Who are the companies that he respects the most? What is he gonna respond to in the product the most? Is there some initiative he's talked about internally that aligns to this solution that we can be talking about? And then even if you show up and you go, hey, Henry. I spent a good amount of time with your team and what they told me was you care most about these five things. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Is that right or would you add anything or take anything away from this list? I am yours. Right? Like, I'm totally engaged at that point. The five things are gonna be pretty aligned with my with what I care about because my team gave it to you. But if you're not taking an opportunity to turn my team into, you know, g two operatives for you, you're just totally missing that. Now, what I tell my team all the time is to do this, but to think about us as partners all of a sudden. Because in a sales process, I'm the seller, you're the buyer, sometimes it feels adversarial. When you're going up the ladder, that is the best opportunity to change the perspective of the sale from like me trying to convince you to us trying to convince the next ladder up. You all of a sudden can you can take an opportunity to become teammates in the sales process. You have a champion. Don't forget that they can be your partner and your teammate as you go up the ladder. I think so many people, like, don't change perspective mid cycle. They keep on operating like it's, you know, me versus you. I'm trying to get you to my side. You've won the champion if they're opening the door to the VP or the CEO. Now get them on your team. I wanna ask you. You mentioned earlier this idea of teaching the other person something that they didn't already know. And I'm wondering if you can voice over what that might sound like because I'm thinking about a world where I get super, super granular and maybe even too in the weeds. I'm also thinking about in a world where I turn it into too much of a product pitch where it's like, you didn't know that our products can do a, b, and c, and they feel like I'm, like, just pitching and pushing. And so I'm wondering if you can give me some pointers on the teaching the other person something they don't know and what that should look, sound, and feel like. Yeah. There's one that we use often here at ZoomInfo that's just, like, very easy. So I'll go people who fill out a form on your website, would you agree that they are the best possible buyers of your products and services? They've come to your website. They've read some pages. They filled out a form. That's the best showing of intent. Can we agree to that? Yeah. Totally. Definitely. Great. How quickly do you think you're responding to leads that come through your website? And almost without fail, people will tell me, like, we're not very good at that, maybe a day, maybe two days. What if I showed you research that tells you that if you get back to a person within five minutes of them filling out a form on your website, it 10 x is the likelihood that you will close that business. And then I'll show the research, and then I'll go, let me show you how you could leverage ZoomInfo to get back to every person who fills out a form within ninety seconds of them filling out a form, and I'll show you how we do it. And so then it's like it's exactly that. Like, identify a problem. Hey. We're not responding to leads fast enough. Every CRO is gonna tell you that. Provide the insight. Hey. When you don't do that, you're actually leaving money on the floor and this is just a process change. You know, it's not, like, that hard to respond to lead that fill out forms on your website. And then let me just show you how best in class companies do that using ZoomInfo. You don't have to feel that way. Right? You don't have to feel like you're bad at this thing. We can help you be really good at it, and it turns into money for you. As someone who is starting as a new rep, maybe it's my first time selling to revenue leaders, maybe it's my first time selling for a company like ZoomInfo. It takes some chutzpah to be able to go to a CRO and earn the right to be like, I'm gonna tell you that your time to first touch is garbage, or I'm gonna tell you that you're burning leads or you're wasting time on the wrong leads. How do I get to that level of industry knowledge and technical proficiency to be able to go toe to toe and actually have an executive who probably has 20 of experience than me? How do I actually get them to hear me out and command the room as someone who might be a mid market or enterprise seller in their first couple years of selling? Yeah. The way that I would do this is I would show up at my new company. I'd ask who are the best sales reps at the business, and then I'd go listen to their calls in Chorus or whatever you use for conversation intelligence. I'd go listen to those calls, and I'd watch them in front of the most senior revenue leaders in the world, and I'd listen very closely to exactly what they say, how they say it, and then this is the missing piece, and then I would practice out loud doing the same thing. Because what so many people get wrong in the learning process in sales is they can hear something a 100 times and when they actually go to say the words out loud, it's like a disaster the first time, the second time, the third time, the fifth time. And so the best thing you can do is number one, hear what great sounds like and then hear yourself out loud sound great. And if you can do those two things, you're, like, endlessly powerful in the sales process. Phenomenal. Henry, I wish we had more and more time, but we are running out on the clock. So we gotta move to the final question. The final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I'm gonna ask you about a shouldn't. And so the final question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? So I will tell you, there's a sign in the ZoomInfo office that says, if you feel comfortable on all your calls, you're doing something wrong. And I really believe that sales is actually a process where you're getting rid of bad habits. You have all of these bad habits that are built up because social interactions and interactions with your friends and interactions friends and interactions with your family, you're not selling. You're just being yourself. You're not trying to persuade someone to an outcome and so you've got a bunch of habits built up, you know, not challenging, not persuading, not being passionate about your point. If you go ask any of my friends, they'll tell you that the thing that they love most about me is that doesn't matter what the issue is, I am, like, all the way in on it. You could say, like, the, you know, the three second rule in paint in the paint in NBA and I don't know that much about it, but give me a few minutes and I'll have a passionate viewpoint on one side or the other of it. And that's not very natural to any seller. You so you have these habits that are built up in your social life and in your day to day experiences that you have to break. Asking, you know, pinning somebody down on follow-up when they feel like your best your biggest advocate. That's just a bad habit that you're probably not doing that you need to break. You know, not asking them to bring power to the conversation because they feel like such a great champion of yours and they tell you right up the get go, I get it, Henry. I get the value of ZoomInfo. Let's just get this deal done. Not pressing that person is a bad habit that you have to break and I think that sales great salespeople know that there are a whole whole bunch of bad habits that they need to break. Like, when I first started selling at ZoomInfo, I would have a voice in my ear every time I felt uncomfortable. And every time I felt like not doing that thing, that voice in my ear would just be like, do not not do the hard thing here. Do not not do the hard thing here. And then I would be embarrassed if I wouldn't do it, and so I would do it. And we will, like, worked in a big hallway where the other sellers that I was telling, like, hey. Do the hard things could hear me. And so I had to be a great role model, and so that was a great push. But you need to have that whisper in your ear every time you feel uncomfortable, every time you feel like you're you're gonna step over the line that tells you step over the line, have the hard conversation, do the uncomfortable thing over and over and over and over again because that's how you clear out those bad habits. Holy smokes. What an amazing episode. Henry, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else.

And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Henry Shuck include, number one, do not let the fear of breaking rapport prevent you from sticking to your sales fundamentals. That might mean if rapport is going super well and you have a minute left to book your next call, book the next step. Number two, answer yes or no questions and shut up. That's it. Number three, figure out their vision through discovery first, and then tell the story of their business in terms of how other world class teams use you to achieve that exact same vision. And lastly, number four, turn the CEO's team into champions before you meet with Henry. In other words, you should be using the department leads or your champions to get the inside scoop on the economic buyer. What do they care about? What pisses them off in meetings? What's important to them? What are the types of things that go well or don't go well when you meet with this person? Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Don't help us out. Send Henry a thank you. If you got some value from this episode, send him a note on LinkedIn and let him know that you enjoyed his appearance on the show. He took a lot of time out of his day to prepare for this episode and join us, and so it would mean a lot to us if you send him a thank you and told him to hurt him on 30 MPC. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on this podcast.
