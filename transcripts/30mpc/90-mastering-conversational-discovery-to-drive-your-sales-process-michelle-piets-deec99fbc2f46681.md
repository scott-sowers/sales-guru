## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the one and only VP of Revenue, O'Grad, the one and only, Dooley, and the one and only, Michelle Peach. Nick, why should people listen? This was a wonderful discovery lesson, and one of the things Michelle does a really great job of is getting into, like, conversational discovery. So if you've ever felt, like, stiff and stuffy where you're like, I've gotta lead with my upfront contract, like, she does things a little bit differently, and this was a really great discovery episode. Three, two, one. Cool. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busywork like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, Michelle. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Number one, don't go into a call blind. Make sure you know where you're walking into. Know your prospects' industry, the company, and focus on two to three pain points that you can potentially solve prior to getting on the call with them. Beautiful. What's number two, Michelle? Prospecting. When you're prospecting, you always wanna customize your messaging. So do your research, understand who you're reaching out to, potentially go to their Twitter if they have one, and find an example that you could make your messaging applicable to them. And then tailor your messaging that ties back to your solution and something that is exciting to them. Very nice. Round us out, Michelle. What's number three? Number three. Don't be afraid to ask the hard questions. I know this is really difficult, especially when you're building great rapport, but you have to ask the tough questions around next steps and what their process is to buy. This will help you and your prospect have a better sales process along the way. Alrighty, Michelle. So I know you came from Drift in the past. I know you're at Dooly now. And one of the big things you focused on is conversational discovery. Less of the rigid upfront contract, more of just having a conversation. One of the things that's hard is when you're pushing for next steps or when you're negotiating with someone, I have to ask the hard questions, and it sort of breaks that conversational barrier at times. And so how do I ask for next steps and hold my prospects accountable without seeming like an annoying sales rep? Yeah. Absolutely. So asking for next steps is difficult, especially when you're having this great conversation and you've built really great rapport. You feel as though, like, you probably got the deal, but you never wanna leave the deal hanging. And it's easier to ask for next steps, especially if you have a call that you need to be scheduled. Ask them if they have their calendar open. And for me, we were all I've sold to salespeople, and we can tie it back to, hey. I'm gonna put my sales hat on here. Let's get some next steps on the calendar. What's the best way to get somebody on the books in the next week or two so we can wrap this up? And you can use that to play the game, and everyone on the sales side, they get it. And you're almost you're not doing your job unless you have next steps, and that's the biggest thing for a sales leader too. I'm always asking, what are your next steps? And it's best for you to have an agreed upon next step with your prospect. What you're doing there is in past episode, we called it the humbling disclaimer where you're just taking all the worries in your mind, and you're putting it out on the table. You're basically saying, like, hey. I gotta put my sales hat on. Or something I've used in the past is, like, my manager is gonna kill me if I don't have another meeting on the books here just even though I totally trust you. And so could I bug you and, like, get thirty minutes back on the calendar just so we make sure this thing goes through? And by calling that out as opposed to just pushing for thirty minutes, pushing for thirty minutes, you're far more relatable and also just personable than a traditional salesperson. Exactly. You're adding that human aspect to the sales cycle. And most people don't necessarily like to have that aggressive sales tactic anymore, especially these days where you can buy things without even actually talking to anyone. So add that human aspect to the process and say, like, Hey, listen, My manager is gonna ask me what's happening with this deal. It seems as though we have agreed upon next steps. We're a good fit for you. Let's get something on calendars. Your calendar open right now. Michelle, I feel really closely tied to the next steps is understanding the customer's process to buy. And this is an area that I really struggle to get out like, to understand from the from the customer's perspective because I I know what my typical sales process looks like. But sometimes I don't fully understand, like, what the customer needs done. And so I feel sort of awkward, especially if I'm talking to someone who might not be, like, the final signer of the deal. Like, so what's your process to buy this thing? And so I'm wondering, how do you artfully uncover that? Yeah. That's a great question, and that's something that we're always dealing with. And I think it leads to proper discovery early on in the sales cycle. Depending on how long your sales cycle is, it could be, you know, fourteen days to a hundred and eighty days. But starting to plant the seed early on in that discovery process so early, who else needs to get involved? If we're gonna be doing a trial, who else is gonna be doing the trial with us? Who do you typically work with when you're buying something? When was the last time you bought something? And depending on if there's going to be security, procurement, legal, you already know that there's going to be a much larger process towards the end of the deal. So you should tack on those dates and understand, like, what that process is to achieve everything on those dates. So one area that I've kind of struggled with, because I feel like I'm I'm pretty good at discovery, is I'm having a conversation with a prospect, and I, like, I keep uncovering pain with the thing that I'm, like, going to replace, like, that that my product can help with. And so, I guess, when I think about discovery, I wanna understand the pain that I solve for first, but I also need to discover the buying process. And so, like, at what point should I just stop asking questions about the problem that I solve and start to switch more towards, like, understanding the deal logistics. When you have the pain and you've created that moment, that's where you can go in and start asking, what's your typical process internally? Depending on the size of the company, let's let's call it an enterprise deal. We typically have to go through legal security and procurement. Can we start to get red lines going? And that will give you an indication if they know what their process is internally and what it's gonna look like on your end as well. And then you should also ask your prospect when the last time they purchased something and what did that look like for them. It depends on their title and if they need to get other people involved. So right now, I'm dealing with lower totem pole typically where our champions have never bought anything. So they need to go internally and figure out what their process is. So right then and there, we know we probably have to get their manager sign off. Their manager needs to get someone else's sign off. But asking that, like, how can I help you move this deal through your process internally? What does that process typically look like? So could you help me understand a little bit better? Because sometimes where reps screw up is they'll give a discount at the end of the month, and it'll be like the last week of the month, as you know, and I see a smile. And the problem is the customer would be like, great. I can close this month or I can have a decision this month, but my entire legal team now needs to be involved. And so can you talk about, like, when you get into a deal, you know it's the first week of the month. How does the timeline of all of those other events play out? In other words, how do I start to project manage my timeline and make sure that I time commercial terms exactly in line with, like, all of the other stuff that needs to be done to get a deal done. Mhmm. Yeah. You said one thing there, though, that I wanna touch on. Your champion says I can make a decision this month. That's not I can sign this month, and that is a big difference when you're forecasting your deals. And, okay, you can make a decision this month. Great. What does that look like internally? What goes into that decision making process? And if you have built the rapport and you know that you have a pain and you can solve that pain, you have every right to ask that question. And once you get the answer, okay, well, typically, I can make a decision. That means I have to go to x, y, and z. I can get a decision by the fifteenth of this month. Right? Okay. What happens after the fifteenth of this month? We typically have to go through legal. And then you back into that process depending on the date that you want signature. If they tell you that it's going to be forty five days out, don't throw a discount in to get it in just because you are assuming that they can get it in by the end of the month when realistically, it's still gonna take forty five days and you have a discount hanging up there. So working with your prospect, identify those dates, and then make sure you have check ins to make sure we're still on track. So I wanna dig in on this. Let's say I've done it the right way, and I've gotten my agreement in the first week of the month. I've gone through procurement, legal, what have you through the rest of the month. And then the thirtieth of the month passed, and the first strikes and a contract is not signed. And let's say I gave a discount. One of the things that I find reps have a really hard time doing is saying that's not in place anymore. But how do I do that in a way that doesn't just totally blow up the deal where it's like, hey. You were three days late. Now you have to pay $20 more. Sure. That's a great question, and that's tough because it's situational. Right? What happened? Why didn't they sign? And have you been in constant communication with your prospect? I've had certain situations where we're dealing with sea level and something tragic happened on the other end. So we were able to get the deal signed. A few days later, we gave it to them because it was you have to be a human in that instance and understand what happened. If you're completely ghosted, there's something something happened that you didn't know about that probably impacted the deal. So I would make sure, you know, competition, you know who the signer is and is the signer in agreement well before you toss that discount out for the the thirtieth of the month because there's always other players in there that you might not know about. So you need to make sure you have all your bases covered. Michelle, I wanna take this sort of all the way back to the beginning of the discovery process because One of the things that you told me when we were preparing for this interview is, like, you're not super, like, rigid, Sandler, like, crazy upfront contract in the beginning of the discovery call. A big piece for you is, like, you want it to be a conversation, but you also are pulling things out that you need from a sales discovery perspective. And so I'm wondering if you could sort of break down, like, when you're going into an initial discovery call with someone you've never really spoken with before. Yeah. Absolutely. So you're both taking time out of your day to talk about your solution and figure out if your solution can solve something that's broken or a pain that's on your prospect side. So always have that in the back of your mind that you're trying to identify the pain and tie it back to what we offer. If you don't identify that, then it's a waste of time. You want to get some metrics that you can always toss back. I call it I call it the golden nuggets. Always have those golden nuggets in your back pocket to toss back to the prospect if things start to go awry at the end of the sales cycle. So you always wanna help them find an moment and asking open ended questions and sprinkling them across the actual discovery call and not just badgering them with questions. We're lucky we saw the salespeople. I've also sold to tech and engineers, which is drastically different. So you have to identify how they like to communicate to and know how much time you have with them. Salespeople are a little bit easier where they're they understand that the value that we're gonna show them, like, relatively quickly. But for the engineers or someone that's not necessarily in sales, it goes back to doing your research and understanding the pain that you're gonna solve relatively quickly. So asking them if you were to change one thing with x, what would it be? Or what happens if you fail to achieve x? What's your biggest challenge when it relates to whatever? And having them open up, the biggest challenge is a question that I ask almost all the time, even in interviews, gets them to open up, and it gets them to think about, I do have a challenge, and this is my challenge here. And it's open ended questions. You wanna keep it with, like, two or three open ended questions. Do not ask a question that results in a yes or a no. And, also, don't ask leading questions. That's I hate that. Leading questions. Okay. For example. So let me guess. Does your manager hit you up for your forecast and your managers all over you about it? Yep. Yeah. You just gave it to them. You just gave it to them. Like, don't ask leading questions. You want your prospect to start to think a little bit more about their current situation. Well, part of the reason that leading question is is horrible is, like, you're trapping them into saying yes. And the customer is like, well, of course the answer to that is yes. And I know when I answer that question yes, you're gonna go, oh, well, now Dooly's perfect for you. And it's like, how could anybody answer no to that question? So, Michelle, you shared a couple, like, not to dos when it comes to a discovery call. You talked about not doing any research, like, going into that conversation blind. You talked about asking, like, yes, no questions because they sort of just shut down the conversation. It's a one word answer. And then you also talked about, like, the leading question where it's like, of course, the answer to this is yes. I'm wondering if there are any other, like, common discovery pitfalls that you've seen reps run into because you've managed a lot of reps, and I I imagine you've seen some ugly stuff and also some great stuff. I think people get caught up in following a script, which is awful. Like, you're if you have 20 questions and you're just like, boom, boom, boom, boom because you know that you need to get those questions answered, You sound like a robot and no one wants to talk to a robot. So that's why I mentioned, like, figure out two or three key questions that you know that you can get the answers to that will help you move the sale forward and sprinkle in the aspects of your solution that you know that will resonate with your prospect and ask them try and get on their level like, Oh, is this something that you think you could use? Is this something that you deal with every single day? Because this is what I deal with it every single day too. It's such a pain and just being adding more of that human element and having empathy to most people just focus on that script and you're just a robot and you're not listening when you do that. You have to listen. You have to pick up what they're throwing down too. You have to read their body language. Hopefully, everyone's using Zoom. I think that adds more of that human aspect to the discovery or just overall building the relationship. But having empathy, listening to your prospect. I listen to Gong calls all day long. I only listen to, like, the first eight minutes because that's when they should be doing their discovery. And within, like, the first two minutes, I know they just missed that pain and they they'll move on. And if they mention one thing, just focus right there. And you can start to build a relationship and build a rapport by asking more questions around the pain. For example, our prospects will tell them, like, it's a massive pain to take sales notes in Salesforce. Tell me more about that, man. I hear you. I have to do it all the time. And my my manager, she's all over me. So tell me more about that. It's kind of funny what you said about, like, the prepared script versus having two to three questions, like, that you have in your back pocket. I remember my first ever discovery call. I was, like, a brand new sales rep, and I got on the call. And my VP of sales was Slacking me questions to ask while the conversation was happening. And so it was honestly the worst call that I've ever had in my life because, like, I I was trying to listen to the customer and, like, act normal, but I'm also hearing, like, I didn't know how to shut off the Slack notification noise. So I'm hearing the ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. And I'm, like, looking at questions, and the person must have thought I was a complete freak because the conversation was so jagged. And so what I started to do after that was what you mentioned earlier, where, like, I prepared two to three I don't know. You could call them, like, keystone questions where it was like I did some research. I looked on their their website and, like, oh, okay. You guys recently had a an online event, and I bet there was some sales, like, motion tied to that I'm curious about. So, like, what I tried to do is prep, like, really good, insightful questions that I could ask at any time, almost no matter where the conversation was because sometimes I still struggle with that where I'm like, wait. I'm supposed to be going in a certain direction. It actually it ties back to I remember when I was in high school, I went on a date, and I was so nervous. I prepared some questions to ask in advance. So exactly my life. That's smart, you know, in case you get stuck. But I think you should always prepare for any sales call, especially if you might not necessarily know what you're getting yourself into. Because I go back into the selling of I. T. And that was tough. Some of the engineers crickets. There's no rapport building. They don't really wanna be asked any questions. So you have to have, like, a key flow in your back pocket that you can always turn back to. And, honestly, sometimes it's just like, cool. So what brought you here today? What can I show you? What's happening in your situation? And I'll write into it. It goes back to, like, reading their body language, hearing what they're saying. If they're not having a conversation with you, if they're they just don't wanna have it, they wanna see the the powers of your tool, probably because they checked out our competition, then just go in for it. So this reminds me of of one last thing that you actually mentioned in passing at the end of the process where sometimes you'll get people who, like, they're just trying to check the box in competitors or whatever, or they're just trying to, like, find the lowest price or whatever it might be. And, if we go all the way back to the end of the process again, I don't know if we've ever talked about, like, best practices for managing procurement, which are sort of like the emperors or empresses of, like, having no agency in what you do whatsoever. And literally, the only purpose of that conversation is to get a deal done in the most favorable terms for their company. And so do you have any best practices for managing those procurement folks? I can tell you to trust their internal process. We try and get deals in, so we try and go around people and we try and get creative. And if you burn the procurement contact by going above them or trying to get creative, you're going to make your life a lot harder. So trust their internal process. I would stay firm with whatever discounting you have in place at your organization because I have very strict discounting. We will not discount. There's specific threshold that you have to hit before you get a discount, and you hold firm. That's your process internally. If they're telling you that so and so in procurement is going to be reaching out to you on Thursday, should hear back from them by 1PM. And this is their process. They're gonna send you this document. You need to sign sign this document within twenty four hours, and then that's it. Well, it's Thursday at four, and you're hitting up procurement. You're hitting up the CFO. You're hitting up procurement. It's like, no. I told you. Like, I would get back to you, and this is why I didn't get back to you. And now go pound sand. I'm gonna take my time. Just listen to them. And I think the key thing is with working with procurement, you have to have a really, really good champion. That champion that's willing to go to bat for you, if procurement is slowing down the process, you have a good champion. They're they're willing to walk into procurement and say, like, hey. This is the project that we're signing this deal for, and we're coming up against our timeline. And if you don't have that champion, you're kind of stuck because you have to follow procurement. And depending on what the situation is, there's probably there could be a deal above you that needs to go sooner. They're gonna focus on that. Or a stronger champion on the other side, they're gonna focus on that. Build that champion, number one. Michelle, this has been phenomenal. I've got a a page and a half worth of discovery notes. Look at that. I take my notes here. But we gotta move to the final question. We're we're running out of time here. So the last question is this. We've talked about a ton of really good habits that salespeople should be doing. Now we gotta talk about a bad habit here. So my question for you is, what's one bad habit that you see from a lot of salespeople that they need to stop doing and throw in the trash because it's hurting them more than it's helping? The biggest thing that I've come across with managing hundreds of sales reps, never they never get the next step. They never get, like, a firm next step. And it's always, well, I'm gonna reach out Tuesday to book my next step. So we had them on a call last week. Why didn't you ask them? Why are you waiting five days? The longer you wait, the longer it's going to take. And you're also opening up the opportunity for your prospect to go look at other people. When it's top of mind, you you have to go in and capitalize on that, get that next step. Is your calendar in front of you? Can I get on a call with you? Understanding what their process is internally and outlining that in an email with agreed upon next step, outlining your call, what you identified, the solution that you're gonna provide, and your next steps. Super easy. Beautiful. Well, the next step here is anything you wanna plug before we jump off, Michelle? Dooly. Salespeople, use Dooly. It will make your life easier.

Michelle, thank you so much for coming on the show, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Michelle Peach include, number one, when you're asking for next steps, it's okay to use a humbling disclaimer. It might sound like I'm gonna put my sales hat on, but here's what we need to do to get this done. Number two, once you get the moment in your discovery, those two or three problems you can solve, that is a great time to ask about their buying process, who needs to be involved, what have you. Number three, when you're giving a discount and it doesn't happen at the end of the month, you have to figure out what happened in order to determine whether or not you're gonna pull that discount. If it was like a tragedy or if there was something big at the company level that they could not control, then you might give them a break. But if they just ghosted you or they were looking at competitors, you might not. And then lastly, number four, stop asking leading questions. Lead with your open ended questions. Alright, Nick.
