## Transcript

What's going on? Jason Bey here. You can call me J Bey. I'm here for a thirty minutes to president's club playbook fundamentals episode. And today, we're gonna talk about cold calling. So cold calling has an average success rate of about one point four eight percent according to Gong. And, I don't know about you. When you start to do the math at 1.48%, you start thinking about all the conversations that you have to have, especially if you're an account executive to actually land a meeting. So what I'm gonna teach you in three parts today is how world class sales professionals increase their cold calling success rates to 30 plus percent. So instead of converting one and a half out of every 100 prospects they talk to, they're gonna convert one out of every three into a qualified meeting. So these are the same tactics I've taught reps at companies like Gong, Zoom, Medallia, and many more. So we're gonna break this down into three parts. So first is the first sixty seconds. So I'm gonna teach you how to succeed where eighty plus percent of reps fail. Second thing we're gonna talk about is what I call the hook. So this is the middle part of the call. How do we create urgency by finding problems so the prospect wants to meet now? And then lastly, we'll talk about how to say goodbye and eliminate no shows. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI power the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. So let's dig in. So part number one, the first sixty seconds. So this is where cold calls are won and lost. In the typical cold call, according to chorus.ai, lasts only about eighty seconds, and only 10% of them one out of every 10 lasts longer than two minutes. So our objective with the intro is to earn more time. This is really important. Your mindset in the very beginning of the call, don't think I need to land a meeting. It comes out and it's really desperate. You're gonna start pitching. You're gonna start doing all of these things. Our goal is to earn more time. So you wanna avoid these approaches that I'm about to share with you. These are conversation stoppers instead of conversation starters. So if you open up and say, hey. This is Jason. I was calling about sales training at x y z company. Don't talk about your solution. Hey, I wanted to inquire if recruiting is top of mind for you right now. I wanted to see if you're interested in exploring our recruiting platform. Have you heard of XYZ company before? How's your day going? All of those are really terrible ways to start a conversation because you're burning up precious real estate at the very beginning by talking about yourself. So what we wanna do here, and it's called a pattern interrupt, is we're gonna use what's called a permission based opener. The concept here is that the prospect didn't ask you to call them. You're an unexpected interruption, and what we're gonna do is we're gonna ask them if they'd like to opt in and participate in the call with us. So two pointers real quick on tonality, and then I'm gonna give you five examples of ways that you can open up the call that start a conversation instead of stop the conversation. Pointer number one in tonality is be friendly. The goal here is to be incredibly hard to be an asshole to. Alright? The simple hack, and you can probably hear it in my voice right now, is to smile when you talk just like if you were approaching the person or a stranger in public. Hopefully, you'd have a smile on your face and not look like a like a crazy creep that's, looks like you're about to rob the person. Okay? So smile. The second thing is no uptalk or customer service voice. So you wanna remove upward inflection, high pitched tones, and unnecessary formality. You hear what I did there? That doesn't sound very confident when I say upward inflection. You know I'm calling from outbound squad. Remove the upward inflection. You're not on the phone with your insurance provider. Okay? So we don't have to be super formal formal here. Conversational is what we're going for, so remove uptalk and customer service voice. So here's five variations of the permission based opener that you can try. One's the classic. I use this one a lot. Hey, David. It's Jason. I know I'm catching you in the middle of your day. Do you got a minute for me to share why I'm calling? And you can decide if you wanna keep chatting. Number two is the Gong opener. I learned this during my time working with Gong. I listened to a ton of recordings of them calling senior leaders, and they would get a little bit of a chuckle out of this. The tonality is super important. Hey, David. It's Jason with App on Squad. I don't suppose I caught you at the worst possible time, did I? Number three is starting with relevance. So, hey, Jesse. I'm calling about all the hiring. It looks like you're doing it in Canada right now. Oh, by the way, it's Jason with Outbound Squad. Do you got a minute? Promise to be brief. Number four is Armand Farrokh's opener. So if you've listened to this podcast for a while, you've probably heard his style of opener. Have you heard our name tossed around? Hey, Heather. You know, we work with a few other construction firms here in Austin, Texas. It's Jason at Outbound Squad. Have you heard our name tossed around? And the disarmingly blunt opener is number five. Really like this one. Hey, Chelsea. It's Jason. You're gonna hate me. I'm cold calling you. So please feel free to hang up on me if you need to. I was just hoping I could get 30 to explain why I was reaching out. So those are your five openers. K? The way that you can put this into action, relisten to this, pick one of them to listen to, or download the playbook in the asset in the, in the link here. So pick one of those PBOs and practice a few dozen times out loud and start using them in your cold calls. K? So that's part one of the intro. That's one half of the first sixty seconds. Nailed the permission based opener. The second half is using what I call a reverse pitch. So prospect says, yeah. Go ahead, Jason. What's going on? You're gonna be really tempted, and you need to resist every urge in your body to pitch. You're gonna be very tempted to say something like, oh, I wanted to see if we could help with you know, I'm calling from ABC company, and we help. We're a blank solution, and I'm calling to schedule a demo. Don't do any of that kind of stuff. The prospect, their guard is gonna immediately go up when you do that. We're not gonna do those things. Okay? So let's resist the urge to pitch. Let's go very smooth here. And what we're gonna do is this reverse pitch, we're just gonna simply share what we hear their peers working on. K? It's gonna sound something like this. So prospects like, yeah. Sure. What do you got? Great. You know, typically, when I speak with ecom leaders like you, they tell me they're focused on one of two things. One is continuing to improve brand reputation, so helping their customers get more immediate and high quality human interactions. And the second thing is expanding their repeat customer base. So they're trying to find a sweet spot between, you know, chatbots and human support that drives LTV and and really great brand reputation. Does that sound like your world at all? And then the prospect, again, if we've talked about something that is really top of mind for people like them and their peers, now it's game on. We've talked about something that's relevant. K? Now at this point, we haven't talked about what we do yet. We're trying to get them to ask us. K? So think about the last five to 10 conversations that you've had with prospects and think about what are the top two priorities that if I put a 100 of those prospects into a room, they would all agree that these one to two things are very important to them right now or this year. Part one, first sixty seconds where most reps fail is they do not use their permission based opener, and they pitch instead of using a reverse pitch. Let's dig into part two, the hook. So what do we do with this middle part of the call? Our goal here is to find problems and create urgency. So at this point, we've made it where most cold calls fail, and it's time to hook the prospect to create interest and desire to schedule a meeting. So what we wanna do here is really find out current solutions and similar problems. So how are they getting the job done right now, And then what problems do they have in common with their peers? So the best way to find those problems is to ask for them. But just remember, when you're asking a complete stranger about their personal problems, you're essentially asking them to lower their status to a complete stranger. Most people are not gonna wanna do that. So what we're not trying to do is get the prospect to say, hey. Yeah. I have a personal problem with that. What we're trying to get them to admit is that, oh, I share a common problem that my peers also have. The way that we're gonna do this is through a framework called question stacking. Idea here is that we're putting context into the question before we ask it. And, one, that helps us put bumper guards up on the conversation, and it makes it very pointed so it's easier to answer. It's loaded with context, and it's low friction. Right? So it demonstrates competence through that context, and then I know what I'm talking about, and I talk to a lot of people like them. And it's low friction, low effort to answer because it's very pointed, yet open ended. I'm gonna give you a couple of examples of good versus bad, and what I really encourage you to do because this is in written form is go download the asset. All of the stuff I've talked about in this episode, you can download in the guide. Make sure to check it out in the description of the podcast. So a bad example, let's say I sell an HR platform. A bad example would be asking a question like this. What's your biggest challenge with your current HR platform? It doesn't have any context. It doesn't demonstrate any credibility, and it's very, very hard to answer because it's like, where do you start? You're likely going to encourage objections when you ask questions in that way. So instead, what we're gonna do is something like this. You know, I'm not sure if you're running into this, Dave, but a lot of HR leaders are sharing that they have a difficult time scaling and adapting to all the changes with work from home, return to office, budgets tightening, employee retention, etcetera. What places do you feel like you can't really systemize and and automate and manage as efficiently as you would like? Super pointed. I've talked about problems, specific things that people like them want to do. I'll give you one more example. So let's say I'm selling a solution that helps, prevent customers from calling into a contact center and speaking with a customer service rep by helping them answer their own questions in a faster way. Reduces cost to serve. So a really bad question to ask would be, hey. What factors are you noticing that are increasing wait times? There's no context. Super open ended. I don't demonstrate that I'm a trusted adviser. Instead, I can say, hey. You know, we're actually hearing from many digital leaders right now that staffing concerns are limiting human engagement, like, which actually increases wait times. So abandonment rates go up, cost to serve goes up. I'm I'm curious. How do you measure the impact of wait times on customer loyalty? Oh, we don't really have a way to do that. Exactly. That's why we called. Right? So question stacking, what you wanna have prepared is three or so questions that address common problems your prospect is likely having with a solution that they currently use. So that's part two, the hook. So so far, we've talked about how to nail the first sixty seconds, having some good problem based questions. You'll know that you've done a good job in part two when the prospect has shared a problem that they have. And they might even ask you at this point what it is that you'd do. Part three is saying goodbye. The ultimate power move, I learned this from, Bilab with Troy. Shared it with me in a webinar. I thought it was pretty cool. He's like, you need to be the one to say goodbye. That's how we level out the power dynamic. So if the call has gotten to this point, the meeting is essentially yours to lose. So your objective with this place is to secure the meeting. You're gonna quickly summarize what they said and then share a customer story, and then I'm gonna talk to you about how to schedule the meeting. That's gonna sound something like this. Hey. Great. So what I heard is that there's a good portion of your online customers who interact with a chatbot, and they're not able to get their questions answered. You're not sure how many, but it's bogging your agents down and driving up the cost to serve. That's exactly what I hear from other retailers like Nordstrom, who we've helped find out what those reasons why people are calling in, where they get stuck, and then prevent them from calling into the contact center. Do you have your calendar handy? I'm gonna go right into the close. Okay? If you know the prospect is a good fit, don't ask if they wanna meet. Be assumptive and roll right into scheduling. Hey. Do you have your calendar handy? The next step is meeting with my account executive, Tom, who can show you how we typically help with these challenges. What's your schedule looking like tomorrow in the afternoon, let's say 3PM? Lastly, what we wanna make sure to do is what I call a triple confirmation. This really tightens up how we end the call and make sure that the prospect has a very high likelihood of showing up. One is we're going to get them to accept the calendar invite on the call. Alright, Katie. So I have you down for 2PM, PT tomorrow. Can you do me a quick favor? Do you mind accepting the calendar invite that was just emailed to you? Sometimes these emails end up in the spam folder. Get them to accept the calendar invite on the call. Two, remind the prospect while you're talking. Re share the agenda. Hey. I'm really excited to keep the conversation going. Again, we'll talk about the challenges you mentioned with the calls coming into the contact center where your team's getting bogged down, and I'll share how Nordstrom and a few other companies are approaching the similar challenges. Three is confirmation. So I'm gonna let the prospect know that I'm gonna reach out to confirm the meeting. Last thing, I'm gonna send you a quick text, in email the day before your meeting. Is this the best number to send that text? Awesome. I sent you a text just now so that you have it. I also included my account executive. Would you mind responding to that when you get a chance so we know you're good to go? Awesome. So that's three parts. Okay? So, again, what I would encourage you to do, we went through a lot of text. All of this is in written form for you to go check out. Make sure to see the description, download the asset. You'll get the full cold calling guide for free. So what we talked about was how to first nail that first sixty seconds. Where most reps fail, we wanna use a permission based opener and a reverse pitch instead of an elevator pitch. The hook, we wanna make sure to engage the prospect with preset questions that we ask that are loaded with context. And then lastly, we wanna say goodbye and leverage that triple confirmation. So that's all I got for you. Go check out that asset. If you wanna connect with me, again, my name is Jason Bay. I run a company called Outbound Squad where we help both BDRs, SDRs, and account executives turn complete strangers into paying customers. So we help with outbound discovery, demos, multi threading negotiations, all of the above. Outboundsquad.com is the best place to, check us out for that. I appreciate you sticking around and, hanging on the podcast with me today. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out.
