## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Armand Frog. I'm here with my co host Nick Sigelski. And today, we have somebody who's prospecting on Instagram. It's Tara Horstmeyer, the director of partner success over at Gravy and a previous head of sales development over there too. Nick, why should people listen? I have botched social media prospecting so many times, and this episode gave me some clarity into why. So if you wanna get better at prospecting on social media, give this one a listen. Three, two, one. Follow me. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Tara. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top reactionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. I'm so excited about this. So not a lot of people do voice notes, so I'm gonna tell you how. So my three ways are actually the three g's of voice notes. Number one is going to be greeting. You don't need to say your name. They already see it. Start with the person's name. Hey, Arman. Hey, Nick, with energy and enthusiasm. Second, gratitude. You're gonna tell them, hey. This is why I am so excited to connect with you. You're gonna thank them for listening to accepting the connection, listening to the note, and then you're gonna tell them one thing that you are really grateful about that person and what they do. And then lastly, you're gonna get to the point. You're gonna be in, you're gonna be quick, and you're going to be gone. So end your note with saying, hey. Really excited to connect with you. Can't wait to read more of your content and learn more about you, and that's it. Very nice, Tara. What's the next tip? So number two is actually going to be what I like to call the you, and I'm not talking about the University of Miami. I'm gonna talk about you and not me, but you you always want to talk about your prospects. So when you're doing any kind of scripting, when you're doing emails, everything that you write, everything that you say, go back and edit yourself. Make sure you replace every I and we about me and my company, and you make it about you. It's a really simple tweak, but when you see I or when you say we, that should be a red flag to go back, change the sentence, change the structure, make it about the you as in the you and your prospect. I love it. Round us out. What's the last one? So the last one is actually my favorite. That is the handwritten note one zero one. You've just had a great conversation, a great call, and you wanna end with really wowing your prospect, wowing somebody who's in the conversation with you in the sales conversation. So you know what? You may not have their address, and that's okay. Get out your handwritten note. Write them a note. Include a great nugget, something that you really enjoyed about that person. Then take a picture of it. Shoot it to them over DM, over email, over text, whatever way that you can, and you will surprise and delight the heck out of people because they know you took the time to make it personal, and you didn't wait or ask for their address or anything like that. So in our prep doc here, I know you have a couple different pieces of your cold email, and one of those pieces is is talking about education. But I think we have the subject line, your preview text, your opening hook, your body copy, and then your CTA. So let's actually just go through these one by one. And so let's start with the subject line. What do we gotta do in the subject line to get people's attention and sort of rope them in in the first place? K. One of my favorites is you are awesome. So you just start with curiosity. And it sounds so simple, but let me tell you, if I get an email from Nick and it says, Tara, you're awesome. I'm like, That's gonna stand up to me. But you know what? It's gonna come across really cheesy if you don't start, tell me why. So that's where your preview texts come in. And it's like, hey, Tara. I just read this really cool article that you wrote, or I just saw that you posted this interesting thing. Or, hey, I know that you just got promoted to, you know, VP of x y z. That's amazing and here's why. And then you can say, here's why. Da, da, da. Because you're leading with curiosity. You're leading about me. And so now I've got a cool subject line that's about me. I've got a really cool preview text that shows me, okay, this isn't just a spam. It's not something that it actually really it's relevant to me. So now I'm gonna open it. So what I've done is I've written the email line, email subject to get me to the preview text. I read the preview text to get me to the first line of opening email. And so everything that you write has gotta lead you to the next line. So then in your opening of your email, as we talked about, you're going to just unpack a little more about why Nick is awesome, or why this should matter, and why should he care to keep reading. So that leads to your body copy of your education of, hey, what is it exactly that you do? Like, that's great, that I'm awesome, and that I that's great that I'm spending a few seconds reading this. But what is in it for me? And what specifically can you do that's different than maybe I've already have and do if it's looking to maybe switch platforms? Or if it's, hey, this is something brand new that maybe you haven't thought of or maybe that could reveal a pain point. And that's when you've educated them and then you leave with your CTA, which I am a big fan of I know we've talked about it a lot or as just salespeople of not asking for time, but of just inviting a conversation and, just asking a question that leads them to, hey. Let's just get a conversation going, and let's see if we can get a reply to see if they're even interested in what I've already said. Eric, can you give me an example of because I think I understand the the subject line and that sort of intro copy there, the preview text, but the hook to body piece. Can you maybe voice over and you can use Gravy as an example if you think that would be easier? What does it actually sound like? Like, what are you actually writing? So that's something that sounds very similar to, like, hey, Nick. You know, I know you work for this company, and I've said these right things that show me again that you know me. Well, you know what? I'm not sure if you know this, but you could potentially have a really big hole hole in the back of your business. And that's where we describe at that point what gravy does in light of how it could specifically save you. So if you have recurring revenue, did you know that you may actually be losing up to fifty, seventy five, 80% of a certain pocket of revenue due to people whose credit cards decline accidentally? Like, these are people who are saying, oh my gosh. I wanna cancel or I don't want this membership anymore, but it's an accident. They didn't even know. And you may not even know that they are out the door and not paying unless you're paying attention to those paying people. So I would eliminate that, again, in terms of you, not in terms of, like, gravy's number one and this is how we do it and this is the weeds of it. But I would just say, hey, you may not even know. This might hook you in of, like, oh, gosh, I may not even know this. I may have a problem that I don't know about. So that, again, hooks you into what is what is important to you while also saying this is actually what we do. Would you be interested in in learning more about how we do this? Would you be interested in, you know, following up? Or have have you even thought about this as being a problem? Something like that, and not saying, can we hop on a call tomorrow? And one of the things I think you do is you help new SDRs put together some of these emails. And can you talk about some of the common mistakes that you see new salespeople make and how that they could correct those? Oh, absolutely. So the biggest one is that they rely on, templates and not on their brains. So they new SDRs I mean, any SDRs, really. But I'll craft something or we'll put together just some guidelines and then one by one because you're like, oh gosh. I've got to send these out fast. I've got to do it. And so you're not taking each email or each person into account. You're trying to rush. Like, the number one mistake I see new SDRs make, especially in writing any kind of copy, is trying to rush through it and get to the end rather than taking the time to massage it so that it sounds like them. So if they do get on the phone or if they do have a conversation, it's not feeling like, oh, gosh. I just sent this templated response and now I'm actually having a conversation because you replied and I'm a real person. So just using the template as a template and not bringing yourself and your amazing, wonderful, sharp mind into it. And then questioning. That's the other thing too is, hey, maybe this template worked for three months, but now, hey. Now pandemic is over, let's say, and we're not refreshing our copy. Oh my gosh. Like, this is where I need new eyes and new SDRs to to start questioning. Like, hey. This isn't working anymore. We need to update our messaging or we need it to sound a different way because it's just not landing well. And if we think about how you're tying this into some of your other forms of comms, it sounds like you're doing a little bit of video, a little bit of LinkedIn, a little bit of email. Before we jump into those other channels, what I would love to understand is what is your strategy around tailoring? And what I mean by that is are you doing LinkedIn videos hand handwritten notes for every single person in the world? Are you tearing out your a's, b's, and c's? How How do you do this in a way that scales and is also efficient for your time without just sending out all the templated garbage? Yeah. Great question. So that, honestly, is where the individual reps come into play. Like, this is one of those things that it's like, absolutely. Do we have a sequence? Do we have steps? Yes. There is that. But one of the great things about Gravy is that we have really allowed our reps to figure this out as they go and to make sure it's humanized. Like, yes. First touches, especially when we started on Instagram, is going to be a text DM just to even get their their interest going. But then when you bump, it's like, okay. We're gonna do a voice note. But what it's really gonna come down to is each rep knowing where they are and who they're reaching out to and then making those pivots as they go. Like, hey. I just had a great connection with that person. He just connected, and he just commented on something I posted. So I'm gonna follow-up with the video. So, it's not just knowing, hey, when to stick to the steps, but also when to go your own way and make sure that you are connecting human to human and pivoting when it makes sense to be over personalized or over, not over processed, but making sure that the process is serving you as an SDR and as a person. Tara, I really gotta dig into this social media prospecting things. We were talking about it on the prep side of this call, and I've tried prospecting on Instagram and Twitter before, and it just was a disaster for me. And I think that was more about Nick than the actual process. But you've been doing this for a while. Can you talk about the different ways you've prospected on social media and some of the best and worst practices that you've gleaned from that? Oh my gosh. Yes. So little round of fact, miss. We don't know. Grady started not on LinkedIn. We we've been around for a hot minute. I know most people think, oh gosh. We just kinda came into the scene, you know, six months this year ago. But, we've we've been living and hanging out on Instagram. So that is where you always say, hey. You've gotta go play in traffic where your people are. Our people really were on Instagram. That was our main ICP when we started. We work with a lot of course creators, a lot of personal brands. And where all those people were, Instagram. So when I'm reaching out to somebody, I'm like, this sucks sending out just, you know, cut and paste stuff. Like, I don't wanna receive that. So I kind of have the benefit of being the first, you know, and so you just kinda do it. But starting on Instagram, but also just starting to communicate as a normal human. Like, hey. I just thought or I sent that first message. Alright. Tara's on the other side of it. If I'm receiving a message, what kind of message would I actually want to open and view and read and learn more about? And so it was more in how I approach everything as a human, and I'll unpack what that means. But really what it means is, again, talking about the other person first and seeing what was amazing about them so that they know, hey. I spent some time getting to know them. I've been on their profile. On Instagram, they don't have phone numbers. They don't have a lot. All you've got is the DM, and they can ignore the heck out of that. But for some reason, people started responding because I was just a human connecting and talking to them, like, hey, Nick. You've got this course. This is amazing. This is how I really think it could impact people. Did you know? There could be a problem going on. But you know what? You can go to my page. You can go to my profile. You can see me as me. And I'm talking to you just like I would write my own post on Instagram. I'm being a human and I'm signing off, you know, Tara, smiley face, and being I mean, just being me. Not everybody's like that. But the point is is even seeing our SDRs come in is that, encouraging every single person, again, to message just like they would another human being. Sure. It's professional, but I also think business is personal. So the area that I really struggled with on social media prospecting like, I felt like I was okay with the actual copy of the messages. It was actually finding the accounts that I wanted to to prospect and and then the contacts within those accounts. So how did you do that? Well, ours, we just we gotta do the hack of, like, you just you find your main you find your main influencers, and then you just start following people like them. So you can click down on the Instagram button. It says similar accounts. And so you just go down the rabbit hole of following similar accounts, getting to know these people. I would also follow them, like, hello, engage in their content, be a human. And so after a while, probably the name recognition or seeing me kinda come up, helps some of that. But, that's what you do. You just go follow similar people like that. And then just like anything else, you find your big, you know, influencers, people who are who have a really big following. People who who taught course creators actually create courses, and then you would see, you know, work with them on, okay, who's on their account and just finding that way. So you've got all of these different channels. This is probably the most multichannel we've ever heard of. We've got Instagram. We have LinkedIn voice note. We have video. We have email. You probably have some calls mixed mixed in. And so could you give us a sense if you look at the lifetime of your cadence or the lifetime of your sequence, when are each of these things being weaved in? Is it just like, boom, like, everything on the first touches, like, LinkedIn, Instagram, email, cold call, blast, blast, blast, and then silence? Or how do you how do you do this over thirty days so that you're not just, like, going crazy? When I was doing it, it was mainly Instagram. So it start out with a text DM and then you'd wait, you know, and see. And I would say I mean, I don't have the hard date, but, gosh, at least 80% of the calls that we booked were from that first DM. So we would start there, and then we go into email and follow-up with that and try honestly, keep pushing them back to Instagram. And, so after that email, so we'd have a DM, then we'd have an email, then we'd come back to Instagram and follow-up with a voice note. So, again, doing something different. Then we'd wait, come back to email, follow-up with the second email. And so really try to hit those within about four or five days so that they've gotten four touches. Then you'd come back to Instagram and do a video. Do a really fun video. You can add, like, you know, text to your video. You just make it fun. The whole thing is like, this should be fun. It's not fun to get a no. But when you're having a really good time, again, you wanna keep pointing them back to your main platform. And in our case, it was Instagram even if they would reply over email. And then we'd come back and we most likely finish out an email. Because if they have not replied by your third Instagram touch, then most likely either they weren't seeing it, you can also see if it's seen, or they're just not interested after that much person, you know, personal touches that we would just stick to email and see if we can just educating them and and weaving things over email and a little bit, it just wouldn't take as much time. Let's say we're on Instagram or let's say I'm just even recording a LinkedIn video or an Instagram video. There are a lot of things that people screw up. For example, I got a ring light here and, like, my my lighting is right. But a lot of people are, like, in the darkness or they're disheveled and they look like they just woke woke up out of bed. And so from a an aesthetic standpoint and from a setup standpoint, are are there any best practices you have around making your Instagram and video look like you're not a weird rando? Don't try to be perfect. Don't try to be a runway model. Like, don't try to live the Instagram culture because you know what? That fake crap has gotta go. Gone. Fine. So be yourself. But, yeah, you can definitely be like, I wanna be the best version of myself. So especially when it comes to like, Hey, I wanna connect to somebody. I wanna put my best foot forward. Because that's what we all want. We want that. You want you to shine through whatever that is. So you're right. There are certain not to's as in Yeah. Don't be in a dark corner. Make sure that you're facing light or have a light, something like that. Something that lights you up. Also, be aware of your surroundings. Like, I always have to look around like, gosh, you know, is there trash over there? Is there garbage? That and it's not like, okay, this is terrible. You're a horrible person, but it's just distracting, you know? So think about your surroundings where you are. You wanna have great light because you want the focus to be on you, not on the things that are around you. And what you're saying is ultimately what you're saying is you hope to pull your prospect into, hey. I care about you. Make eye contact. Smile for the love of all things. Don't look so serious. Have fun. You know? Gosh. What else? Be slow when you talk. Like, we tend to I tend to get really excited. And it's like, oh, gosh. I don't even know what I'm saying. So listen to yourself. Practice. Watch a video back. That's kind of the joy of video is that you're gonna be your worst critic, and so you're probably gonna cringe. But that's the best time to do it is to look back and be like, hey. Am I engaging? Did I bring energy? Did I sound excited? Do I sound believable? Do I sound like a robot? Most people don't try to sound like a robot. But if you're not confident in what you're saying, you're just gonna come across as that as, like, I'm memorizing this pitch and I'm just trying to deliver it. Like, I'm, like, a third grader on stage, you know, it's spelling it or something. And it just sounds inauthentic. So practice, try it. But, yes, visually look around, be yourself, get great lighting, and then don't try to over perfect anything because then it feels like a candid studio. You know? It doesn't sound like, hey. I'm just trying to connect and be normal. But I I wanna keep going back to social media because you also do a really good job, like, engaging and sort of almost you almost build, like, a community on LinkedIn I've seen, Tara. You have a ton ton of engagement, and some of them are your prospects and customers who are, like, writing on your your LinkedIn posts. And so can you talk about your general approach to LinkedIn and how you've used that to find new business? The biggest thing that you can do, again, is just like you were saying, it's be engaging. It's actually care about other people. Write about things that your people will care about and write about them as you. And so that way, when you do take things offline, when you do have those conversations, when you do send that, hey. Thanks for popping on, you know, my content or thanks for that really cool comment. Tell me more about you. What's going on? How's your life? I saw your thing. Talk to them normal. You're not trying to pitch anybody anything. You're just trying to be normal. And then if it comes up and they have a need, they're more aware of not just who you are, but they've really they know what you do now. And the biggest thing are the things that we all care about. Know, like, and trust. I mean, my gosh. Everybody wants to skip right to trust and go, but I'm like, gosh, you've got to spend some time doing the know and the like. And this isn't doing it, like, okay, I'm checking off boxes, but really, when people are genuine, you are likable. You don't have to be genuinely me. You have to be genuinely you. Nick has to show up, you know, Armand has to show up on LinkedIn as Nick and Armand as like, okay, this is who we are. And so when we go offline and we have a conversation, again, that's a door opener. It's not saying, okay. We're gonna have a call or we're gonna book a meeting or demo, but that door is gonna be open. And maybe it's a timing thing. Maybe it's a I need a different person thing. But now we've already hit no and like, and so we can move to trust much faster. It's amazing that this happens especially with junior reps who are just starting their careers, and they think all of their buyers are these super uptight people who have zero personality whatsoever. And so they have their messages starting with dear sir or madam practically, or it's like thirty MPC is the leading provider of this or I saw that your LinkedIn said that you do this without any conjunctions at all. And so always recommend, you gotta read your stuff out loud before you send it out. Read it out loud and put the tone in it. And if it feels robotic, you probably shouldn't send it out. In other words, it should feel like a text message, especially on Instagram. It's probably a great way to practice is just like looking at Instagram DMs and seeing how normal people talk and then translating that to some of the other channels that you have in sales life. For the love, yes. Yeah. And I do see a shift. Like, this isn't, oh, gosh. Everybody's, you know, doing it terrible at all. Like, I really think people are are starting to get it. I think the young crew, especially the SDRs that we had, you know, the Millies, like, they just come in and they don't know any different, which is great because you're not having to untrain people. You're just having to reinforce what they do and how they're doing it. So bringing in the personality, remembering that everybody you're prospecting, yes, is still a human and they wanna be treated as such. Doesn't mean you start, hey, bro. You know? Probably not. But it also can mean, hey. Hey, Nick. Hey, Armand. How's it going? You know? Like and when you do it as a person who actually sounds like they care, not, hey. I'm saying this just to get to what I really wanna say. We've all been in conversations with those people at a party or at a dinner when it's like they're going through the formalities, but, you know, they're just really rushing to get where they want, like, where they wanna go. Same thing is true with our prospects. Like, they're smart. They're great people, but they also know when you're just trying to get where you wanna go instead of saying, hey. I'm here to help get you where you wanna go. Yeah. I'm totally guilty of, as a new SDR, sending an email that said, dear mister Farouk as, as the opening line. So that's my fault. Tara, this has been an awesome episode, and we gotta move to our final question now. So the final question is gonna be this. We've talked about a ton of really, really good habits for salespeople to start implementing into their sales life, but we gotta talk about a bad habit. So the last question is gonna be, what is one bad habit that sales reps need to stop doing, throw in the trash because it's wrong and it's hurting them? Sounding and presenting yourself like a templated robot. So literally, if I can take your name off of the email and sub it out with any other name, you're doing it wrong. You know? And so that doesn't mean, okay, if it's Nick or her mind, I don't know them, so I I might confuse their personality. It's not that. It's that literally it can be, company x y z is sending this out. I don't care. If if I'm signing up for an automated newsletter, great. I wanna get that. I wanna get the HubSpot roundup. When I am, number one, not signing up for anything, and number two, you're reaching out to me to try to have a conversation with me, I want to know this is Nick. This is what he's about. This is who he is. This is why I should care. Not this is company x y z reaching out to me trying to take my money. Because and still, until we, you know, drop the robotic approach, start to bring in the human, we are just gonna end up in the side of automation, which is so easy to delete and to move out, but it's really much harder to delete a person when you see the person in there. I love it. Tara, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? Just love to hang out with people on, LinkedIn. So follow me, find me on LinkedIn if there are any SDRs who need some extra help, encouragement, managers. I've been there, done it all, and I just love encouraging, coaching and, helping new SDRs and some veterans get where they need to go. Beautiful. Tara, thank you so much for coming on the show. Everybody stick around. We got a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Your top four takeaways from the episode with Tara Horstmeyer include number one, after a meeting with prospect, you're gonna write a handwritten note. But here's the deal. You don't have their address? That's okay. Snap a photo of it, send it to them afterwards. Works the same. Number two, your Instagram sequence, which can also be similar to your LinkedIn sequence. So no excuses here. You're gonna start with a text DM. That could be a LinkedIn DM. From there, you're gonna do an an email follow-up. You're always driving them back to the main social platform. From there, you're gonna do a voice note, wait a couple more days, then do a video. And so you're not blasting with everything upfront. You're mixing it all in. Number three, do not be the weirdo with the weird lighting. Your setup should include the following when you're doing videos. Include proper lighting. Get all the garbage out of your background. Remove your trash can. Have a nice fiddle leaf tree like Nick does. Smile. Don't be the creep who doesn't smile. Slow it down when you talk. Don't be talking faster than your brain can keep up with. And then lastly, have a good time with your prospecting. Read your notes out loud. If they don't sound like human notes, you should probably be rewriting them. Don't be afraid to show some personality. Alrighty, Nick. What's next? Well, contrary to popular belief, Armand and I do exist on Instagram. We don't really post anything about sales, but if you wanna see a video of me working out at the park and Arman's protein shake that he had yesterday, we're open to a follow. So check us out there. And if you don't want to do that, that's okay too. But we'll see you all next week on thirty minutes of Presidents Club. Thanks for listening.
