## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Froeck, and I'm here with my cohost, Mark Casaglow. And today, we have a 30 MPC fan favorite. He was a phenomenal enterprise leader over at Clari, and now he's running teams over at Tropic. It's the one and only Anthony Cesario on the leadership edition. Mark, why should people listen? Tony c brought it today. And let me just say, there's some topics that sales leaders need to listen to, and there's some that are fun to listen to. This could be both if you really love territory construction because we get into the weeds, and I think it is a extremely important subject. I think that most revenue leaders need to be really versed in understanding of it. So I think that we got into the deep details today of how to construct a territory to make sure that that elite talent feels like you're giving them a chance to make money. That's right. And I'm glad this isn't a webinar because I don't get to listen to you all complain in the chat about your territories. And a three, two, one. Let's ride. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive goes to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kind of where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Anthony. Welcome back to the show. This time on the leadership edition, we start every show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. So first, how do you hire elite teams of talent? Like, genuinely, people that are the very best in the world at what they do. How do you build a team that tend to end comprise of those types of people? And the way you do it is by focusing on the experiences that these people wanna have next in their career. So there's three things you have to do to do that right. First, you need to make that your currency as a leader. Your ability to deliver on these experiences should be how you rate yourself as a leader. Two, you need to focus on the experiences that each individual member on that team wanna have. And then you need to think deeply about, How do I actually bring them to life? And then three, you actually need to give them these opportunities now. Even if that experience is the next step, next chapter of their career, you need to find ways to give them at least parts of those experiences that are currentable. And So let me give you an example. You know, when I was building the enterprise team at Clari, enterprise roles are really hard because there are people that with enterprise sales rep, it's maybe the best job on the planet. Maybe they don't ever wanna do anything else for the rest of their lives. And so on my team, you know, I had one incredible team member named Michael Kenny, who wanted to be a leader. And we discussed that from the very get go, from the interview process. And so what did we do? We gave Michael opportunities to become a leader from the day that he walked in the door, he joined my leadership meetings, he helped build process to scale across the company. So the moment that a leadership opportunity opened up, it was a no brainer to put Michael into it, because he was already doing it. He already had his experiences. Versus I had another member on the same team who just loved to travel the world and have the incredible experiences in life, and he wanted to maximize his W-two. So we had to create a very different career plan for him, for how do you like literally create the greatest W-two in Clari history, if we were able to do. Boom. What's number two? Number two. Right now, there's a lot of pressure on getting more output out of less resources, with the focus on efficient growth as a company. So how how do you drive up ASP? How do you drive up conversion rates with less resources? You need to take what I call a focused capacity approach. So what do I mean by that? One, we need to make sure that we're spending the very limited resources we have as a team on the motions that the go to market strategy that we built dictates are most important. So that starts with taking names very data driven approach to building out your ICP primary, ICP secondary, ICP tertiary, focusing on what are the accounts we want people spending time in. And then two, you need to build equitable territories across those books, across those dimensions. And so we're making sure that every territory we have has an equal chance to go deliver as much revenue as possible. That's also a key factor, number one, by the way, if you wanna lead talent, especially sales talent, if Mark has a great book and Arman has a crappy book, Arman's gonna leave. And so if you want world class talent, you wanna make sure everyone has a fair shot to hit their number as well. Boom. Well, thank you for giving all reps a fair shot, and I will give you a fair shot to have an equitably great third tactic. What's number three? Yeah. Sure. As reps, you know, you give a lot of presentations, you run a lot of meetings. As leaders, right, you're also giving a lot of presentations that are important as well, both internally and externally. I think in both cases, right, when you're training your team on how to deliver world class memorable presentations, and when you're giving your own, whether that's your executive staff or the board or whoever or your own team, in order to deliver presentations that people are actually gonna remember, you should focus on what I call a moments that matter strategy to presentations. So what does that mean? First, you have to define the moments that matter in the meeting. What I mean by that is, what do you want the most important people in that meeting to walk away saying, thinking, feeling, saying, doing at the end of that meeting? And so second, we also want to think about the resources that you have to create those moments. And then third, we want to plan the entire meeting around those moments. We wanna make sure that the success of each component of the meeting is delivering on one of those moments. And then lastly, we just wanna make sure that we have the opportunity to actually create these experiences. And so you can do that with an approach I call pattern interrupt. Alright, dude. I'm very interested in these moments of that matter. But you said something that 99% of reps would disagree with, equal books. There ain't a rep on the planet that says my book doesn't suck. So take me through it, man. Like, if you're creating equitable books, how you selling the team on it? I would first say in order to create a strategy where you want equitable books, you have to really believe that you have elite talent across that entire team or across consistent talent, I would say, across the team. Because the question I get a lot when I brought this strategy up is, well, don't you want your best accounts with your best reps? And my answer is no. All your reps should be your best reps. If you're truly hiring a world class team, you want everyone to have a fair shot because they're all elite talent, and they all can drive revenue for the company. And so first, I would just say that's a precursor for this strategy to even work. But assuming you've done a really good job hiring an elite team, I think the way you bring the reps on this journey is you have to be really transparent and detailed showing them how we created these books in an equitable way, taking them through the process step by step. Because every rep thinks in the sixty seconds that you just presented this strategy to them, that they figured out in their head with more precision that they know a better way to do it than you. So when you show them that we've been working on this strategy for three months and a lot of people that are equally as smart as these reps, and you take them through the process, it usually helps them understand how much thought, you know, has gone into this and and why they should feel good about the books. What do you base quality on? Size of prize, number of accounts, equitable geos? Like, what does equitable mean in Anthony's world? You know, it's different. I'm learning, you know, what that means in my new company right now, Tropic, as we, you know, design books for the year. I could tell you what it meant when I was building out enterprise at Clari. When I got to Clari, our enterprise books were built on geos, right? So there was like six Silicon Valley territories and four New York territories and what have you. And if your ICP is fairly industry focused, which ours was at Clarus, very tech focused initially, the tech hubs for us, anyone who had one of those territories was obviously going to have a much better chance to hit their number than someone who had the Midwest or what have you. And so the first thing we did was, one, define, you know, what are the factors that would make a book equitable? So one of those was industry, for sure. Nowadays, there's so much intense signal and things like that, that you can get way more data driven for how you want to decide what an equitable book would look like. Right? So that could be intense signals. That could be typographic data or things like that. And so once you've decided on those factors, that's usually one part of the matrix. The other one that we use at Clari was we built a concept of addressable ARR at the account level. So we were able to say, based off of the types of users that we would be selling to, We use LinkedIn sales insights data to model an adjustable ARR by account using a standard PUPY and the number of users that we think are in that account. And then we would build applicable books on that. So how many million dollar plus ARR accounts, 500 ks plus ARR accounts, all of that goes into day build. So we would say everyone has the equal number of not only ICP like accounts, but also the equal number of accounts by adjustable ARR bound. And we took the reps through that. And then as the like strategy to follow that, we would tell them, where do we want you to focus your capacity within those books? And so like for instance, our average time to close in the 100 ks to $2.50 ks bucket was like two zero six days in enterprise. The average time to close in the 500 ks to a million dollar bucket was two forty days. And so showing the reps that like, Hey, you can close a 500 ks deal just as fast as you can close a 100 ks deal, you might as well get some 500 ks deals in your pipeline. That was one of the things that helped us drive ASPs from, like, around a 100 k to over 400 k in a couple years. That's insane results. I mean, to grow the ASP that fast. Listen. I don't know, Armand, if you're down, but, like, this is like a fascinating topic to revenue leaders if you ask me. I think that everybody's trying to figure out how to create books that motivate reps, give everybody an equal chance to participate, line up with the comp expectations, and then you can give the least amount of accounts to somebody and get the most amount of revenue out of them. So I'd be interested, Anthony, to figure out, like so size a prize. Like, I think you called it what did you call it? Addressable ARR. Addressable ARR. So this concept basically is you add up the number of seats or usage looks or, you know, you estimate basically how much if you did a complete sell of the account, how much that account will be worth. Right? You add up all the total size of prizes in your account that gives you how much revenue that that territory should generate. And for size of prize equality, you're looking for all of your reps to be within 10 or 15% of each other in terms of size of prize. That takes care of one thing. But this other one that you said is super interesting, which is how fast does stuff close, and then how do I tier? So did y'all tier out accounts for reps and name the tier one, tier two, and tier three accounts, or was that an exercise that your reps did and then you took that data in? Both. One of the concepts that I really believe in, you know, as a revenue leader is you wanna make the reps CEO of their territories. And so the approach that I would take was I would give them the data on their business and show them, Hey, here's the segments within your business, right? 500 ks plus, million dollar plus, 100 ks plus, 50 ks plus, whatever. Here were the win rates in each of those segments last year. Here were the ASPs in each of those segments last year. Here were the average time to close in those, right? And then we give them the book and say, here's your territory. Here's how many accounts you have in these. I'm not gonna tell you how to hit your revenue number, but hopefully this data is helpful for you to focus your calories on the right parts of the business. And so we would make recommendations saying like, hey, you should focus here. Now that is on, like, the size within the accounts. Right? Like, as I mentioned earlier, on the tiering of, like, the actual accounts we want them focused on, that was a little different. We would say, we do want you to prospect through your first focus accounts first. Like, touch every first focus account before you move on to your next focus and your last focus. And that focus category is an organic concept. As they're touching these accounts, they might say, oh, that's where I could kinda do it on a three year contract. That's the last focus account now. So we would keep that organic throughout the year, but we did wanna make sure they were not selling to the Philadelphia Phillies and, you know, when we're, like, a IS and P tech focused company or something. And so both. Yeah. We would give them the data around the tiering, and then we would ask them to, you know, build their own strategy leveraging that data. But I'm a Philly fan. I want him to be a customer. Can I go talk to him, please, Anthony? Me too. Let's go. I mean, you're, like, a bar to get something to sell to Philly's. So let's go back a little bit, Anthony, and I wanna talk before it gets into a rep's hands. There were really two ingredients in Anthony's magic meatloaf. Number one is relation to ICP industry. Are they tech or not? Right? And then the second is the size of the prize. And so that's a pretty easy, simple to understand way to rank a territory. Right? Everyone gets this many tech companies, and then this is the distribution of size across those 10 tech companies that we're giving you. Right? I've seen other territory models that have, like, 17 scoring methodologies and 45 degrees into the meatloaf so that if they reached out to you in the past, it's one point. But if they reached out and there was a closed loss opportunity due to product, it's negative two points, and it gets super, super overwhelming and complex. How do you strike the balance between the fact that you probably missed some criteria, for example, no previous closed loss opportunities on the account. But at the same time, it's really nice and simple, what you've built. I don't think it's a straightforward answer. It really depends on the size of your SAM as a company. SAM, I mean serviceable, addressable market. People love to talk about their TAM, which is, like, everything in the universe that they theoretically could sell to. But then there's, like, the reality of, like, what is your SAM that you could actually go service right now? So I think you have to be really thoughtful about like, what that actually is. Like, who can we actually go sell to? And look, if you have the luxury that a lot of companies don't have of having a really big Sam, this becomes, to your point, you could go over index on all the factors, right, when when there's a million different companies you can go sell to. I think either way, what's important is, like, back to my point around focus capacity, focus capacity starts with the go to market strategy that you built on the year. So how how do we get the reps doing the things that we said when we sat down in a room and decided over three months, like, what we need to do this year? How do we get them to do those things? And, like, so for instance, you know, I was brought into Clari to scale the enterprise team, and my charter was we wanted to go further upmarket, and we wanted to increase ASPs so we could cut down CAC payback and all that fun stuff. And so when the charter was ASPs going higher, then that made it really easy for me to say, Okay, we're gonna segment this by addressable ARR, and we're gonna focus the capacity of the team on doing deals and higher ARR bands, right? That was just part of our strategy that year. When I was building industries at Clari, it was completely different. We were going in industries that we had never sold to successfully in the past. So it was a very different charter at that point. Now, the focus was on questions like, what is the technology that they buy before they buy us? And so we were looking at technographic data, right? Like, what was the tech stack in these industries that they already owned for customers that we had? And you saw things like, Oh, they purchased some MarTech, you know, like Marchetto or something, and maybe they purchased Seismic or Highspot or something. And so, all of a sudden, the technographic data became a really important driver in that go to market strategy because we wanted to make sure we weren't wasting sales cycles in companies that weren't actually gonna buy us at the end of them. And so I I don't think there's an easy answer. I think you have to design your go to market strategy and then figure out what are we trying to focus the capacity of the team to do, and then what you know, how do we segment territories based on that? I got a question for you, Anthony. There were times at Outreach where we got really cute, and we spent a lot of time getting these books and trying to make everybody happy. And then there were times where we're just kinda like, we don't got time for this. Let's, like, get this thing out easy peasy. Quick question. In each of those scenarios, how much do you think rep complaints varied in the two scenarios? The answer is zero. Everybody still complained no matter how much time. So you helped me. Like, where's the mark where, hey. We're putting too much effort y'all because it's just nothing's gonna happen if we keep thinking about this forever. It's not gonna be perfect. Everybody's still gonna be happy. You know? The worst rep say they don't have enough accounts, and that's what most reps say. The best reps say, I need less accounts. And so how are you determining the level of work and how much time you put into all this stuff? Yeah. I mean, I you had the benefit of being at Outreach through multiple phases of growth. I think in the early days, as my CEO Dave now talks about, like, you're kind of in pirate ship mode. As you grow up, you go into aircraft carrier mode, as he calls it. And so I think being really self aware of where you're at in your growth stage as a company and, like, again, you only have so many calories to spend. And the earlier you are, the less calories you actually have. And so I don't think there's a consistent answer for everyone, like, on how do you know when you know, how much time to spend on this. I think, for me, like the driver behind designing territories in the way that we're talking about is running a predictable revenue machine. You know, we're back to the days where money isn't free. Like if you're a startup right now, venture capital isn't just pouring in from the waterfalls around the canyon. So like, if you're gonna run an efficient business, you have to run a predictable revenue machine right now. And I really think that starts with trying to be as thoughtful and intentional as possible with how you're building territories. So I think you need to like put a lot of thought into this on front, no matter what you're doing. But depending on the size of your SAM and things like that, like that will probably dictate how much energy you really need to put into this. The smaller your SAM, the more calories you probably have to put into making sure, like, people are actually touching the right accounts. Yeah. I think it's spot on where in the early stages, when everyone's getting 500 account plus books, it's like, guys, like, stop arguing over who gets their seventeenth portion of gravy on your plate. There's gonna be a day when this is, like, 15 accounts. So, like, shove it and go eat while you can get fat today. Alright? So I totally agree, especially in the early stages. But when you're dividing 40 accounts across four reps, like, you don't wanna screw that up. And so I hear you there. I have a question on this one, which is, a couple tactical ones, actually. The first is, oftentimes, when you're cutting books, very rarely is someone just getting a brand new book where they lost all of their previous accounts and they're getting all new accounts. There is usually the concept of holdovers or maybe you lose some accounts, you gain some new ones. What are some best practices around holdovers? Specifically, how many new accounts will a rep typically get, and how many accounts will reps have to give away, and are there any parameters around giving those things away? Well, one, I'll give a plug to, you know, my former company Clari. With the visibility that I got into the activity actually going into those accounts, Clarity of Me within the product. Now I'm a Clarity customer, you know, at Tropic. So it was really helpful right now also. But having visibility into like how much time people actually spent in those accounts really helps because you'll have every rep say, I prospected the you know what added that account for the last six months. And then I'll go look at it, and I'm like, You sent them eight emails over a six month period. Like, first off, if that's what you think prospecting, they should have an account, is like, We should talk. So that like taking a data driven approach with all the activity data that's out there now, whether it's in Clari or anywhere else, really helps to like get a starting place where you like, we would literally build a bucket and say, there is no way to dispute with us to hide these accounts to change hands, period. Like, you don't get an argument if you haven't been actually working these accounts in the way that we think you should. So that you'd be surprised how big that bucket is. You know, then you want to just take a thoughtful approach. Like, you always want what's best for the account, right? So if I get too worried I get worried about, like, super rigid hold policies, right, where it's like you get five holds or whatever that looks like. If we are super engaged in 12 accounts in that rep's territory, and we're about to rip seven of them away because we have a five account hold policy, like, I I think it's important to have a policy, but be flexible on optimizing first for the customer, second for the rep, third for the company is kind of how I think about it. And usually, you know, having some guidelines like that, you can kind of work through the whole stuff. But my takeaway that's, like, probably the more moment is use activity data to pressure test, you know, what's actually happening in those accounts, who they actually have relationships with. And you'd be surprised how many are pretty easy to just kinda rip out and put in other people's hands. Yeah. I mean, what we did at Pave is we were growing really quickly, and so books were constantly getting cut. And so if we knew someone was gonna get hired in three months, we would actually cut some extra books just so that we didn't have to do this rip and replace constantly. What we did is we said, okay. We're gonna look at all your active open ops. And then from there, there's sort of what's left. And we did have a five to 10 holdover policy. But then the reps that are really, really good could still go through an approval process to get more, but they needed to prove that they had active contact. They were working these deals, all of this stuff. So I never wanna penalize a rep for doing a good job of working their territory. But at the same time, I don't want everyone just hoarding everything and going through a million different approvals. So I think it's important to have a policy to your point, but then allow for flex in that to reward the top reps who actually work in their territory. And to be fair, honestly, a lot of the best reps you guys ever play, like, Cards Against Humanity or or anything like that? You know when you have a bunch of, like, crappy cards in your hand and, like, you just replace one per hand? And so I feel like the best reps look at their territory like that. Even though they're working some of these accounts, they might know like better than they wanna get rid of them because they've been working on it. They're like, They're never gonna buy. And so I think a lot of the better reps were actually excited to be able to swap it out and take a shot of accounts that other people, like, may have been having a harder time with and, like, get fresh eyes on these accounts. So yeah. But I agree with you. I'm on. The, four letter word for ops and revenue leadership is holdover op. I bet they close at a 2% rate max. Everybody wants them. I've been working this op. I should close it. You get the holdover. Never closes. Usually goes silent within two days. So I don't know, man. I think everybody gets, you know, their underwear in a wad too much trying to think about this stuff. Here's the thing. The next meeting is your best meeting. So, like, just take the next meeting and let's roll. You know what I'm saying? Go get that next meeting. You know what people don't realize about holdover ops? There's another name for them. They're called slipped ops. Well, yes. It's rarely an op that, like, you know, it's closed date started in the new fiscal year that you're in or whatever. It slipped into that year. And so it's funny. I've done a lot of slip deal analysis. Like, a lot of what we helped companies with at Clari was, like, getting a handle on slips. And same thing, like, it's funny when companies have great linearity in the first, like, three weeks of a quarter, like, you just slipped a bunch of deals out of the last quarter, like, be better at closing. But anyway, yeah, with you, Mark, a lot of times those deals that are holdover ops, they get a lot of calories at, like, the prime part of the quarter, and then they don't end up closing. Mark, would you just end up ripping them? Because we had about a forty five day deal cycle at Pave. So I would say, like, ninety days, they move no matter what. But would you just rip them right away? No. I gave a period, and then I'd rip them. Yep. Yeah. Relatives are late stage only. Like, had to be like s three plus where there was a lot of our last call together guys, but we had really clear stage definitions around, you know, there had to be a path to securing budget and things like that. We have to get it to stage three. So, yeah, we used to be s two plus. We moved it to s three plus, you know, after watching a lot of these things just not closed. Well, we just finished the most nerdy twenty five minutes of thirty minutes to president's club leadership edition that's ever existed. So I will do wanna, before we go, just talk about one other thing that I think that you do that's really, really interesting, which is moments that matter. And so you've kind of created this concept that says, in most meetings, there is one, two, or three things things that you need to identify and just absolutely nail as a seller, and you need to build a whole meeting around that. What I'm interested in is the seller level that you decide that. Is that, like, the sales leadership level? Are these, like, known areas inside the sales process? Like, how do you come up with a moment that matters? Is it just like a rep looking at their next meeting and making some calls? Well, I think you can be both. Since we're talking to a bunch of leaders here, I'll give you where the concept came from, and then I'm gonna answer your question. Because I think this is a really important thing for leaders to think about. I learned moments that matter. I used to sell HR technology, and I was selling to Cisco, or my team was selling to Cisco at least. And Cisco has a really innovative HR philosophy. They came up with this concept called moments that matter, where they thought through: What are the points in an employee's career that when they leave our company, they're going to remember, they're going to talk about? And it's things like the very first conversation you have at the company. It's your first day on the job. It's when you go on maternity leave or paternity leave. It's when you leave the company, when you head to the company. And so they sat down as a company and said, What are the moments that matter across the employee life cycle that we wanna be really, really intentional about creating experiences around? And then they literally would have like a committee where if they were making any decisions that impacted that moment, it literally had to go through a committee to say like, Okay, how do we want to design this? So like for instance, if you were leaving Cisco, they called it like my legacy. Like, what is the legacy that we wanted to create for that employee? And they they'll do things like bring people back on interview panels who left the company for that job and, like, you walk up to things like that. That always stuck with me. Yeah. Like, the intentionality that they took around these really important moments, I've taken that or have embedded in a lot of different ways how I lead. And so I just wanted to give you that, just like, as you think about as a leader, the, what are the moments that matter just that you wanna have with your team as a leader? Something to think about. As it relates to your question, I think, you know, as a team, there's probably some moments that, like, we wanna make sure that we're delivering on in a world class way every single time we sell. And so you can probably define that as a group and say, hey. What do we wanna be knowing as, like, anytime someone sees that, like, that they they're gonna go talk about it. For this, like, the concept I was talking about here more is actually meeting specific. Every meeting is different for, like, what you want to happen at the end of that meeting. Like, the outcome that maybe you're driving the sales meeting is I want the head of procurement to go tell her CFO, you need to come look at this software. And so the moment that matters might be, Hey, I gotta get this in front of Alyssa, my CFO. That's the moment that matters. And Arman, you might remember this. We talked about this back in the day on The Rep podcast. We'll literally put those moments that matter on a slide at the beginning of the meeting, where in quotations it says, Hey, if I do my job well, you're going to walk out of here saying, Alyssa really needs to see this. You're also going to say, Jeez, I really like spending time with Anthony. When you go do that at the beginning of the meeting, it's forcing their brain to think differently about, like, what's about to come in that presentation. And now they're actually listening and engaged, and you can actually create those moments much easier than if they're, like, waiting for the demo to kick off, if that makes sense. Alright, Anthony. Well, we talked about a lot of good habits here, but, unfortunately, we are not fifty two minutes to president's club, and so we do have to move to the final question. And the final question is, we talked about the good habits, but what is one bad habit that you believe every sales leader should break today to make all revenue teams out there a little bit better? I think probably the habit that happens most often, certainly for first time leaders, it's knowing when to turn the knob from coach to advisor, right? Like my CEO at Clari, Andy Byrne, he would say, you know, take a board of directors approach to leadership. Listen first, facilitate second, ask questions third, advise fourth, make decisions fifth. And certainly as an early leader, right, like a lot of times you don't give probably the autonomy that you could and should to your team. You want to jump in and leave from the front and make decisions. I had a really hard time with this. Like, I just wanted to be in the problem and be part of the solution. And so I would say, like, that's probably the biggest mistake that most leaders make early in their careers, thinking that they need to show and be right there and, like, doing things for their reps or with their reps and not giving enough autonomy for them to learn and grow on their own. And so my advice would be take a board of directors style of leadership like Andy told me to do, and it's still still a work in progress for me. I promise. But that was really helpful advice. I wish I would've gotten way earlier. Awesome. Well, Anthony, phenomenal show. Welcome back to the show again, and everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers, folks.

I think there's some really interesting concepts in there around book of business construction. And then, you know, Anthony's whole thing of moment that matters, he told that story about Cisco, and I felt, like, a little inspired by that. Like, what do I want to do that's memorable? Where are points of, like, one of my reps goes on a parental leave? Like, that's a great moment. Like, just checking in, like, a couple weeks afterwards and asking for baby pictures and then, you know, hemming and hawing about how cute their little new kid is. You know, that kind of stuff really matters, and intentionality always leads to success. So I just love that little concept he had. So, folks, if you like this one, the same trio, me, Mark, and Anthony actually did a webinar on forecasting a month or two ago, give or take. And so go check that one out on the show notes if you like what you saw here. Anthony is a forecasting savant, and it was me, Mark, and talking about another controversial topic in addition to territories forecasting. And if you like this one, folks, stay tuned for next week. Cheers.
