## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this q four twenty twenty three year end road map special of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my lovely cohost, Kringle, Nick Segelski. Nick, what are we gonna cover today? Well, Armond, every single quarter, we cover three things now. One, what are the new products and things coming from thirty Minutes to Presidents Club? Two, we've got some brand spanking new club members that we're gonna be introducing. And then three, we're gonna take you through the Tactic TV lineup so you can mark your calendars for some good old tactic teardowns. Alrighty, folks. So one of the biggest launch quarters we've ever had. Let's start with new products. At last, if you have been on our 30 MPC newsletter, you have heard us talking about it, and we are officially launching our leadership content lines. You know what's really funny is you can find a million ways on how to do a cold call, a million ways on how to write a cold email. But when I was practicing to become a VP of sales, I never could find anything good on how to do a pipeline review, on how to hire someone, on how to forecast, on how to manage a board, on how to manage a CEO. And the leadership content in the world is absolutely garbage. And the problem is most sales leaders aren't amazing either, and so we're gonna interview the good ones. And we're doing leadership content on every channel. That means a leadership podcast, a leadership webinar series, AKA Tactic TV, and leadership tool kits, whether it's a pipe review template or something else. And my lovely cohost, who's almost as good looking as Nick is going to be the one and only Mark Casaglow, the CRO of Catalyst and one of the people who I have personally learned a tremendous amount of actionable leadership tactics from. This is going to be the go to podcast that you can find everything you need to either become a better sales leader if you're already one or become a sales leader eventually if you're a rep. Or even if you don't wanna be a leader, you'll be able to understand how your managers, directors, or VPs of sales mind operates so that you can be a more effective team member. Now while Arman is doing all of that, he's about to be a pretty busy guy, but do not worry. He is still going to be with me on the original 30 MPC podcast where we interview individual contributors about the actionable, practical things that they are doing to sell more effectively. But we are gonna be bringing on another voice for two reasons. One, it's just too much for Arma to be recording 42 podcasts a week. And two, we wanna highlight other voices who are really, really, really good. And we've interviewed a lot of really great salespeople on our podcast, Arman, but there's one person that stood out way more than all the rest, at least to me, and that was Jen Allen Knuth. Jen is amazing, and she is gonna be joining us for every other individual contributor episode going forward. So it's gonna be me and Jen, and that's gonna be a lot of fun. And while Nick and I had a really violent breakup conversation, we chose to lovingly stay together. But to just double down on what Nick said, one of the most awesome things about recording these most recent episodes is the chemistry oftentimes makes the interview. The chemistry oftentimes changes the interview as well. And I'll tell you the types of questions that Nick and I asked together have started to follow a somewhat similar pattern at times, and the guest is oftentimes the one who changes things up. But I've found in interviewing alongside Mark, and I've seen it as Nick has interviewed with Jen, the types of questions that come out in these interviews are new, fresh, and different, and that's what other cohosts allow us to do for the show. It's not just such that Nick and I have less talk time, but it also changes the chemistry and the dynamic of the interview so you all get different looks at sales. Because after doing a 150 plus episodes together, we've started to see the same patterns over and over and ask questions that at times we might even know the answer to versus Jen might have a completely different angle on something. And so what you will be seeing is all of these episodes will still be dropping on the main 30 MPC podcast feed. On Tuesdays, you will get the original sales show. On Thursdays, you'll get the leadership show, and those will be designated with their appropriate episode numbers. And in brackets, you will see, for example, episode 156, sell. Episode one fifty seven, lead. So you will be able to decide which episodes you listen to. And then on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we will have our other drops. Most commonly, on Mondays, we have the hall of fame episodes. On Wednesdays and Fridays, we do a cross promotion of our YouTube channel. And, of course, you can always watch those YouTube videos live on the channel as well, but you can always catch them on the 30 feed too. So I'm so excited about all this new content that we have coming, especially the leadership stuff, Armand. I know like, I run our sales at 30, and I'm excited to hear the best practices on how to forecast and how to communicate with the team as as we grow our business over here. Now in line with all of that stuff coming out, we are also introducing not one, not two, but three new members to the thirty MPC club. As a reminder, the club are the best of the best of the best sellers out there. The folks that you and I have personally learned the most from. The first two new entrants to the club for this quarter are the folks that we talked about who are gonna be joining us as cohosts on the show. So Mark and Jen are gonna be coming on as new club members. But then the third member is Vin Metano, who's a senior AE over at Demandbase. And Vin is someone who we've had on multiple times. He was one of our first ever two part episodes that we've done. This guy is one of the best cold emailers that I've ever met, and he is a real creative prospector. I'll never forget him talking about using Twitter to break into key accounts. And so I'm really excited to bring him on more for some of the stuff that he does because he's a prospecting expert in a time that it's really, really tough to build pipelines. So welcome, Jen, Mark, and Vin to the club. Boom. And what better way to welcome those club members than to have them do the good old home run lap and have them host a couple of tactic TV shows. So here are the three sales tactic TV shows In October, you got BeatChat GPT with Vinh Metano, Alan Shen, Jason Bey. And lastly, Bilal Betrau. In November, tear down that tape. The gnarliest discovery stuff you've seen in your life. You've got Jen Allen, John Barros, and the discovery wizard himself, Charles Mulbauer. And then the last one is tear down that cold call with the worst host of them all, Nick Sigelski hosting alongside Morgan Ingram, also a club member, and then lastly, with Jay Pollard, an absolute cold calling machine. And there may be one more crazy year end finale wild guess on that one, but we're not gonna reveal it quite yet. From there, you don't just get three tactic TV shows about sales tactics. You're gonna get your first ever two leadership tactic TV episodes. In October, we have the beginning of a founder series, 0 to $10,000,000 of ARR. For those of you who don't know, I was the ninth employee at a company called Pave and brought them from 0 to 10,000,000 plus, and there are so many learnings in the early stage founder life. And so the first episode of the founder series in October is going to be how Pave went from 0 to $10,000,000 in ARR in under two years. And it's featuring the CEO of Pave, Matt Shulman, one of the best sales driven CEOs I've seen in my life, the first sales hire at Pave, Killian Marsh, the second sales hire at Pave, me, and then the third sales hire at Pave, and one of the best sellers that we've ever had on the show, Morgan Mello. And if you didn't like that, guess what? You got even more coming in November, which is how to forecast for one, ten, and a 100 reps. And that one is featuring our club member, Mark Casaglott alongside Anthony Cesario, and lastly, alongside me as well. And that's what we got for a wild year end finale, folks. And so based on what you heard today, I would love to hear from you personally. The best way to reach me is boringemails@30mpc.com. Yes. Boringemails@30mpc.com. If you sign up for our newsletter, you can also just reply to that, and it goes directly to me. And I reply to every single message I get unless you say screw you unsubscribe. Then I don't reply to those ones. And what I would love for you to tell me is whether it's a new Tactic TV concept, whether it's a new club member that you'd like to see part of the club, or there's a new leadership concept or form of leadership content that you would really like to see. Please, please, please send me an email and tell us exactly what you'd want to see, and we always roll these things into our road maps for future quarters. Arman, I got one last ask for the audience here because normally this is the chance for you saying, Nick, how can people help us out? And it is, if you know a sales leader who's not listened to the 30 MPC podcast before because they're like, it's mostly stuff for reps. It's stuff for ICs. Let them know and give them a heads up that we've got some leadership stuff coming. We're gonna be interviewing some really, really great leaders, and we'd like to expose that so that everyone out there can upskill. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes.
