## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my co host Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the one and only, the author of the Medic book, mister Andy White. Nick, why should people listen? You may or may not have heard of Medic and we're not talking about the folks who wear the white lab coats at the hospital. We're talking about one of the most well known sales qualification methodologies that gives you a sense of is your deal gonna close or are you missing a critical element to getting the deal done? And what Andy has done is taken that medic framework and given us actionable ways to actually bring it into play with your customer. Three, two, one. Medic. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright. Andy, welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Alright. Thanks, Aman. Thanks, Nick. Thanks so much for having me on. The first actionable takeaway is this one. It's a small little line you can use that's gonna help you tap into the mind of your customer to help unpick exactly what their process is they're gonna go through when they're making their decision. What I find is that if you ask a customer, hey, what's the what's the process you go here internally? They look forward and they think about all of the things they know that, that what they see when they look forward. But if you ask them this one little hack, which is what happened the last time you bought a solution like mine? They tap into their memory, which seems to evoke a whole ton of extra insights. And what you find is they go, well, it's funny you should mention that the last time I bought a solution like yours, it was ABC and, it was a nightmare. We actually have got this really weird security process and it takes it takes it's gonna take your team two weeks to do. It's gonna take our team three weeks to review when you get back. And all of a sudden, just from that one little hack, you found out something that's gonna give you insight into something that if you would ask them outright, you'd never normally find out. So that's the first one. Second one is to qualify out for two reasons. The first is if you go to qualify out and by the way, when I'm talking about qualifying out, I'm talking about having a polite conversation with the customer that says, hey. This doesn't feel like this is a priority for you guys right now. It's as simple as that. We're not we're not doing anything other than just kinda calling that out. One of two things happens. The first is the customer will agree with you. They'll say, actually, you know what, Armand? You're right. This is not top of our priority list right now, but we've really felt this has been a great engagement. Let's touch base in six months, which is a good outcome. Right? It's a good outcome. It saved you a load of heartache, both yourself and then reporting up the chain with forecasting, all that sort of stuff. The second thing that happens is the customer won't let you qualify out. They'll turn around and say, woah, woah, hang on a minute. No. No. Don't no. We are genuinely interested. We're sorry if we gave you the impression we weren't. And what you find is they start behaving then. Some customers think that by showing too much interest, you're gonna perform some sort of Jedi mind trick and like sneak an order form underneath them if they show too much interest when we know the best buyers, the ones that kind of come to the table mutually with you to kind of find value. So that's the second one. The third one is just two words as well. It's so what? And what this is is if you're trying to articulate your value proposition and you if you're if you're smart, you'll be thinking about this with your team. You'll be collaborating and practicing your proposition. And it goes like this. If you're gonna say whatever area of value you think you offer to that customer and you can ask yourself, so what after it and give an answer, then you've not articulated the value well enough. I think we as salespeople, because we know our proposition so well and we're so familiar with the value it gets, we forget our customers are like brand new brand new to what we do in our proposition. So just help us get get to the really obvious part of it. Boom. Alrighty. So before we jump right in, I thought it would be helpful to just define MEDDPIC for everyone for those who haven't heard about it. So MEDDPIC is is a a generally known, philosophy around forecasting, qualification, and just generally a deal dynamic so that you make sure that, if you think a deal is gonna come through, you really know it's gonna come through. The eight letters in MEDDPIC are metrics, economic buyer, so someone who can approve the budget, decision criteria, which is what are the technical and business requirements, the decision process, right, how do they actually go about making a decision internally, the paper process, think, red lines, things of that sort, the identified pain, the champion, and then the competition. So those are your eight letters. So, Annie, my question for you is, I get on to my first discovery call, and I have eight letters swirling from my head. How do I get these in my sales cycle in a way that feels organic and I'm not just like, alright, let's start with step number one. What are your metrics? Yeah. Great question, Aman. It's a it's a really common question I get because it just kinda makes sense. When you see an acronym built out like it is, you kind of wanna think that you have to kinda go through, you know, in order first and foremost, and the fact that you'd actually think that you have to kind of extract all that information. The way I best answer that question is to kind of answer it from how I think about MEDDPIC, which is a framework that works alongside salespeople that know what they're doing, that know how to sell, and it helps them focus on the right things at the right times. Keep what I like to say is keeping them on the front foot. And it for me, it splits into three pillars. The first pillar is around value. The second pillar is around stakeholders, and the third pillar is around process. And if you think about any any kind of sales engagement with a kind of a complex sale of a value sale, it really just focuses on those three things. No no salesperson would argue those three things aren't the most important things for you to focus on. And so when you think about it from that lens and we think about, well, it's really important we sell about value. It's really important we think about all the stakeholders and what value they care about. And then also, when it's right, we think about the process in which the customers go to. You kind of see it from a different lens where you don't actually have to check off, like, all of the letters, and you actually think about the letters from a perspective of, okay. I'm engaging with this customer. It's really important I find pain. When I find the pain, I wanna align that pain to value. And then, of course, not everyone has the same pains. Not everyone cares about the same value. So let's start to think about which stakeholders are relevant here. But the really, like, that's kind of the zoomed out version. Like, the the really short answer to your question is that you don't have to kind of go through every letter. In fact, like, there's some letters like the paper process, unless, like, there's an NDA, which is kind of part of the paper process. You're probably not gonna be thinking about the paper process until maybe at the earliest, the second or third meeting in a lot of cases. So I think about it very much more of a, a framework that's there to help you kind of stay on the front foot. And don't think about it like a checklist. That's the wrong way of thinking about it. So, Andy, let's dive a little bit deeper here on you you mentioned this concept of qualification. A lot of times, buyer folks on the sales side are afraid to tell buyers we're not willing to focus on that stuff, what are some of the early things I can pull out of a sales cycle that should tell me I shouldn't spend time? Yeah. Great question. Well, the the the first and the most obvious one for me is that the customer needs to be willing to enter into what I cast as like a an exchange of value. You as a salesperson, you know you can't do the the kind of job that we all aspire to do, which is to focus on value, focus on really what matters to the customer without that customer being open to talk to us. You know, we can't, you know, if if they're not willing to sort of share their goals, their challenges, the things that they really care about, then we're kind of just guessing wildly. And, you know, we can, of course, we can do things like read the annual report. We can think about other customers we've worked with that probably have similar sort of goals and challenges to the customer we're talking to. But the whole point here is if we've if we're approaching an opportunity in a manner where we've we've researched the customer, we know we know from their industry, know from other customers like them we've worked with what kind of goals, challenges, and the ways that we our solution can help. If we if we go into an engagement and we're presenting that from a position of, like, you know, this is what we do, this is who we help, and the customer's not prepared to kind of throw you a bone and give you kind of some insights into if that's relevant or if it's if if they have if they're seeing the same kind of challenges or pains or have the same kind of goals, then that for me is a massive red flag about perhaps, like, either that customer doesn't see the value in your solution enough. They don't have enough pain for it to to kind of get the urgency it would need to get a deal done. Or perhaps, like, they're just not a a kind of a a a a a stakeholder that you wanna engage with because they're they're even not an experienced buyer. They don't have the power or influence to get a deal done. So, Andy, in a situation I'm on the Zoom meeting and I'm talking with Arman, and I'm feeling that he's he's just not giving me what I need. How do I react in a situation like that? Do I just immediately go to seems like you're you know, this isn't a priority. See you later and qualify them out? Or do I do I say something to try to get him to lean in a little bit? Yeah. Great, great question. I think the mistake commonly salespeople make now, which is they do one of two things. They they know that they have to kind of get some discovery, but they also know that their customer wants to know about their solution. So they sort it's almost like a a a a crossroads you go to and it's like option a is we get into pitching. We hope that that there's something in my slide deck that appeals to the customer that they'll go, oh, yes. Let's talk about that. Or option b is we go, well, we know we shouldn't go straight into pitching, so we should do some discovery. And we go, right, thanks for coming to the meeting, man. What's keeping you awake at night? And, you know, what does that mean if you don't solve that? And, you know, who else cares about this? And the customers, they're going like, what? Like, I I is this an interrogation? Right? So that's the I think your question kind of comes from a position where, like, that could have been the case where, like, either I've done the pitch and it's not resonated or I've kind of not won the credibility or the right to ask those questions yet. And so that's why the customer's kind of standing off a bit. So let's flip it around. Let's say I go into that meeting and I say, Aman, great to meet you. You know, ahead of this session, I was I was doing my research, which like, by the way, I know you you know, by the very virtue of listening to this podcast, your your your listeners are like higher level than the average of our industry. But I have to say from my experience, the average in our industry, like, they think that, like, research is googling the company's logo and putting it on the slide deck. Like, that's like from what I see, that's what they think is research. I'm talking about taking time ahead of that meeting to kind of research the customer, research their business, look on, you know, all the good stuff. We know that, you know, some of your great guests before have have really done a great job of of of giving us, like, really good ways of preparing for a meeting. We go into that meeting and you can say not just, like, based on the research I've done. So straight away, the customer's like, you did some research. Okay. I'm listening now. I was looking at customers, that we work with that I think, are similar to your business. Because what I was looking to do was I was trying to come here today to to show you how our solution, I think, could help you. What I found was there's this one company. Right? You're Adidas. So this one company, Nike, we've helped. Before Nike worked with us, they had these problems, and that was costing them this much money. Before, and then after taking on our solution, we were we helped them to solve those problems by doing this. And what we're seeing from them now is they're getting x percent higher this, x percent more efficient that. Does that resonate with you, Iman? Is that the kind of thing that, you know, is aligns with some of the things you're focused on? Straight away, you're more you're more you should be more interested if I've done my research right or like it may be the case, it's not the right opportunity. We can't win them all. Right? But what I've done there is a few things that I think are really cool. The first is I've shown up, I've done my research. We already talked about that. The second is I'm talking about a reference. So I'm reference selling straight away, but I'm reference selling with a story. This is how things were. This is how things are now, which, you know, we know that our customers, when we sell stories, they start to use different parts of their brain, which kind of makes things just a bit more visual and all the good stuff that goes with that. The other thing we're doing is we're not calling their baby ugly. Right? We're not coming in and going, hey, you know, I was on your website earlier and, you know, it took me thirty seconds for a page to load. What what's what's that all about? Like, yeah, that's really bad. Do you know that's costing you 4% conversions, and which would probably lead to a million dollars lost a year and stuff like that? We don't do that because the customer's like, well, who who's this like guy coming in giving me this? So we we we we talk about somebody else's ugly baby. They look at it and they can say, well, there's someone here that can actually help me with this. Mhmm. So oftentimes, you might say, oh, with Nike, we reduced x by y or whatever it might be. But let's say I'm selling a tool where the ROI is a little bit more challenging to quantify. So a good example would be a tool like Asana. It's a task management software. And I suppose you could quantify the number of the amount amount of hours you spend managing tasks and how much faster it would be as with Asana. But the reality is there are many other, like, emotional problems and just general reasons you should have a task management software. So how do I balance trying to, like, count the dollars and cents in metrics with just putting a bunch of vanity metrics out there so that my buyers are like, dude, this is, like, nowhere even close to real ROI. So that's a really good one. Using your Asana example, which is a killer example because I really that's probably one of the hardest I've ever heard to kind of try and pull a metric out of it because as you rightly say, that kind of that value of kind of is real efficiency value, isn't it? So it's like, what is the delta between that and then? The way I would get into that is, again, it comes back to stakeholders. It depends who you're talking to who care about what, you know, HR, and people teams will care more about, you know, the the the happiness of of of the teams and the tools they're using, whereas the CFO is gonna care more about, you know, the output and the efficiency of the team. So let's so let's say we're talking to the CFO. I would be wanting to, with that organization, try and find out how much time is being lost, by inefficient processes, which Asana could fix. And I would be, you know, to your example where there may not be, like, really meaningful metrics I can bring from another customer, I'd be looking still to use the use cases and the anecdotes and then just try and extract from the customer I'm talking to about how, you know, how many people do they have, how many projects are they running, how, you know, how how how how many people are in the solution, how much time do you think is being wasted, and then you'll start to get a picture. We I always say like this with metrics, you're really just helping the heart with the head, and it's kinda giving the business cases really kind of underpinning what the customer will feel in their heart is the right solution for them from your engagement. It just gives them the business case that they can then walk around the business and kinda get stakeholders in based on logic rather than emotion. And that actually goes back to the skill of the salesperson themselves to propose the business case in a manner that is appealing to the customer. I think so often now, you know, ROIs and and business cases, they're so common and salespeople forget that we have to actually kind of like, the customers are not just gonna go, yeah. Great. Business case. Give it to me. You have to kind of sell that. It's a it's a selling tool, so we need to kind of propose the benefits to the customer from it. And if we do that in the right way and we we're we're pulling on the right levers, then they should be very, very interested in in you working side by side with them to build a business case. I would say that in answer to your question, if if you're really struggling to to get that person to kind of give you that that kind of the the the the insights and so you can build that business case, then they're probably not maybe got that much pain or you haven't tapped on something that they're really gonna be, like, keen on solving. So, Andy, I wanna get on the topic of power, and I wanna throw a scenario that I had recently at you. I reached out to a law firm that I was trying to sell to, and I reached out to the managing partner, like the CEO of the law firm. And he referred me to the COO of the law firm, which is still a pretty great meeting for me to have. And the COO said, great. Let's set up a meeting. Here's the three people I'm gonna bring to that meeting. It's gonna be me and these two others. I show up on the Zoom and the two lower level people are there and they said, hey, sorry. The COO can't make it. And one of these people was like an analyst. And the first thing that came out of her mouth on that meeting said, I looked at your website and even if your software was free, I don't think we would use it. And so I'm in this tough scenario where I haven't said a word. I show up. I'm smiling. They turn on the Zoom, and the first thing she hits me with is that. And I'm not at power. And one, how do I react in a situation like that? Let's tackle that first. Wow. Okay. So I think this this is a very much a style question for me. So that my style in approaching this, I'm quite a kind of kind of jovial in those kind of situations. So I'm like, well, I would be like, woah. Okay. Wow. Well, blimey. If I've I've felt like that ahead of a meeting, I'm just glad you're here. So thank you so much for coming. Cause I'm trying to like I don't wanna like have confrontation with this person. So I'm like, well, thank you so much for coming. Why? Why? I have to ask that because that's that's crazy. That's the, that's the craziest opening to a call I've ever had. Why, why, why did you agree to come to the meeting? And then of course she's gonna have to say, well, my bosses said like I should come. I'm pretty sure that would be the answer. And and then you say, oh, why why did you think he or she wanted you to come to the meeting? Everyone's so busy. They're not gonna be like, oh, this guy, he reached out. He really nailed his outreach and so I feel obliged to meet him. Right? That doesn't happen in our world. So, you know, we all know how quickly people are to cancel if if they've lost the interest. So there must have been something there, and I don't know. I just I find that such a contentious, like, attitude to have. I would almost make it my, like, goal to win that person over. I'm, like, almost wanna I almost wanna, like, as a personal goal, put inside my deal. I wanna, like, see if I can win that person over, and that's that would be what I'd be trying to get to the bottom of. What did you do, man? I tried I I tried to follow your goal. I tried to win that person over. I failed. And then I've reached out to the COO, like, six times, and they haven't responded. And so to follow your qualifying, I said, alright. Like, I'm moving on. I I can't waste any more time or emotional energy on on this deal. So for me, this is where salespeople act too much on their own. You know, we're we think about we our roles as salespeople. Right? But we don't have to. We can rely on our executive team. We can rely on our leadership team. We can rely on our subject matter experts to kind of open up those other lines of communication. One thing I always did was I would, if we had an opportunity where you know, that we were excited about when I was a sales leader, I would always reach out to who we would identify as maybe a senior stakeholder, maybe multiple senior stakeholders ahead of the meeting. And, you know, there's no ask. We're not trying to we're not trying to pull, them into the meeting. We're not trying to do anything other than just open up an additional line of communication. And the amount of times that deals have gone quiet, customers started ghosting us, and we've thought, well, nothing left to lose. We've got that link into that c level person. And you you follow-up and and all of a sudden it kicks the deal back into life because they were interested. They're keen on solving the problems that you solve and they kind of, you know, it comes back down down the chain and then all of a sudden the customer comes back to life again. So I would just say that, in those instances, of course, we can't win them all, and there's always gonna be situations where customers just, you know, they're gone, and that's that's fine. But if you've got an opportunity that you you're really excited about and it's it's worth the while of the wider team getting involved in it, then I'd be I'd be trying to line up other stakeholders to to to take ownership as well. Andy, what do you have your c suite people say when they do that reach out with no ask? Is it just, hey. Meeting with Arman next week. Just wanted to let you know. Like, what what are they saying? Yeah. It's it's super simple. And, again, it goes back to that aura of being like, hey. You'd be really pleased because we work with all these companies, and we we chose you to work with Next. Like, that's the that's the impression that the whole the whole proposition should come with. And so it's like and and and by the way, secret here, like, when I was, when I was a sales leader, I would adjust my email signature title to match the person that I'm writing to just to make sure I felt like on on par with them, which is, you know, not so much I'm not like I wasn't calling myself the CEO or anything like that, but like if there was like a a regional leadership thing, you know, in some like in in Europe, directors are really high title, but in in in US, like, the equivalent is like VP, so I would adjust it accordingly. I'd reach out and I'll say something like this. I'd say, hey, Nick. My name's Andy. I run, this region for for this company. We work with organizations like a, b, and c, and they'd obviously be super relevant. My, Stephanie and Joe in my team are meeting, and I might name check their team, might not, depends on the the the field, in your team, and we're really excited. Here's the reason why we're excited. Dun dun dun. Couple of bullet points. All I wanted to reach out to you is to say that we're excited for obvious reasons. And, I wanted to open up a line of communication to you to say that if this meeting goes well as we expect it to, then I'm gonna be the executive sponsor on this project. And I wanna just open up this line of communication to you so you can contact me anytime. Right now, no ask. I'll probably check-in with you if the meeting goes well just to let you know how we think it went, but that's it. Obviously, expanded a lot there in the way I've extracted that, but it's really just short and punchy of, like, this is what this is who I am. This is what we do. No ask. And that's the really important bit I've always seen. There's no ask right now. I just wanted to let you know kinda thing. Well, the brilliant thing that you're doing there, I love the keyword, I'm going to be the executive sponsor on our end because, like, I'm dealing with this at my business right now where when we bring on a customer, we're also bringing on risk and we need an executive to say, hey. Like, we should bring this customer on. And so what you've done is you've you've signaled, hey. We're getting power involved on our end. We're sponsoring this on our end. We're making a commitment on our end. There's no ask, but, like, we're invested in this. And that gives you grounds then later if they're ghosting you to be like, hey. Like, what's going on here? It also makes them feel much more important when it's like, oh, this isn't just Andy running Rogue trying to win business for this huge company. It's like, there's an exec involved in this thing. Yeah. And there's one more bit that I missed out that I I often will do as well. If it's if it's not that first meeting, So if it's following a first meeting or a couple of meetings, then I will name check the people in that person's team and say what a great job they're doing because they cannot then complain if you've complimented them to their boss. Right? They can't complain. It's like it's a good thing for them all of a sudden. I have three examples of where this has worked that are really noteworthy. The first one was where a customer, said they'll do an NDA after a really good first meeting. They said they'll do an NDA. They ghosted us, went to ground completely for us, with us. I'd already done the reach out to the CEO founder who had replied back, been very friendly, and we thought we got nothing left to lose here. Let's do it. It reignites the opportunity. Not only did it reignite the opportunity, he introduced us to a CCO in their business and that person took ownership of the project. Whereas before we were a couple of levels down, got the deal done. So that deal was in our mind, we were like about to close lost it, but it reignited because we had the we already had the line open. Just last week, CRO and president of a company, that that exact template I just gave you, his email this by the way, this is a legend in our industry. This is like one of the top five CROs out there. No word of a lie. Like there's a, there's a book not too far away from me who who this guy wrote. Right. He said to me, his email, Andy, I never ever replied to email, emails from salespeople, but boom. And then he was in. Like it was and I think it's just the no ask thing. It's like, I'm not asking you to anything. I'm just letting you know I'm here. Like, this is what I'm doing. It's refreshing. Right? This has been phenomenal. I'm super juiced up by what you just talked about. We're running out of time. We gotta move to the final question. The final question is this. We have talked about a lot of wonderful things that salespeople should be doing, but we need to talk about the inverse now. And so the final question is this. What is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it is because it is hurting them more than it is helping? I think it really goes back to qualification. We've talked a lot about this this idea of valuing your time, value you know, expecting the customer to have a, a mutual exchange of value with you. And I think the number one thing you can do as a salesperson today and today as well is just value your own time. Value your own time in a manner that tells the customer, hey. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna chase you around for this. Like, I've got loads of other opportunities. Have you seen how good our solution is? Right? That will give the impression, that that they should really be respecting your time or at least if not, then then move on. You know, we can't win them all. I had an RFP, blind RFP come through to me a couple of months ago. I I was very busy at the time, but it was a blind RFP. I don't do them anyway. It said, I I politely kind of said, these are my exact words. As a as a data driven salesperson, I know that you win less than 10% of blind RFPs. So I cannot devote the amount of time I'd want to devote to this and and do it justice. So I politely decline. I wish you the best in your endeavors. They replied back and said you'd been highly recommended. I think you had more of a chance at 10% of winning, but okay. We respect your decision. Two days later, the CRO reached out directly to me and said, hey. Let's have a chat. Not only did we have a chat, when I got on the call, there was like five people there. We we skipped the RFP, and they're my third biggest customer. I qualified out of that deal. Nobody regrets qualifying out. I love it. Andy, anything you wanna promote before we jump off here? I would like to plug my YouTube channel. I think that, you know, that's the gateway drug for for thinking about qualification a little bit differently. So I'd love people to to go and find us on on YouTube and it's it's medic, m e d d I c c. And, you know, I'd love you to subscribe there. That's what I'd love you to do. Andy, thank you so much for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Andy White include number one, instead of asking about the buying process, ask about the last time they bought something, and you'll usually get a story that tells you what the buying process was. Number two, if it feels like it's not a priority, call it out, save yourself the time of working a bad deal, or they'll justify why it is a priority. Which brings us to number three, when you get your executives into a meeting with their executives, have them remain in contact. Have them send a follow-up email. Do the exec to exec motion. And then lastly, number four, if you've done your research on someone, tell them that early on in the sales cycle so they know you came to actually play ball. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Listener, have you ever thought about connecting execs with thirty minutes to Presidents Club? What I mean by that is if you enjoyed listening to this show and you haven't done so already, consider sending this show to your boss and saying, hey, this show has helped me improve as a salesperson. Two great things will happen. One, you're gonna look like a superstar for owning your own self development. But more importantly, you will warm Nick's cold frozen soul and give me joy, which I'm missing nowadays. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes to presidents club.
