## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski. And today, it is the head of commercial sales, the one and only Chris Nethercote. Nick, why should people listen? So Chris just started a new head of sales role. What we got into were what he looked at before starting the job to build his hypothesis of what he would change, what he changed, how he changed it, and what problems he let burn. We got into things like building discount menus. We got into things about how he actually analyzed the data to form a hypothesis around accelerating sales cycles. This is a really great one if, one, you're starting in a new org or if you're moving to a new new segment or if you just wanna figure out how Chris made an immediate impact on the biz right when he joined. It started with a three call close and a two call close, and now it's a one call close. Let's roll. Alrighty, Chris. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Number one is learn the product, especially if you are new in your leadership role. You can't do anything very effectively if you don't have a really good understanding of your product as a new leader. The thing that works best on this is run some deals yourself, run a couple, get an understanding of the product, see what questions you get hung up on, and dive in dive in feet first. Here's a hint. Chris is not the useless VP of sales. What's number two? Number two is set dedicated times specifically for coaching. Have different one on ones. So have a specific one on one for pipeline. Have a specific one on one for coaching. This requires that you do homework as the sales leader to, you know, watch some calls, put some notes together. It also frames the meeting very well for your AE. They know that they're gonna be coached. They're in the right frame of mind to get feedback, which is much better than just peppering people with Slack and things that are top of mind in real time for you, but not real time for them. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Alrighty. Killer. Number three. Three is discount menu. I love putting a discount menu together. They'll look a little bit different for every company that you might work at, but it makes it really easy for your buyers to say, great. These are the levers that I can pull to get a lower price, and it takes away some of that weird negotiation. It makes it easier for pricing conversations to happen, particularly with AEs that are a little bit more junior in their career, and ultimately, it'll raise your ACVs because you make it simple. Talk to me more about this discount menu. You used this at your previous company, and you were now rolling it out at your new company. How did you explain this to your reps? So how did you explain, hey. This is something we're gonna be rolling out? Yeah. So the the first thing is you explain what's important to you as a company, and that is what dictates the inputs into the discount menu. It's really important that you get annual upfront net 30 or or better terms. That's a lever that you should offer to to your customers. Ultimately, what's behind it is allowing you to raise your ACVs by taking some of that discomfort away from negotiation. Some reps are just not going to be comfortable doing it. Some people just aren't comfortable talking about price. So this takes that away. It also makes it super easy for your customer to make a decision quickly. So the two outcomes when explaining this to reps are, one, this is gonna raise your deal values because you're gonna put a set menu in place, and there's a limit to how far you can go and your customer sees it and they know it. And then it's also gonna accelerate your deal cycles because you're not gonna have to schedule these long drawn out negotiation calls in most cases, and you enable the reps to do a lot of it themselves versus having to have escalation calls with leadership to really dig in on negotiations. There will be examples of that, but it's designed to make it easier and sell higher deal values. So one of one of the things you were telling me on the prep call was the different levers on that discount menu are based on what's important to your company. So Right. At your could you give some examples? So, like, current company, what are some of those levers? Previous company, what are some of those levers? And then maybe other examples that you know might be relevant to other people who are listening to this and thinking, I wanna build my own discount menu. Yeah. For sure. So current company, like, I just I just joined, but what's really clear is that I have we have two different sales cycles within within our commercial segment. So we have, like, this this small business segment, and then we have this mid market segment. The mid market segment, those deals are gonna be larger. They're gonna be a little bit more labor intensive. The the small business segment, those are obviously gonna be slightly smaller deals. We need to provide them with an amazing buying experience, but we also need to accelerate that buying experience so that they don't take into the time that we have to invest in those larger deals that might be worth three, four, five x of the contract value of that initial deal. So what's important for me, if you can put that together, is velocity. Right? So one of those things is if you sign up for a trial, I'm gonna incentivize you to sign on for an additional year within the the scope of that free trial. If you if we can help you make a decision within fourteen days, awesome. That is worth money to me for sure. So that is one discount lever we can pull. The other thing that's important to us, at this stage is we want word-of-mouth. We want positive sentiment out in the marketplace. I am totally willing to incentivize and offer a discount for folks that are willing to write a case study for us. Let's put them in the contract. If you're willing to do it and you have a great experience with us, cool. Here's a discount for a case study and your logo rights. If you're willing to commit to references, we can invite you into our sales motion, make suggestions. We're working with these folks over there. They have a very similar use case. We'd love to have you talk to them as the next step while you're evaluating. That's gonna help us accelerate the deal cycle, help people make decisions, and provide an excellent buying experience. Those are the things that are important for us right now at Common Room. Hopefully, that helps a little bit. Happy to go into more detail. Chris, when are you bringing this up in your sales cycle? Good question. So I've actually been thinking about this a lot recently. Typically, it's happening towards the middle end when we're having the pricing conversation. I'm wondering for certain segments if we should actually bring it up a little bit earlier and get that wheel spinning. I I don't know if that's the right answer yet. It's probably worth the test, and then we can iterate off of our learnings. Most of the time, it's been in the business case discussion. At metadata, we would do it, like, post demo, but probably even the call after the big full demo when we really ironed out all the use cases and we were walking through what the business case was with those folks. I think it might be interesting, to bring it up a little bit sooner given some of the speed at which some of our customers are are deciding, to work with us or not. How does that actually play out? Do your reps give the price and then they say, there's this menu right now, or what's the nuance in the delivery of the discount? Yeah. So far, it's been like, you know, customers will be like, hey. You know, what, like, what does pricing look like? Or maybe they'll ask, you know, the typical, like, how can we sharpen the pencil and that's why we start. Glad you asked. We make it really simple. Here are the different levers that you can pull on that can lower the price for you, and and and these are the things that we ask for in return. It sets the table for the give get relationship when you're running through that. So I imagine one objection that's running through an audience member's head right now is, okay. If I show them this discount menu, and one of those things is as long as you sign before the end of the month, you'll have access to this disc discount menu. There will be some prospects that will push back and say, aren't you gonna have the same Cheesecake Factory menu next month? And what's to say that because I just happened to show up at your door today, that I shouldn't be able to get the same discount that a prospect who signs next month gets. How do you handle that? Honestly, you have to be willing to say no, which sounds so simple, but we have cursed ourselves in sales of putting false teeth out there. We have to be real with it. If it's meaningful for us, then be real with it. You just have to be willing to say no, which is really hard to do. I totally understand that, but you have to be willing to do it. So the things that you have on your current discount menu are if somebody signs up during the trial period, if they commit to logo rights and writing a case study, if they have a good experience, and then another one is upfront committing to being a reference. How big are you making these discounts? And are they based on a dollar figure? Are they based Individually, they're not massive, but they can add up if you choose to stack all of them. Some of them are really easy. Like, it's very easy to say yes to references. That's great. Awesome. So there you go. There's 5%. It's a little bit harder to say yes to signing on before before the before the trial ends because that condenses the time in which you need to make the decision. So I'll just add, you have to run a really amazing buying process that is rooted in helping your customers make decisions instead of forcing them. Because otherwise, this doesn't work that well, and it probably degrades the buying experience because it's like, oh, man. I can't force me to buy, like, right now. I'm not ready. But if you've helped them get ready, this is a nice conversation. Hey. If you are ready to move forward, here's an option for you that I'm sure your CFO would like. So right now, the way I started it, and and we're testing this so it might, you know, subject to change, is for the commitment to refer like, three reference calls that I can call you for. I have that on for 5%. And then seven and a half percent if you commit to signing on before your trial ends. There were some others in there. I was, like, I'm toying with g two reviews and case studies and logo rights. Logo rights is in there at 2% actually right now. That's part of this process too is you get real time feedback on what your customers are willing to do, what they place value in, if they think the discounts are low, if they think the discounts are high, if they think they're fair, all that stuff, and then you can iterate over time. That's what we've set up so far. What do you do if someone's great? So I can add up 5%, 10%, 7% that gets me to 22%. But problem, Chris, is I actually want a 35% discount. So you're gonna have to figure out how to give me that. Why? I think that's going back to our sales process fundamentals. It's okay to say no. And again, it's recognized a lot of buyers are gonna do this. I had someone we were negotiating some metadata and they said to me, we have other software providers that give us an 80% discount. And I was like, great. I'm glad that you have that for them, but we have a different business, and we're not going to do that. If you've done a good job, of helping your customer see the value, then you've earned the right to say no. I think you just have to say no, frankly. You have to have a lot of confidence in your product. Having good product matters here, to be honest. What's your take on when a rep comes to you saying, hey. I presented the discount menu, but the prospect wants something that's not on that menu. They want, a second instance for a sandbox, or they want other things where it's, like, maybe less of the commercials and more of you're doing something less conventional with the product? Yeah. Oh, that's a good question. There's always gonna be outliers. Everybody has strategic logos. Everybody tiers their accounts. Everybody knows the value of certain accounts to their business. Be aware of that when you're entering these negotiations. I might say yes to that and consider those things for the right profile of customer. If that's going to unlock a new vertical for me, if having them as a reference is gonna open up, you know, additional doors for me or if it's a new use case that I can test and promote, those things are valuable. I might explore that with the customer. That's a great opportunity to coach your reps and say, use your judgment. These are the types of things that to guide your judgment, the things I just mentioned, then that's a great escalation. Let's get leadership involved. Let's talk about those things. You know, there's always I mean, there's always variability, but defining defining the guardrails are where those sort of boxes around the sandbox where AEs can play is pretty important in that context. The other thing that comes to mind here is Anthony Anarino was on our podcast a while back, and he wrote a book on competitors called eat their lunch. One of the things he talks about doing is if someone comes in with an unreasonable ask, you need to match it with an equally unreasonable ask. So if someone's asking for an off menu term or a 40% discount and your menu only goes to 17%, You can say, look, that that's not on the menu. I can talk to finance, but they're probably gonna ask me, can you do a three year deal with a full lock in and buy extra seeds and do wall to wall and seven more references? It just sets the expectation that there's gonna be a big equal give for every get they get in return. And part of the reason you can have that conversation is because you've already posed the menu that has a bunch of trades on it. You're not doing unilateral concessions. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. So, Chris, it sounds like this discount menu was one of the first things that you rolled out to the common room team, and you just started leading their sales organization not too long ago. I'm curious. Sometimes I've seen sales leaders enter an org. They're all about building pipeline. They're all about tearing up the sales process. They're all about negotiation. How did you figure out where you wanted to get started when you joined the team? So I actually figured out where I wanna get started before I joined the team, frankly, in the interview process. I will shout out the interview process is pretty awesome. I got access to a ton of data, call recordings, all of that stuff. As you're evaluating a new opportunity as a leader, having that insight before you jump in is super useful. I I had already formulated a hypothesis around sales process, how we structured POCs, what our free trial motion looked like, all that type of stuff. So I started before I got started, if you will. In looking at the data that we had, it was very clear that we had two different segments. In unpacking that and looking at our SMB and our commercial and our and our enterprise who Matt leads the enterprise team and I'm leading the, of the commercial teams. But it was clear we had these different segments. And so then I was like, alright. Well, let's look at the data individually. Let's actually draw the lines so that we can decide what we're gonna do that's based in data so that if you're rolling out a new process, AEs that don't know you and you have no rapport and credibility with yet are like, what are you talking about? Right? We wanna avoid that so that we can be bought in. So having that data and seeing that, okay, for companies that were a 125 employees and below, our sales cycles looked like this. They they were this number of days. Above that was this number of days. This is what the ACV was. This is how long they were in every single stage. And then actually going in and doing the work of watching the call recordings, looking at the deals, talking to your AEs about how they're running different things, and then saying, okay. I'm confirming or not confirming my hypothesis. In this instance, I confirmed my hypothesis, which was we should be like, we can run a lot faster deal cycles. Mark Koslow talks about this. There's really one simple thing too that, that you find when you start doing this is you start to look at how much time is in between every single step when you watch a Gong sequence or a Clari sequence or a call recording. And you're like, oh, man. Not only can we tighten up our buying experience and what we're doing live and in calls, but there are two weeks going by between each one of these calls. If you do that and and there's one deal that I'm that I'm thinking of. If you do that, what is that? Three times, four times? You're automatically adding six weeks to a to to to two months to your deal? That's crazy. Right? You don't have to do that. On the process itself, it was clear that we were letting our customers completely lead the process instead of us guiding them on how companies make the decision of whether or not to purchase common room. Not completely saying this is exactly what you're gonna do, but this is how companies typically evaluate us and then walking them through that. What was really clear is that in the free trial motion that we have, customers say, hey. We wanna spin up a free trial. Great. That's awesome. We have our first call. We flush out that there is value. Typically, from here, customers are going to spin up their instance. We're gonna send you some information about what data sources to connect and some Loom videos on some specific plays that you can create within your instance. You know, you're getting them started, but you're also giving them some homework, so they have to invest in this a little bit. We're gonna have three calls over the course of the next fourteen days. So call number one after this, so, technically, 4. Call number one after this is we're gonna spend an hour. We're gonna make sure you set everything up correctly. We're gonna show you live how to design some of these plays that we know based off our conversation are gonna be useful for you. And we're gonna sort of, like, lay out the road map for how that you you validate this both technically and from a use case. Then we're gonna let you play with it for a few days. Right? And so then five days later, we're gonna have another call. That call will be shorter, you know, typically about thirty minutes. We'll send you some information. These are the people that should be involved, on your side based on, what you've told us, someone from the SDR team, maybe a sales rep, etcetera. And we'll start to get a little bit more detailed into how you can design some of the custom things and automations. That's the third call. The fourth call is a feedback session. We'll review how this went, what you thought was working well, what was not working well, and decide if this is something that you wanna pursue moving forward with. And if you're ready to move forward, we'll talk about that. And if you're not, we'll also talk about that. But you're clearly setting the expectation that they're gonna spend about ninety minutes with you over the course of the next fourteen days. You have homework as the AE. They have homework as the customer. The expectations are very clearly set, and you're obviously gonna have touch points in between. And those touch points are really important too, coaching the AEs on what those should be. Loom video, set up Slack channel, open line of communication, making sure you're basically wrapping your arms around them while also not doing all of the work for them in our particular instance so that we can make sure they're invested in it just as much, as we are. What this will do, and so far it's working, is it'll shorten our sales cycle. It seems like it's more work than we've been doing with our other deals, but it's actually not because we are doing all these things. When you look at the deal structure and the email back and forth and Salesforce and Clari, you can see that these things are happening, but they're not happening succinctly, like, in a tight window. They're happening over a period of more weeks than it needs to for these particular organizations. With what we sell, you can make decisions quickly about whether or not you wanna invest in signal based selling or if you're ready for that and how it fits into your sales motion. It's an easy thing to validate, and so we just need to help our customers do it. Wanna recap a couple of the things that Chris was looking at. There are three types of problems you could solve in a sales organization. Prospecting problems, discovery problems, and process problems. For prospecting problems, you're looking at pipeline generation by source, figuring out if teams doing enough outbound. For discovery problems, you're watching the calls. You're looking at the conversion between stage zero and stage one to stage two. Right? Can people even get people to convert down the funnel? And then for process, this is where you got really smart is you're looking at your deal sizes, you're looking at the steps in your sales cycle, and you're looking at the spacing between those steps. Or some sales cycles taking too long and you could possibly combine some stages into one step or one call. Mhmm. But you zoomed in on the process piece because these are SMB deals. These need to be moving away faster. Let's look at our sales process. You found that the team was running POCs, probably throwing the product in the customer's hands and saying, play around with it, and at the end, let us know what you think. So you added more rigidity and forced a three call fourteen day POC, and that probably cut your sales cycle in half. And it also probably prevented your team from going after the wrong types of trials. Did I have that right? Correct. That is absolutely right and much more well set. Can I ask you a question? Because this is really hard. I've stepped into sales organizations, and I've been a bull in a China shop before. And I've seen a lot of VPs come in. They're like, screw everything you're doing. We're doing Sandler. And it goes totally wrong. So you come in, you have this discount menu, you have the new POC process, the new pilot process. How did you get the team on board with this and not have them feel like you were just coming in and changing everything up on them without acknowledging what was working? Two things. I spend a lot of time trying to unlearn who the person is on my team, not just as a celebrity, who you are. That does a couple of things. One, I really do care about the people on my team, and I want them to know that. That helps when we wanna make changes. You're building trust. You're building rapport. You're building credibility at a human level versus just like a employee employer level, which I think is important, which is a little bit, you know, you know, different than than sales tactics, but I think it's really important. The second part of it is I'm doing it also. I'm not just saying, hey. This is what I wanna do. Come back to me when you run run into an issue. I'm doing it too. Like, if we're gonna install new process, I'm going to run some deals side by side with you and do this too. And we're gonna see how it works because I wanna know what it feels like. I wanna know where I'm getting caught up because if I'm getting caught up, then I would expect other people to get caught up too. And I wanna feel that. If you're in the mud with your team, that lends you a lot of credibility. I'm not a big fan of just coming in and flipping the table over and making changes without having all the context. Changes will be made, of course, but doing it thoughtfully and tactfully is how they are actually successful. Doing the work is huge. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. You can't fix everything in your first month. You can't fix everything in your first quarter. What problems did you identify that need to be solved that you were okay letting burn for a time? So I think the biggest one is we have a capacity issue on my team. I have 50 deals open at a time. We have a ton of interest in our product, which is incredible. But that means we are losing deals because humans can only work on so many things at once and 50 deals is just not doable. Hiring became incredibly important and was the number one thing on my list even even before process. Process was, like, a short second because it would have an immediate impact for the reps that were here and help them run those 50 deals a little bit better. I have been at many organizations where I have seen people hire way too fast and not the right profile of AE, and that does them a disservice. It creates way more fires in the long term than it does sort of solve in the short term because then you're passing off deals to AEs that are not well equipped to close them. I'm saying all this because the fire that, like, chosen to let, like, I guess, like, smolder is that rep capacity. We have to solve it, obviously, but we did not make any sacrifices on how rigorous our interview process was in our rubric that we score AEs on when we're interviewing them because they have to be a really good fit. Because as soon as they come in, they're gonna get flooded with inbound, and they need to contribute. And it's gonna be an accelerated onboarding, and we gotta make sure we have the right profile rep that's important to us. So we didn't just hire the first cohort of of AEs and and stayed really rigorous. How did you manage that conversation? Because I've been on the receiving end of our mind. You've hired one rep or two reps per quarter. I want you to hire two reps per month. And I'm like, hold on. I'm not just gonna flood the team with junk because things are going well, but I've had that pressure from the board, from the founder, from the market, from the valuation, and all that stuff. Yeah. How did you tactfully push back other than just saying we're working on it? Honestly, I didn't have to, which was great if I'm being totally candid. The the pressure is definitely there to solve the problem, but there was never any push to change the rubric or the process. It might mean that I spend more time interviewing candidates, and my calendar is more full with interviews. I have to sacrifice being in other meetings, but there was never a push to sacrifice, on candidate quality because we all understand how important it is. I think lucky in that respect, like, fully supported there. Armand, how did you respond to the pressure as a sales leader? Yeah. So it's hard because you wanna push on the candidate quality bar, but it's a hard argument to hold up because it's sort of this abstract concept of why don't you just hire better people faster? Or why don't we hire five recruiting firms to get you better people faster and you can interview more? And I think this was especially the case in the bull market. Today, people are a lot more receptive to a bear market, be a little bit more cautious. Where I have found the most compelling argument to be is as follows. It goes back to Chris's point around identifying the right place to put your focus. And what is hiring going to do if everyone's pipeline is empty? Or what is hiring gonna do if this inbound leads are already stretched super thin? You might actually just have a top of funnel issue. So I would do things like pulling up reps' calendars and I'd be like, look. There there's not a lot of room to spread this around the team. Or I would look at things like pipeline generation per rep and how much inbound we were getting. And I would say things like, if this is going to scale as a team, everything needs to scale with it. Otherwise, what's gonna happen is the average win rates for a new rep versus an old rep. The average win rates for a newer rep was always lower. I've seen a lot of teams hire two or three reps, and sometimes revenue actually goes down because the leads aren't going in the hands of the best players. That's how I find you have to counter it. Today, everyone's a little bit wary of overhiring. People appreciate it when a leader doesn't wanna just hit their number by hiring a million reps. They wanna hit their number by hiring a fish. I would say, you know, I've I've seen that movie too. I've been an AE in an organization that was doing that. AEs don't wanna work there. Right? It it, like, it creates it creates a a a a attrition problem too for the top performers. You're like, what is going on? This doesn't feel like the place I was at before. I'm not in my number in the same way. It can really deflate the culture in addition to pulling the metrics down across the board. One of my old fellow first sales hires at Pave called it the cling to the middle strategy, which is when a team gets bloated, everyone at the top and the bottom leaves. You lose your best reps who are the most efficient, and you have to lose your bottom reps because your team is bloated. Then you're just sort of clinging to the middle mediocre layer and trying to get as many reps to hit quota, but no one's really crushing it. And it's just a very painful way to grow. So, Chris, this was a phenomenal episode. We have to move to our final question, and it is this. We talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit, but what is one bad habit that every sales leader should break so so that all teams can get a little bit better? Giving feedback and asking for, updates incessantly over Slack. Stop doing it. It drives everybody crazy, and that's yeah. That's what I'll say about that. No perpetual Slack twenty four seven pipeline reviews. Chris, amazing show. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Chris from common room. What do you have for your two? Number one is roll out a discount menu to empower your reps with the different levers they have available and speed that back half of your sales cycle by being clear about what's approved and what's not to help them with their buyer seller conversations. The things included on his menu were the customer's agreement to sign up and sign a contract during their trial period, agreeing to commit to a case study and logo rights, an upfront commitment to references, and he's playing with this one, g two reviews. Pick what matters to your business and build your own discount menu. Number two, before you join a new organization or a new segment, do things like looking at the data and listen to call recordings for that segment or team you're gonna be taking over. Chris looked at company size against sales cycle length, time in each stage, and ACV. And that allowed him to form a hypothesis of the areas he could have the biggest impact on his segments cycle. Number three. When you're coming in to diagnose problems in a sales organization, one thing that Chris looked at was the spacing between sales calls. And what he found is that you could consolidate a few steps into fewer steps, or you could reduce the spacing between how many calls you have in a sales cycle. And that brings us to number four. Chris introduced the three call fourteen day POC, a beginning, middle, and end checkpoint where you're not just throwing the product at the customer and saying, do you wanna buy it at the end of it? But you're dictating the exact trials they're gonna run, the things they're gonna do, and the exit criteria at the end. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here? One of my favorite leadership episodes of this show was one I wasn't on. It was you and Mark Casaglow doing a full deep dive on how to diagnose your pipeline problem. If you like the structured data breakdown that we talked about, how Chris evaluated company size, sales cycle, time and cycle, etcetera, you and Mark did a full deep dive on how to diagnose the data around where you might be struggling in pipe gen. That was a really good listen if your top of funnel pipe gen isn't where it needs to be and you need to figure out where to apply your efforts to make a fix. There's a link to that episode in the show notes. Go check it out. It's 30.
