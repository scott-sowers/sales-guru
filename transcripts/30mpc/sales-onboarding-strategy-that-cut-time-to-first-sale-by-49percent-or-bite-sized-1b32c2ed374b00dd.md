## Transcript

I've seen that reps that do really well long term often start fast, and so we focus a lot on how quickly we can get people to their first conversation. We actually decreased our time to first sale by 49% with three focus areas. Number one, knowing your territory. Knowing exactly which accounts spent time on first. Number two, understanding your personas, what they care about, the problems they solve in their words. And then finally, knowing our stories. How can we tell the value of our solutions in a compelling story where they captures attention? If reps are armed with just that, they're able to go create meaningful conversations, loop in the right people, and we can win deals quickly even without mastering all the other product pieces and other elements as you ramp. This rapid onboarding, super interesting. The thing that I missed though is product knowledge, and I think that's where, like, almost everybody starts. Like, as soon as you log into your Gmail, the next thing you're doing is going in and learn about the product. It's not even on your top three, man. You're having people have conversations without even talking about that. Like, what's going on? Yeah. And I I I I think it's a miss for most always leading with products. I'm not everybody's read the LinkedIn post problems for product. Nobody cares about your products, about the problems that you solve. But we sell a very complex product at LaunchDarkly. When we get into product, we've got multiple, like, integrations, back end versus front end, different personas. If I wanted a rep to get good at our product before having conversations, they're not gonna talk to anybody for six to nine months where their super isn't good. But the reality is I also have this massive supporting cast and ecosystem where if a rep can bring in a quality opportunity, we have SC support. We have mentors. We have sales leaders. We can go help bridge the gap of how the product actually works at a technical level As long as they know the right people to talk to and the problems we solve and some stories to earn the time, we can surround sound them to go. When we had a rep come in and in her first couple of weeks, self source a 6 figure opportunity, She had no idea what we do yet, but she was able to find a problem, bring in the right people, and close it all while she's ramping because of the the time of the conversation, not being slowed down by needing to know every nitty gritty feature in the product. I think a lot of AEs and leaders get this wrong. It's like, I'm not ready to talk to a customer until I know every feature. But what does your customer wanna talk about? Every feature that you can scroll through on a demo, or do they wanna talk about their problems in their language, the outcomes that you drive in their language, and some level of evidence that you've helped somebody similar solve those problems? It's gonna be the latter. And then hopefully, you're at a company. And if you're not, you might be at the wrong company that has plenty of people that know the product that can support you as you learn the product over time. So I don't want people to take this wrong. I'm not saying product knowledge isn't important. You should get good at your product. You should get great at your product, but it is not a prerequisite to talking to customers. So your theory is that if we can get people talking about the problems in the context of the peep of their buyers and can tell customer stories and understand which accounts to target because they're the most ready to go. We get people quickly into deals. And then when they're in a deals, their manager and their technical support team can guide them through a deal, and they're learning along the way. But, like, you would much rather have that situation than somebody be able to, like, do a deal all by themselves, but it takes nine months to get there. Exactly. What's, like, what's the what's the reasoning behind that? Like, help me understand, like, why you've landed there? Because that that is I've never heard of anyone that doesn't teach product before the first conversation. I'm like, tote you got my curiosity peaked to the max. Yeah. So I, I I think there there are two elements that we need to close a deal. We need to know that the product works, and we need to know that the product working leads to value that's meaningful. K. And that's overly simplified, but most sales processes, most sales teams go about it in the wrong order. Nobody cares if your product works, if they're not already convinced that the product working matters. It's why before we even go into a POV or a demo, I wanna validate at the executive level. Hey. If this actually worked, does it matter to you? Because, otherwise, what's the point of technical validation? And so when I think about the problem aspect, I don't need the rep to go in and talk about the nitty gritty details of the product until we validated a problem we're solving. And then from a customer standpoint, they don't wanna hear on a discovery call the laundry list of features that makes it work. They're not gonna believe it anyway. They wanna hear a proof point of a similar company organization that solved the problem using that service. That then gives you a license to go prove it with deeper technical validation. Today's show is brought to you by Texas, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghosted Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.
