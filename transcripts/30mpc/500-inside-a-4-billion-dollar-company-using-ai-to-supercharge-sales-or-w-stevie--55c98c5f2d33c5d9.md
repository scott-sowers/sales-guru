## Transcript

I actually am not a fan of AI written email or AI written content or automated outreach. We are hiring dozens of SDRs. We're putting them in person in an office, and we have them picking up the phone. So while there is this deluge of noise going into email of this, like, AI written, quote, unquote personalized outreach, we've got folks having real human conversations and doing deep discovery. And instead of leveraging AI to write the content, we are leveraging it to prep those people to have a meaningful conversation. We are leveraging it to increase their connect rates. We're amplifying what makes a great human conversation because we find that drives better metrics than pure automation of this outbound SDR. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Troc, and I'm here with my co host, Mark Cosclo. And today, we have one of the first leadership guests we've ever had, arguably the greatest leadership guest we had ever had. Her name is Stevie Case. She is the CRO over at Vanta. She's had a million and one awards, but she now runs a revenue organization of over 500 sellers, and she is figuring out how to use AI to automate massive parts of the prospecting process for 500 people at a time. And it's hard enough to do that for a team of five. And this is a master class in that. So, Mark, why should people listen? I think two things about Stevie are unique. One is she's yes. She's going crazy on AI, but with a mandate of human first, and they're still hiring tons of humans. So I think that's a very unique perspective because most people are looking for the replace. So and then secondly, the thing she's built converts outbound leads better than inbound leads. That is a rare thing y'all, and she's gonna spill the beans on some of the stuff she's doing to get that. Alrighty, Stevie. Welcome back to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. So actionable takeaway number one is as you are building this outbound machine, number one is you've gotta really intelligently surface the right contacts. This may seem obvious. This is something people have been doing forever, but I think AI is particularly well suited to help do this. We've been doing some really interesting work here, reverse engineering from our closed won, from the folks that we serve well and successfully as customers today, taking that profile, identifying not just the firmographics, not just sort of the basics of the account, but truly what that buyer who is successful looks like, what the signals are, what the size of the team is. You know, for us at Vanta, what this looks like is we typically have a CISO as our executive buyer, but all CISOs are not the same. There are classic old school CISOs who might be really attracted to an older tech stack. There are CISOs who have much more modern teams that look quite different. They've got a certain team makeup. They've got certain titles on their team. They've got a certain tech stack. It's a it's a certain size of company. So we take that data, we reverse engineer it, and we're using that to not just stack rank who we've got in CRM for outreach, but actually go out and do that enrichment, find those folks in the world, and then stack rank them and make them our top prospects that get the most love and attention. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Boom. What's number two? I I've got a little bit of a contrarian viewpoint here. AI is amazing. I am very bullish on the use of AI. But number two for me is taking what is great about humans and human outreach and human curiosity and then amplifying it to make it more efficient. So what that means to me is I actually am not a fan of AI written email or AI written content or automated outreach. There are arguments that it can work in in corners, but I think that that is a dying practice and that what really works here at scale is human beings and real human curiosity that drives rich discovery and something much more meaningful and personalized. So what this looks like at Vanta today is we are hiring dozens of SDRs. We're putting them in person in an office, and we have them picking up the phone. So while there is this deluge of noise going into email of this, like, AI written, quote, unquote, personalized outreach, we've got folks having real human conversations and doing deep discovery. And instead of leveraging AI to write the content, we are leveraging it to prep those people to have a meaningful conversation. We are leveraging it to increase their connect rates. So we are augmenting them. We're amplifying what makes a great human conversation because we find that drives better metrics than pure automation of this outbound SDR. Awesome. We're gonna have to talk about that. But first, what's number three? Okay. Number three is the feedback loop, and this is another place where I think AI can really change the game. So once upon a time, we had these big sales teams, and folks were relying on managers to give coaching. You know, you would have a call, and then you would potentially listen to the recording if you had one. Your manager might even be riding along to give you feedback. That is a wildly inefficient process. We have instead leveraged AI to create this incredible feedback loop. And what that looks like at Vanta is that, obviously, we record the call. We have also automated scoring of those calls, and we have automated feedback. So we've got a framework for what makes a great conversation. We have a certain checklist of things that we need accomplished in that conversation. We automate the scoring. We then provide that feedback to the rep in an automated way. So they are getting this very real time feedback and not just a sort of, like, scorecard. They're actually getting suggestions driven by AI about how they could have driven that call better, how they could have optimized the talk track, what would have been more efficient and effective. Again, this is getting reverse engineered from what we know works. And so then your manager can add some color on top. We've got very real time feedback about what's good and what's not good. We're using this for not just outbound prospecting, but onboarding as well. So we're leveraging technology like Hyperbounds, and we're having SDRs who are onboarding in our org have a conversation with AI and then getting real time feedback about the effectiveness of that talk track. What you described as the data point for an account, a CISO that has a certain team makeup, that's not just something that you put inside of ZoomInfo and filter on. Right? Even if you could, I don't think many people would think about that. So how how the heck did you pick one like that that's so specific? Like, what like, was that a human that thought of it? Did the AI suggest it? How did you get to that list? In the early phases, this was very much a human that thought of it. You know? The the initial phase of identification of this buyer persona was very human driven. So we identified some titles. We identified, you know, like, tech stack and some of these more generic things that you can get out of tools. Since then, we have gotten much more sophisticated, and we do have AI driving a lot of this analysis now. So, you know, the combination of the firmographic data and the intent data and then other data we can get out in the world about what that company is doing that are very unique to our business, these are the kind of things that when you get them in combination, it's it's too much data for human beings to go out and track down or for to to use, like, a classic tool like a ZoomInfo. When you're looking at AI, like, you can really pull together that that combination of signals in a very interesting way. You know, for us, we work in compliance. So, you know, we're looking at the way that companies present their security and compliance posture in the world. That can be a real indicator of how they run their program or how serious they are, how much they've resourced that program. So it's that combination of signals that's now AI driven that we have found the most effective. And are you having some AI running now that's looking for additional signals or maybe signals are dropping off in effectiveness? How are you I mean, that's a the list is my guess sounds kinda long. How are you maintaining it? Yeah. You know, it's an evolving thing, and it really varies by segment. You know, we sell to founders. The signals there are pretty consistent, and they are, very straightforward. So an example of that would be, we are out crawling the web to see, does this company have any representation of their compliance posture on their website? Do they have a SOC two badge? We also look at how long ago they incorporated. You know, we find we can sell to companies very early, so we're actually going out and looking for incorporation data and sort of all these, like, these data points that remain consistent. It's a little bit different when we look up market. So, you know, as opposed to a founder, these CISOs, they're evolving their programs. It's a very dynamic landscape. The size of their teams can grow and shrink. There are also these sort of interesting, events that can drive interest in a product like Fanta. So if you see, for example, that a company has had a breach or they had a regulatory issue or they shrunk the size of the team working for the CISO, you You know, there's this, like, dynamic nature of the business that we are tracking, and then we are acting on those signals as they grow and change. I was gonna ask, how do you actually do this? So, like, let's take this CISO example where I'm like, okay. I want CISOs at, like, this size of company with teams that have, like, two security engine engineers, not one, and and maybe their hats are blue and not red. It's like, how are you actually, like, using AI to get all this stuff into your system and then make sense of it so that a rep is like, oh, that's the one to go after versus this one is not? Yeah. It it is a combination of tools, processes, and people. And for us, a lot of the data gathering is Clay. So, you know, I think people think of Clay as very data enrichment, and it does that well. It also does this sourcing of signal in a really interesting way. So things like going out and sourcing incorporation data or is there a SOC two badge on a website, those are things we're leveraging Clay for. So we're leveraging that. We are leveraging some classic, tools for intent and and all of that as well, so things like Six Senses and the the classics. At the same time, where it's gotten really interesting is what we built in house. So we do have our own, analytics team. So we've got a revenue analytics crew led by a brilliant guy, Ryan Levy, and Ryan has built our own infrastructure and propensity model. And that propensity model, we surface those data points in CRM and in Tableau to our team and to our managers. So we've actually got, like, stack ranked propensity, and we've built different versions of that propensity model for SDRs, for AEs, and also for our account managers who do expansion, because obviously the way we think about propensity is different for those funnels. So that's all in house tooling and intelligence, and we're taking all that source data from lots of different sources, and we built our own algorithms, and we're doing our own analysis there. So we'll come back to the prioritization, or you called it the propensity, algorithm. If we go back to the piece where you're actually getting that data, you talked about using Clay. Like, what is Clay actually, like, doing to get stuff? Like, are you typing in, hello, Clay. Please help me find CSOs that look like this and corporation dates by this. Like, what does this actually look like just so people can understand, like, what Clay is actually doing to get this data? Yeah. Clay does a couple of different things. So one of the main things that Clay does is data enrichment. So they've got these great, tables and waterfalls where you can, put in a set of criteria for the types of contacts you're trying to identify, and it'll pull that in a way that is very unique across dozens of sources. So that's one. That's just, like, really optimized data enrichment. The second piece and where it gets interesting is the Claygent. So as you can imagine, the Clay agent, it's essentially an agent that does exactly what you just described. You can, you know, write a prompt, so you can tell it what you're trying to look for, and it will go out into the world and pull those signals into these unique and interesting workflows. Now one of the things that Clay, has really, as a team, but a proponent of is this idea of the GTM engineer and this idea that it's about more than human led capacity. You've gotta have engineers within your rev ops organization that can go out and assemble this kind of intelligence using these types of agents. So the beauty of it is you can write prompts. You don't have to sit here writing code unnecessarily, but you've got an engine that can go out and derive signal in ways that we never could have before because they've got this agent sort of workflow. So to put it together for folks, Clay, the way that you're using it is you're not having your SDRs go and enter a bunch of queries in the Clay. And I've seen teams try to do this where it's like, it's a pretty high learning curve of a tool, at least where it is today. It's basically like a spreadsheet meets ChatGPT for sales, where you can say, like, alright. In this column, I want you to find all of the LinkedIn profiles. And then in this column, I want you to look at all those LinkedIn profiles and pull out, like, CSOs that look like this. Right? It's like it can get pretty complicated, but it's really powerful. So you're having your rev ops team basically do that initial data pull. And then you've put together your own algorithm that prioritizes all of these different signals. And I'm curious, like, what makes this any different from traditional lead scoring, for example. Right? Yeah. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. I I think, honestly, like, the scale and complexity of the data we are assembling and the dynamic nature of that scoring are the two things that make it make it the most different. So it is similar in concept, but the way that we're able to dynamically adjust what works and doesn't work, the fact that it's got the feedback loop built in, the fact that we are then collecting that data from an on an ongoing basis from, like, close loss, close won, and then feeding that back into the system is really what makes a difference. So it is you know, traditional lead scoring historically, you sorta put a set of rules in place, and it was very static. And, you know, maybe you reanalyze that once a quarter, once a half. We are, you know, doing this in real time. We are analyzing on a daily basis in real time what is working and not working and how the market is shifting. That's allowed us to stay ahead. And you're exactly right that we have sort of obfuscated the complexity of these AI tools. We don't necessarily want our AEs or SDRs, like, in their writing prompts and doing all that. Like, we wanna take the guesswork out of this for them. So we are writing the prompts. We have built system. We then feed a dynamic list into CRM for them. So all they know is they've got a stack rank list, and it is ready to go, and we're actually feeding them prep. So, again, historically, we had folks going out doing research and, you know, they might get a stack rank list of contacts, but then figuring out what to say to those contacts was challenging. We're actually prompting them with prep that is unique to that persona and buyer. Are you delivering all that in Salesforce or in Outreach, or where are you delivering it? We're delivering it in Salesforce. In some cases, we are delivering a templated version of that into Outreach. We are really seeking to discourage this idea of I have been fed, an email template, and I'm just gonna hit send. That is not what we want here. What we wanna give them is the context, something to start with, but the expectation is that they are then personalizing it and making it meaningful in a way that feels more human. So we're feeding them raw materials, and then we expect them to make it more personal. So we're recording this on a Thursday. On Friday morning, I'm an SDR at Vanta. I walk in, and I have a Salesforce report, a list view of here's your 20 contacts for today, stack ranks, start at the top, work all the way down. Like, give me, like, the the nitty gritty. I'm an SDR sitting in the seat. How am I how am I consuming this? Yeah. That's exactly right. So you've got your stack rank list. You start from the top. With each, you're gonna go into that contact, and you're gonna be provided right out of the gate, not just the contact and the title. You're getting background context on the company, on the person. You're getting a proposed, set of topics that are gonna be potentially ones that resonate. So one thing we've seen is, you know, we have CISOs, and they have different areas of interest. So different elements of our value prop resonate with different people. So what we then do is we present that SDR with two or three bullet points to say, here are some of the hot topics and ways you might talk about our value prop that we think based on what we know about this person will resonate with this buyer. So we're sort of taking this knowledge base of everything we know about what works at Vanta and spoon feeding them the focus areas so they don't have to think about how to customize. They're writing some language. They're making it feel more human. They're trying to be a a real person in that outreach, but they're being given all the raw materials. And then, you know, from there, it's just about the, following the playbook and getting better and better about what makes it human and personal. And they're getting that payload every single day. Like, here's Thursday's list. Here's Friday's list. Here's Monday's list. Yep. That's right. Wow. And what does that look like? Is it you have one field for all of these key inputs where it's, like, two value points company info, or is it, like, a long form doc that's being generated by, like, the Clay and ChatGPT integration? Like, how what what am I actually seeing as an SDR? It's evolved. So it started as a long form doc. That is that was the first thing we delivered. And, you know, what we learned in that process was that was great, but it still required too much analysis, and it really didn't have to be that complex. If anything, we have sought to make it simpler. So now we're giving you, like, maybe a few sentences about the person and then the bullet points of here are some areas of focus that we think will resonate. And those areas of focus, it's a combination of, our value prop and messaging with data points we have been able to collect about both the person and the company. So we're pulling that all together and giving them, like, the bullet point template of a message that we think will land with that buyer. How many contacts do they get a day? It varies a lot by segment, and this is actually something we're experimenting with right now. So, for example, we sell to start ups. The the contact list there are much, much longer because the the use case is much more common. Upmarket with our CSO buyers, that use case varies a ton. And, like, the the uniqueness of each situation is so extreme. So we're giving them a much shorter hit list. So it really depends on complexity. I'm assuming that once they get these bullet points and stuff, they're putting people into a sequence, a series of steps that you have perfected. They're not just writing one off emails, and then the system is bringing it back. You're letting Outreach or whatever kinda manage the workflow, but the entry point, you're giving all the information. And then, I guess, each time they need to make a call or something, that information is there for them to use too. That's correct. Yeah. And in fact, we are very focused on the phone. So we are finding that cold calling works. It is very, very effective for us. You know, historically, Manta was a when you know, even just like two years ago, basically a 100% inbound business, and a 100% of that pipeline was coming from things like search engine marketing. And as we have pushed down this path of doing outbound and particularly cold calling, the cost of those leads is about 25% the cost of those marketing leads. And not only are they cheaper, they convert better. So we're just seeing that it's such an effective motion from a math standpoint. We're connecting with buyers who really have a pain point and a need. So, yeah, we're feeding them that script, but that's, I think, why we've ended up with less focus on this. Oh, let's personalize a bunch of outbound email because we find, like, this is just a lot of noise, and then you get so focused on the activity metrics, and it's a distraction. Whereas if we can have some really good high quality human to human phone calls, for us, that is where the wins have been. Just point of emphasis. Stevie Case has outbound, dialed in. It converts better than inbound. I don't know if I've heard of many revenue leaders that can say that. That's amazing. It's, it's taken us a long time to get here, and it is huge credit to my team. Got a SDR leader, Willie Pearson, who came from Gong among other places. He is a killer. He has really, built an incredible one incredible team and a lot of talent. You know, a lot of the magic here is the hiring. His leadership team in our SDR org has been the real magic. Like, he has brought on some unbelievable leaders. The other contrarian thing we're doing, we're building this team in person. I am sitting in our San Francisco office. These folks are in person minimum three days a week. Their leaders are in person, and we've put them in all five of our global offices. One of the things that you talked about was this feedback loop. So alright. Now we got the right people, and we got the parameters set. We're enriching all of that. We're sending the reps a stacked rank list every single day of what to do. They're putting it into a system that you have tested or whatever, and then you got alright. Now let's see if it's working or not so we can inform all of that stuff. How like, I just think if I sent random AI generated coaching messages via Slack or email to a rep, they're just hitting delete and ignoring. How are you managing that process to make sure that reps are progressing? Or is that just, like, performance management? No. I mean, the basis of this process was very human. So I I agree. I think if we had just, like, built a coaching framework and, like, automated some emails to send the coaching, that would have failed. And in fact, in the past, I think we've tried that, and it just never landed. I think why what we're doing right now works is because we started with a very, like, sales manager centric process where my, head of sales, Elliot Goldwater, and several of his frontline managers sat down, with our enablement leader, Tara Sullivan, and we we sat down and and took this whole cohort of calls. And we started with the framework for how we thought we would score them and what we wanted to hear, and we all went through and scored the same calls. Then we sat down in a room and compared notes, and we tried to figure out where do we actually agree and where do we disagree and where did the calls kind of diverge. And we started to develop these patterns of what does a truly great call that we all agree is great, what does it look like, and how do we score it. Once we had consistency, then we turned it into a scorecard. And that scorecard, we have now automated, and that's what we're driving the feedback based on. And so but we do have this kind of set automated scoring framework, and the AI is then giving feedback against that scorecard. So it's like the humans built it, but now the AI can tell you where you missed or hit. So as an SDR, I'm kinda going in once a week. Am I getting, like, a a generated report? Am I just checking it when I want to? And I'm like, oh, shit. Like, on my opener is really sucking right now, and the AI is kinda telling me what to do to fix it, and I just go try it? It's real time on every call. So you are getting that on a daily basis in real time, and then we're driving additional inspection. Because I I do think when people are getting really frequent feedback, they tend to tune it out. So we have a human driven process with managers to review that on a weekly basis as well. So managers are sitting down and reviewing the patterns over the course of time, and then they're identifying the stack rank set of areas. Because, you know, you'll see a a specific SDR may consistently struggle with the opener or with a specific part of the call so that manager's able to pull the thread on what's consistent and where they need to improve over time and carry that thread through week to week. I just wanna underscore something that's come up a couple of times, which is you're having humans do the thinking Mhmm. And then you're using the machines. And I I think a lot of the reason that sales leaders will struggle to use AI or anyone will struggle to use AI is they'll be like, alright, Chachi Patea. Like, write me this email for this company, and it'll come back with a crappy email. And the reason is, like, you didn't feed it the right principles. It's called garbage in, garbage out. Right? Yep. And so, like, the three processes you've walked us through so far is you have your go to market engineers and your rev ops team, like, working on with the reps to understand, like, what's top priority. Like, what's this thing with the CSO? And then you're plugging in that into AI to get that information. Same thing with the personalization is, like, you're trying to understand, like, what's worth calling out? How do I attach that to what Vanta does, all that stuff? And I'm giving the reps the bullet points that then rep can go and, like, do the work. I'm not just saying, like, hey. Write me an email off of this thing. And you're doing that with the feedback as well is the only way you could have a good AI created scorecard is if all the managers on your team are scoring the same way. And this was actually probably a forcing function for you to make sure that all of your managers were coaching in the same way. So if anything, it might have made your real life coaching more consistent too because it forced these conversations. That is exactly right. And that is what we have consistently found. It's gotta be the humans doing the thinking. And this is where I think so many teens go wrong. They just think, oh, I'm gonna automate all this stuff, and it gets me all this volume. And the thing that really I think people struggle with is it does work for a little bit. Like, you probably drive some leads off of automated outbound. A lot of people do. That does not scale. You will hit a wall, and if you use that crutch of automation before you deeply understand on a human level what works and why, when you hit that wall, you're not gonna have a way out of the hole. You're gonna be starting from scratch. So I think it's a perfect way to describe it. The humans do the thinking. We use the machines to then drive that to scale and to drive consistency. So I wanna come back to this human element or the manager's job in just a second. There's one thing that I wanna double back to on just having a very call heavy culture. You talked about your team is teeing up the personalization bullet points over email so that your SDRs don't have to spend a bunch of time personalizing all that stuff. But, really, you're finding most of your results on the phone. I'm curious. If you if your team books a 100 meetings, how many of those meetings come from phone, and then how many of those come from email? That's question one. And then two, part of the compound question, like, how many emails does your team send versus how many calls do you make? If you give me a sense of, like, the the activity and results split for both calls and emails. Yeah. There's a lot of change on this front. So I I will tell you this. Today, the vast majority, and I believe we're verging on 75%, is coming from call versus email. Wow. So it is heavily phone. And now this does vary by segment again. So we're selling to very different personas in these segments. And we sell to, you know, everybody in every segment. So we've got a huge start ups team. We've got a huge upmarket team selling to CSOs. So, you know, what's been consistent is that phone is more successful in all of those segments, but the proportion and number of activities does vary a lot. So if you look at our start up segment, I will say we send a lot of emails. So we're send sending a high volume of emails versus phone calls, but we see more success proportionally with the calls. Upmarket, we're sending very few emails. So CISOs don't respond to cold email, as you can imagine. These are, like, security professionals. Like, they don't do cold email. They think it's all phishing. They just most of them don't even they filter it out of their inbox. So, like, email does not work with that buyer. So we are doing calls, and then instead of email, we're doing things like events, of course. We're doing engagement on social, so LinkedIn. And not just LinkedIn messaging. We're commenting. We're engaging as human beings. So it's a lot of the stuff that you can't you can't successfully automate that because it's too if you automate it, people can tell. You know? Want it to be so the numbers are small. So I would way rather they make very few calls and send very few messages, but we want that hit rate to be be high. So we've, for example, on calling, we focused instead on acquiring, we we bought Titan X, and that, like, four x'd our connect rate. That was the magic. So instead of wasting time dialing the phone, our our folks are on the phone, and they're having conversations and perfecting the conversation. I would love to know your most magical, coolest AI thing that you're just like, I can't wait to tell everybody about this because it's so Oh my god. So dope. Oh my gosh. There okay. There's we have a lot of these, and, oh, we've got some stuff in development I'm really excited about. But I would say that, like, one of the coolest today is that we've got this, prospecting workflow that includes this creation of these customized images that essentially give a prospect a vision of what their world could look like if they were using Vanta. So we are actually using Clay for this, and we use Clay to, like, mock up a version of our trust center, which is think of it like a public facing status page that highlights your security and compliance posture and all your documents that prove that out. People who have these trust centers, it, like, shortens their sales cycles, they get through security reviews faster. So we use Clay to do a mock up of that trust center. We, mock it up with the prospect's logo, and, like, we customize it to them. And that's actually going out as an attachment as we are sending to these folks. And we can also use those mock ups to post on social and send other in in other ways. It's a way to make it more concrete and real, and we found a lot of success with that. Stevie, we have to move to the final segment. And the final segment are the final four. So I'm gonna ask you four rapid fire leadership questions that actually have nothing to do with what we've talked about here. They're unbelievably different things, and you should answer them as quickly as you can with whatever comes to your mind. You ready? Okay. Let's go. Number one, what's your number one interview question? My number one interview question comes back to grit because this is the the this is the thing I care about the most. I love to ask people, tell me something that you had to work over a long period of time to achieve in your life. Does not have to be work related. I wanna hear about hustle and passion and commitment over the long haul. Number two, what's the number one culture killer on a sales floor? Quiet. When people aren't talking, when it's quiet, when nobody's ringing a gong, when nobody's, like, talking loudly on the phone, that's death. I mean, I know I'm in trouble when it's quiet. Yeah. Zoom end of quarter happy hours are the death of a sales floor. That's The worst. The worst. Alright. What's the number one thing you can do as a sales leader to earn your team's respect? Be honest and be vulnerable. You gotta be real. People can see through the bullshit. You just gotta like, I'm a human being. I don't know everything. This is the biggest job I've ever had. I think the more you own that and you own mistakes and you own what you're good and not good at, the more you can bring a team along. And they also then have permission to be real. And then lastly, what is the number one way that I can get promoted to become a sales leader? You know, I've said it before and I'll say it again. Do your boss's job. Understand how your boss is measured. Understand what metrics matter to them. Help them achieve their goals. And if you can understand that, you are gonna be the next most obvious person to put into leadership. Boom. Anything you want the world to know about? You know, I just feel so lucky. Like, I I think more than anything, I think that, I want people to hear that it is a real honor and a privilege to do this kind of work. You know, I've got a a crew here of SDRs on the floor today. Like, we've got dozens of people. This is the first job they have ever had at a college. It is such an incredible honor to be able to do that. It's easy to become cynical, but, like, don't lose sight that this is sort of this, like, very magical moment. It's a very magical opportunity for us and for our teams. Like, make the most of that. Steve, amazing show. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Mark. It's time for a three step recap and one thing you can do. Three step recap. Number one, first step in automating your prospecting process. Stevie talked about defining or reverse engineering your customers that are close one ing or your ideal customer profile, and then going and pulling all of that stuff using tool like Clay, for example, into your Salesforce, and then running some sort of algorithm over it to surface the best leads to your reps so that they don't have to go do all this research themselves. That's number one. Number two, from there, she's not automating all of the prospecting process, all the outreach. She's giving her reps all of the building blocks they need to do the human stuff. So that might be the three things that I saw in this account and the three ways that Vanta can help base on those things and maybe like a starter pack to start some messaging, but it's not like here's this email just like approve it and click send. From there, she's also having her teams do the things that only humans can do, which is making the cold calls and also teeing up those cold call scripts for them as well. And then lastly, number three, she's taking all of the feedback on the closed won deals, the closed lost deals, the calls, and she's feeding that back into the model. So this is like the magic meatloaf pan that keeps getting better because, like, every time you cook some meatloaf in the cast iron, like, it's seasoned a little bit more. Like, you gotta keep seasoning the pan. Right? So take the stuff that's working. Your model was out of date ten days ago when you had three deals that closed lost for a reason that aren't accounted for in your model. You gotta feed the feedback back into the model. Alrighty, folks? Mark, what's one thing that people can do right now? They should buy cast iron meatloaf pan, call Armand, see what's up. That's first. But no. I think that one of the things that Stevie said to me that I thought was so awesome is she has kind of primary traditional ICP characteristics, but then she has this next level stuff. So what I would suggest everyone do is grab a whole bunch of your customer data, throw it into ChatGPT, and ask it, give me based on these data this dataset and all these attributes, what are the things that are most in common with x kind of customer, right, or x y or there's a list of great customers. What's in common with these list of great customers? But then take one second and do one extra prompt, which is show me nonstandard attributes that are not in this list that may affect this, and then go research and see if those are affecting things or not. I think that that will allow you to come up with stuff like these titles on a CSO's team and a tenure of CSO of this much and the CISO that, like, talks about these types of things are now part of this new school ICP and not just the old, you know, firmographic, technographic ICP definitions we're all used to. And so, folks, based on that, one thing that you can steal is we just launched our cold email course, and Jason Bay put together a series of prompts that you can plug in a chat g b t that will basically take, like, all of your pitch decks, your website, your case studies, and then you can have it say, like, okay. Based on, like, these customers that look like my ICP, can you build me out, like, a messaging matrix that, like, pulls their top priorities, their problems, etcetera? And it'll give you, like, most of what you need to, like, start writing a good email using AI to do most of that initial legwork for you. So go get a link to all those prompts in the show notes, and we will see you on the next one.
