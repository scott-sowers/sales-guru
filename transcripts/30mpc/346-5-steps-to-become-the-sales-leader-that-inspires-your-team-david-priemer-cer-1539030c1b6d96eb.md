## Transcript

Good morning, everybody. Welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. Today, we have David Preemer. He is a previous VP of sales over at Salesforce. He's been on the show a number of times, and now he is the author of who books sell the way you buy and the sales leader they need. Nick, why should people listen? This was a great episode where David surfaced five core skills of the best sales leaders and then gave extremely practical ways that you can integrate those skills into the way that you lead your team, the rhythms that you do when you run your business. And so third time David's on the show, first time leadership one. This frankly, was one of my favorite leadership episodes we've done, Armand. And three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, David. Welcome back. First time on the leadership show, we start with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. The first one is what I call the one sentence advocacy builder, which is where you go to your team and you ask them to complete this sentence. I could sell more of our products and services if right? And you just you see what they say. The idea is we have their back. We're highlighting areas for growth and improvement, ways that we can clear the path for them. We can also moderate that narrative based on a time horizon or specific focus. For example, complete the sentence. What's one thing you could do to sell more software in our new European territory this quarter if what's one thing that our marketing team could do to support us in the holiday season revenue push if? What's the if? And then you work to clear those roadblocks for them. Boom. What's number two? Number two is what I call deputizing your team. So everyone in your team gets a job. This is where we share our leadership responsibilities. So think of it almost as, like, a two column chart. In the first column, we have the role and responsibility from us as leaders. The second column is who's gonna do that over the next month or quarter. So, for example, we have one person on the team that's responsible for customer events, one person responsible for SPIS for the team, another person responsible for making sure that the forecast data is updated in in in the CRM. And the idea is we share our leadership responsibilities, drive accountability across the team. We make them accountable to each other and show them what it takes to be a good leader. We have one person responsible for takeaway number three, and I believe that's you. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. What's number three? Number three is is a little exercise I call, what are you doing differently? And the idea is to promote accountability for behavior change and growth by coming to team meetings, taking five or ten minutes, and asking your team, hey, team. What's one thing you did differently last week than you did the week before? It could be a tactical thing like, what's one way you handled this objection differently, one way you execute in the field, did better discovery. But the idea is you wanna promote accountability for ongoing change. I can pick people in advance and say, hey, Armand. Next week, I want you to share this thing that you did that was awesome that I saw on the what are you doing differently. I can set the expectation that every week, I'm just gonna be calling on three people out of the 10 people on our team to share what they did promoting accountability and, growth. David, you wrote this book where you interviewed salespeople and sales leaders about the best sales leader they worked with and identified five critical skills or attributes. Can you share what those five skills are? And then I wanna get tactical and talk about how for each one, somebody can go put that skill into practice today. Yeah. I've done this exercise hundreds of times. People say all sorts of things. You know? They pushed me. They coached me. They were transparent, honest. So I came up with this list of hundreds of items and I consolidated it into two main themes, which were they cared about me and they helped me grow. Just those two things. And when I ask people, the leaders that exemplify those kinds of behaviors, what kind of person did you show up for, you know, for them? Did you try really hard? They're like, oh my gosh, David. A 100%. I would go nuts for this leader. I would go above and beyond. And so the skills, the five skills that help us live that kind of leadership life are promoting transparency, protecting and advocating, driving accountability, coaching your team, and getting and giving feedback. Let's start with promoting transparency. Everyone says, be more transparent. It sounds great, but where are some examples where you want to be excruciatingly transparent as a sales leader? Yeah. It's funny. One of the number one things as a sales leader we lament is why can't people keep their opportunities up to date in the CRM? It's not like they don't know what to do, but a little transparency can go a long way. So there's a lot of different dimensions. Number one is if I show the team and I would actually do this with my teams. I would say, based on the CRM, here's what it says our forecast is gonna be. I'm getting up in front of the board and the executive team next week, and here's the story your data tells. I want you to know the way I'm gonna tell that story before I step in front of them. You can help me moderate that story or correct any inaccuracies. By showing people what you're gonna do with the information, it's an example of using transparency to help improve their commitment and focus to the task. Another example of transparency, but also accountability, is showing people what good looks like. If I'm transparent about what a good forecast looks like, a good set of next steps look like, what does a good stage three opportunity look like? By creating transparency, I'm helping you act with more intent and focus. So these are just some things that, you know, by promoting transparency, showing the giving the why to go with the what, I can help improve your commitment to the task. Where are some places you have to walk a careful line with being transparent? I'll give you an example. Compensation or quotas or performance management. Things where they're really dicey topics, and you might not wanna put the criteria for performance improvement plans on a public board. What's your take on the spicier topics like that? Yeah. It's funny. When I think about transparency, one of the biggest, if I can say, like, failures that I had when I was a young sales leader is that my team wanted to know what I thought on a particular topic. For example, let's say the comp plan comes out, maybe I don't like it or maybe I don't agree with it. I can give some rationale as to how people came up with that and defend it, but maybe sharing a little bit of my perspective, how I feel about it, how I might be aligned with them, a little bit more context on the other side can go a long way because your team actually does want to know what you think. And if they don't feel you're being honest, it becomes very difficult to lead them. So I say, like, transparency, you're a 100% right. It is a fine line. You don't have to explain everything. But I think if you give almost like a like a customer who's objecting to your price, oh, we love your solution, but it's too expensive, a little bit of context for how people came up with it that there was logic and reason and thought put into these things, whether it's right or wrong, and you can give your commentary, helps kinda quell the the certainty in people's minds. When you create transparency into the thought process and what you think, it makes them feel more comfortable. What does that voice over sound like? You're rolling out a new comp plan. It's the beginning of the year. You're not thrilled with it, and you know the team's not gonna be either. How do you actually voice that over to the team? What are you saying to them? Yeah. Well, it's funny. For whatever reason, why do reps think the comp plan should get richer every year and quota stay the same? Right? So, you know, the narrative is I mean, look. You know, we have investors, board members, or a public company. The expectation is we grow x percent year over year in these products, in these territories, and so on. And so the way we've created the comp plan is designed around, you know, showcasing some of this growth. Some of the incentives we put in place are aligned with the things that we're trying to do. So, for example, when I worked at Salesforce, one of the things that we had in our comp plans as leaders is we had quotas for products, not just, you know, here's your thing for the for the year. So the idea was that, you know, Marc Benioff is saying, hey. Look. We need to sell more service cloud this year, and this is how it relates to the goals and objectives of the organization and what we stated. So I think just providing transparency into, like, how those goals were set, the fact that it's actually, first of all, quite normal for for expectations to increase year over year because I find, especially with, you know, a lot of younger sales reps, might think sometimes when things get harder that things are being done to them. Meanwhile, the reality is that a quota is increased every year. We always move the bar forward every year. That's normal in any organization you go to, and so providing a little bit of that transparency and context will help reassure them. I don't know what it is about board meetings, conversations with CFOs, the fact that targets go up. I don't know why VPs of sales and CROs feel the need to put a shield around those things or not let reps know what's going on when you're talking to Marc Andreessen on the board. And you can actually turn it into a really inspiring moment for your team where it's like, look, team. We raised at this valuation, had an awesome year. And look at that. We didn't raise quotas because we were riding the gravy train. Now what's happened is the expectations have gone up, and there are two ways you can meet a bigger number. You can either hire more reps or you can produce more reps. And I believe that we have the most outstanding team in the world in front of us, and tripling the size of this team is not a way to hit that number. So instead, what that means is we're gonna add a couple reps, but we're gonna out add outstanding ones, and you guys are gonna help us find those. But what that means is we all need everyone to step up a little bit. Guess what? My quota went up too. And I don't love it, but I'm also a realist, and I realized that I would much rather have a higher quota on a non bloated team and take on a little bit more because that probably still means there's an opportunity for everyone to over attain. That was very similar to what I told the whole Pave team when we had a triple board increase. And literally, at the end of it, everyone was like, let's go. And everyone took a quota increase on the chin, and they were stoked about it. I really like what you said. One of the things I talk about in the book is kinda what you you went into there, which is role model being a follower. It's not like I'm handing down these rules from Mount Olympus. I'm like you. I object to the board and the things that need to be done, and the bar keeps moving harder. But guess what? This is what you signed up for when you joined the company. If people want an easy life, they could be a greeter at Walmart. You decided to work for this venture funded company in part because you see the upside, but also, like, you want an insight into how the business runs. Like, you wanted to see how the sausage is made. If you wanna work for a bigger company or have an easier job or, you know, you just kinda show up, punch your card, go have at it. But a lot of the organ a lot of the reps that come work here work here because they love the nuance of how decisions are made. Because one day, you might decide to be a sales leader of your own or you might wanna go start your own business. This stuff is actually gonna be quite valuable to to know. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Let's move to the next skill, protecting and advocating. Demonstrating to your team that you have their back to create a circle of safety, which should unlock higher levels of discretionary effort. How are some ways that a sales leader can actually go tactically make that skill to life? This idea of safety is a very primal feeling that we have. That if leaders we can provide for our team, we can unlock their discretionary effort. When you think about how much time people, sales reps especially, spend, you know, doing this whole dance around positioning whether forecast and their sandbagging deals, I don't wanna think that people I don't want people to think I got nothing in the, you know, in the in the tank. Like, all of that energy we spend is not selling energy. To the extent as leaders, we can clear the path for them and create this, like, circle of safety, we're gonna be in good shape. One simple example, as a leader, when I go to forecast, I just wanna know I wanna know what the number is. Right? And so now if Arman has, like, a shitty forecast, what's gonna happen is he's gonna come back and he's saying, well, you know, this is that, this is that. As a leader, I just wanna know the number. I I can't go to the board and give a number and run the business based on lies. I really wanna know what the number is, Arman. And if the number is bad, that's okay. I would rather know now so that we can step in. I can help you rather than we go, you give an inflated number, we don't hit the number, we all look bad, and then it becomes very difficult to unravel later on. So one of the ways that I can protect and advocate for you is to make it okay to say, like, Armand, I won't be I won't be angry. This is funny. Like, as a father of of of three, two teenagers and and a 12 year old, this is something I deal with all the time, which is like this fear of consequence. So if I can take the fear of consequence out of the equation and say, look, Armand, you know, Nick, when you forecast, I I want as much accuracy as possible. I I promise I won't get angry. I just wanna be in a position to help you. So just saying that is a great way to do it. Also, the tactic I shared, the one sentence advocacy builder, you know, I could complete the sentence for me. I could sell more software. I could sell more products. If I know what's holding you back, I can work and do everything within my power to clear the roadblocks for you. Because clearing your roadblocks as a leader should be my priority. Because as a leader, what got me here won't get me there. Just because I was put in this position of leadership because I was a great rep doesn't mean that if I keep just being a great rep, good things will happen. I need to learn how to clear roadblocks for my team to let them perform at their best. So, David, how do you reconcile this with, I want the reality. I wanna know where our forecast is actually gonna land, but I also want you to put some skin in the game that pushes you to hit a higher number. Do you happen to call two numbers, three numbers? Do you just say there's the forecast and the what you really want to hit number? How do you reconcile that practically? So I like the way we did it at Salesforce, which is where there was three numbers. Right? So you had your commit, which is your sign in blood. I'm not gonna get below this number. You had your best case, which is I'm not gonna go higher than this. This is if I run the board, and then I have my ML, which was, like, the most likely. You start at the beginning of the month or quarter, and those goal posts are kinda big. Every week as we forecast, I wanna see that narrowed in, narrowed in, narrowed in. I don't wanna do worse than my commit. I also don't want you to do better than your best case because that means you were sandbagging. You didn't have a handle on your business. I like the goalpost approach and narrowing it down week to week, even daily. This is why I'm firmly against two category forecasting. A lot of teams just say, commit best. And what happens is it either becomes layers of bullshit in the forecast where it's actually more than what you're gonna land at, or commit is, like, worst case scenario, the world burns down. So I have, like, a thousand dollars in the commit. And then best case is stars align, and you close a million dollars in a month. Where's the reality? For me, it was always your your first number is your lowest number. You can call it worst, commit, best. You can call it low, mid, high. You can call it commit most likely, best case, whatever it is. But the first number is the most conservative number, and this is signed in blood. And that encourages reps to put the reality out there, but then you use the middle number to coach the reps, which is what are you doing to hit that number? The other one is written in blood. That's just happening. But how are you gonna hit the middle number? Because that's between you and me, not between me and the board. Yeah. And I like the idea when coaching someone to a forecast, there should be an element of defensibility. One of the biggest challenges is, like, let's say I'm working a deal, talking to the customer, and the customer says, this could be good. It's not gonna happen now. Can we reconnect in three months? As a rep, what do you do? Do I go into the CRM and I start, like do I push that out six months or three months? In the Salesforce days, our guidance would be, unless you can defend why they're gonna actually sign three months from now, then it shouldn't be pushed out because now it's just gonna inflate our forecast. You should do one of two things. Either dead it out and set a reminder to reconnect and, you know, we'll reinvigorate the opportunity later on if it makes sense, Or keep it in the forecast, but you put it at $0 so it doesn't mess up my numbers when I'm running the deals, you know, later on. Right? So that also, Arman, has the rep put some skin in the game because now I just can't kick the can further down the street. I have to ask myself, okay. Is this actually gonna happen? And maybe it actually does make sense to dead that opportunity out and never revisit it. Sometimes when people say, oh, call me back in six months. Six months is like a million years in, you know, in the the tech world. Right? So I remember when I was a new salesperson, I did have a lot of those opportunities that were, my pipeline looked great nine months from today. Let's move to the next one. The next one is driving accountability. Talk to me about that one. I start the chapter in the book on driving accountability with a section called that damn board meeting or preparing for the board meeting. As a VP of sales at a venture funded tech company, I would get called in front of the board once a quarter went, you know, the executive team. And it's it's so much pressure because not only are they trying to judge the viability of the business and the revenue, they're judging you. They're like, is Armand a weak leader? Does he have a handle on what's going on in the business? And that's quite a lot of pressure. I always felt if my team felt that level of accountability, they would try harder, but they felt what I felt. And so there's different dimensions of accountability I talk about. One of the simple examples we kinda said off the top was, like, sharing your leadership responsibilities. So it's actually quite a a, like, a tactical thing. As a leader, if there's things that I can hand off to the team to give them a taste of what it's like to be me, that's also very powerful. Another great way to drive accountability is to have gold standards. At Salesforce, we increase the price of of the Salesforce offer for the first time in sixteen years. Keith Block was our COO. He came in. He's like, you know, the little clause that says we can increase the price whenever we want? Well, we've never done that, but we're gonna do it now. And so we want you to go out to your your customers and say, next month, the price is going up. It's never gone up before, but price is going up. There's never been a better time to buy. If you wanna lock in, get your deal done now and preserve your price and, you know, go out. And you'd think as a sales rep, that's gold. I'm always looking for a sense of urgency to compel my customers to buy. This is a real thing that I didn't come up with, you know, prices going up. The reps went out, and they executed this motion. We thought this is gonna be a tap in. What happened? Pissed off customers all over the board. Why? Because the reps were going out, and they were like, oh, there's never been a better time to buy. Like, price is going up. All the horrible sales shitty things that, like, customers expect that we're gonna do. And it came off as schlocky. And, you know, I realized, like, you know what? We we told them what to do, but never showed them a good version of that narrative sounded like. And so after I left Salesforce, I mean, VP of sales, another venture funded tech company, we had a similar thing. We had an all you can eat pricing plan. If you sign up for the ultimate package, you could deploy the solution for unlimited users across your company, which was good for most companies. But imagine now we were selling to, like, SAP and Oracle. So we're selling this little deal and we're like, holy shit. All of a sudden, everyone at SAP can use this? That doesn't make sense. So we had to sunset this ultimate package. We did the same thing. We said, hey, team. We're sunset sunsetting this package. Go out to your customers. Tell them there's never been a better time to buy. But this time, I learned from the mistake at Salesforce, and I had our VP of enterprise sales record what a good version, the gold standard of that conversation with a customer sounded like. Hey. You know, we have this board mandated price change because we were giving away too much value. The board said, hey. You have to do this. You know, we said, okay. Fine. But But we need to give our customers ample notice, so that's why we have this two month grace period. You know, if you wanna take advantage of it, you can certainly do it. And so we went out. We said to the team, do it like this. And they went out, and we had the best quarter in company history and no pissed off customers. Right? And the same thing applies. You want a good objection handle. You want a good forecast. You want a good first call deck pitch. It's very difficult for me to hold you accountable to something for which I have not set the gold standard. So do yourself and your team a favor. If you have expectations of them, next steps, forecasting, objection handles, show them what good looks like so you can hold them accountable. I love it because this is really a two part principle is it's not just driving accountability. Driving accountability is what you do after the first step. The first step is showing the gold standard. For a lot of sales leaders screw up is they'll get mad that their reps go and talk about the price increase like a used car salesman. They're like, why'd you do that? Didn't you think about it? And, sure, there are some things that you shouldn't have to spell out word for word for your reps. But a lot of times, people flip out when someone handles the competitor wrong, when they can't handle an objection, when they're not asking for business impact, when they're not multithreading, when they haven't actually taught them how to do those things. This goes back to deputizing your team. If you're releasing a price increase, doing a new discovery talk track, or struggling against a competitor, find the person best at handling that and put them in the spotlight. You don't have to do it all. Them in the spotlight, and then throw that in a Notion doc or in a Google doc, and then just hold people accountable to what Morgan Mello was doing or what Justin Solis was doing or whatever your other top reps were doing. That's how you set the example while not having to do all of this on your own. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. To the next one, coaching your team. It's it's almost like when I go to the gym, if I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing there, I just, like, you know, do a couple pumps here, a couple pumps there. I come out of the gym. I'm like, I don't know what you know, like, I didn't really do anything. And and I don't see the results, and then I'm not gonna kinda stick to it. And that's the feeling that a lot of reps have. They asked me about my forecast. We kinda talked about this deal and that. We weren't really focused on skills development. So I say not every conversation has to be about skills development. Sometimes we do then talk about career and and forecast and all that kind of stuff. But I would say, you know, number one is, like, that skill that we're focusing on with each rep in the one on one conversation should be brought to the forefront. And, you know, one of the I'd say not not the sins, but one of the things that sometimes as leaders we fall back to is we just wanna talk about deals and not about how we're we're getting better. So I'd say make time, carve out time to focus on that. Yeah. This is one thing that I learned from Mark, which is you have to separate deal review time from one on one time. You need time to inspect pipeline and go one by one by one by one by one, and then you need a completely separate time slot to check-in on the human being, coach them, help them get better at something, and do not do the double stack thing where you try to do an hour long. And it's like, we'll do 30 pipe review and 31 on one. It's sort of like pipeline reviews are this gas that will fill whatever container they're in. And so if there's a one hour block, it doesn't matter how hard you try to keep a one on one in there. Almost always, deal talk will just happen to fill up the entire gap. So I love that. Let's go to number five, getting and giving feedback. Bring us home. So one of the the people that I referenced, the great thought leaders in this chapter is Marshall Goldsmith. And we did this great study in 2008. It was called Leadership as a Contact Sport. And the idea behind it is that as people, as leaders, we don't change when our behaviors change. We change when our behaviors are seen by others, perceived by others to have changed. Right? And so we need to call attention to the growth, the opportunities for growth, And so getting feedback from our team members and showing them that we're committed just like they should be to getting better and getting this feedback is important. So I say, how do we get frequent, like, ongoing high value feedback from our team, not necessarily just about us? Like, if I came to my team every week and said, hey, team. I wanna be a good leader. Tell me why I suck and what I do to be better. That's not gonna go very well. Although I might wanna ask that once a quarter, hey. Look. What's one thing I can do to be better? But if you don't have to ask me, like, for example, operational feedback, like, do you find our forecast calls our forecast reviews are very valuable? Are team meetings valuable? Should we hold them at a different time? Do you feel like we're getting team enough support from marketing? Do you feel like the executive team is is clear on what our vision for the organization is? If I'm asking for feedback from our team frequently and they're able to contribute, they will have a greater perception that growth is happening. Right? I'll give you this example that I I talk about in the book. I had a rep at Salesforce who was a really good rep, but he had this habit, this negative habit of making antagonistic comments in team meetings. He would make these negative comments. So he had the ability to kinda rile the team up behind him, and when he got all riled up, everyone got fired up. But when he's you drop these negative comments, people would also have a mob mentality behind. And so I pulled this rep aside. Let's call him Nick for the sake of this, narrative. And I said, Nick, dude, like, I I know you wanna get promoted one day. You wanna be good at your job. And, like, you're great as a rep. But here's the thing. Like, it's very difficult for me to promote you because the rest of the team doesn't see you as a leader when you show up and you make these, like, negative disparaging comments. You you get where I'm coming from. Right, Nick? And Nick says, David, 100%. I I know I do this. I know I have to get better. Thanks for calling it out. I I I'm gonna get better. You'll see. K? Now imagine we're gonna do a play back to the future here. Like, the space time continuum breaks off into two branches. One branch, he says he wants to get better. We don't really talk about his making disparaging comments in upcoming one on ones. We meet once a week, call it for the next three months. We talk about deals and his sales skills and stuff, but we don't talk about this thing. Is he making disparaging comments in team meetings anymore? I don't know. We're not talking about it. Then three months later, he drops another, like, what the hell is up with this comp plan and the team meeting? All of a sudden, I think, like, he's he's still doing it. What the hell? Right? That's space time continuum number one. Number two is we meet one on one every week. And every week, Nick Nick says to me, David, we talked about me getting better at not making these comments in team meetings. How did I do last week? Did I make any comments? And I'm like, no. Nick, you actually did really good. Right? And every week, I'm forced to reconcile that you've gotten better and have not made those comments. Now three months pass. We're in a team meeting, you now make one of those comments. What do I think? You know what? Like, Nick was he was good for, like, for three months. Like, you know, every week he was good for three months. This is just a bump in the road. Behavior is the same. One slip up in three months. The only difference is the frequency with which you ask for feedback, and I, as the observer, reconcile that you had actually gotten better. The more frequently I get that feedback, the greater the perception the team has of growth and improvement and the more engaged they're gonna be. That's why I say getting feedback is you know, giving feedback is important, but getting feedback as a leader and closing that loop is super important. David, that is an amazing way to end the show. We have to move on to the final question, and I think I know what your answer is gonna be. But final question is this. What is one bad habit that every sales leader needs to break so that all sales teams can get a little bit better? Coaching is the number one thing we can do to improve the performance of our team. One of the things that sales leaders are most guilty of is going to these coaching conversations without a plan, without proper structure, people get better. And we know this. Actually, there was a great study that Bain did of salespeople across The US and The UK. And what did they find? Forty six percent. They said forty six percent of sales reps were willing to pay at least a dollar for an hour of their managers' time, meaning most sales reps do not find the interactions they have with their managers all that helpful. So my advice to you, talk about a lot of stuff, just have a really good game plan for coaching and those one on ones. That's gonna have the biggest impact on your performance. Folks, amazing episode. If you want to check out David's book, I will be checking it out myself. It is called The Sales Leader They Need. We'll put a link to it in the show notes. David, thank you for being an amazing three time guest, and everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Alright, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with David Premer. What do you have for your two? Alright. My first is deputize your team. What this means is if you look at the regular things that you have to do with your team, all of that shouldn't fall on you. One example, Armand, I actually learned this from you in terms of putting it into practice. When you run your Monday morning team meeting, there's usually a five minute skill builder at the end of that meeting. That's not you, the sales leader, teaching a five minute skill course. You're assigning a rep to teach something. So this lets people participate. It helps them start to step up as a leader, and it takes some of the work off of you as a leader to give you some more bandwidth. Number two is anytime you're rolling out a new narrative or initiative or messaging, you can't expect your team to get it. You need to show them the gold standard of what good looks. David shared the story where he literally had one of the executives at the company record himself giving the talk track so the reps could see, oh, this is how I should be voicing an offer. If If you're going through big organizational changes, that might mean a quota increase, a territory change, whatever it is. Stop operating in the shadows. You're having conversations with the CFO, with the board, with your VP of sales, your CRO. You have information that if your reps just knew why you were making these decisions and understood the shoes that you're in, they would honestly accept the changes. They understand why they're being rolled out. Lastly, number four, when you are forecasting, one way you can create a safe environment for your reps is make it okay to put up a goose egg in the forecast if that is the real number. You have three categories in your forecast. You have the worst case scenario, which is oftentimes the commit, and then you have the most likely, which is what you're pushing them to hit, and then you have the best case. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here? I got two things for you, folks. One, if you like what David shared, go check out his book. Let him know thirty MPC sent you and you found out about him from this show. Two, Arman, one of the biggest things I've learned from you about sales leadership that actually integrates a lot of the stuff David shared in this episode is your structure, your format for how you would run your Monday morning team meetings. I know you documented the literally minute by minute structure sections and who runs what of those meetings in one of our newsletter posts recently, and there will be a link in the show notes for people to go check that out. I got a lot out of it, and you can see a lot of what David shared, Arman putting into practice in a practical way running that Monday morning big team meeting. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
