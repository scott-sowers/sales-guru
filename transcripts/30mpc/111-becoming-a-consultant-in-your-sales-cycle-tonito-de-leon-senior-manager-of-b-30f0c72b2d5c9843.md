## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Frogg. I'm here with my co host, Nick Cegalski. And today, we have the one and only, the SDR leader over at Reprise. His name is Tonito de Leon. Nick, why should people listen? Well, if you wanna learn how to use self deprecation and throw your magic wand in the trash, this one might be one you wanna listen to. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Tonito. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Awesome. So the first one is really just using self deprecation on your calls. And it could look somewhere like, you know, you're hitting the wall when you're talking to, yeah, a specific prospect, and you're just not getting anywhere. And that's where you just go pushing the brakes, and you're like, hey. You know what? Nick, it looks like I'm doing a piss poor job explaining what we do here at Reprise. Really, the reason why I'm calling you is because a, b, and c. And so that allows you to just pivot and really just drop the walls. And that would be the first one. Beautiful. What's number two? The second one really is the assumptive close. This is something where, you know, you're having a conversation with someone on a cold call and you're really just waiting for them to engage. And most of the times, we're waiting for them to to have that light bulb moment. In all honesty, it sometimes won't happen. And that's where we could just use our curiosity to say, hey. You know what, Armand? Why don't we do this? Do you have time next week, Monday or Tuesday? There's a couple of examples where those product marketing managers that have actually created a, b, and c. I'd love to see what your thoughts are on that, and then just pause. That's my second one. Cool. Round us out. What's number three? So the third one is using inflection and using it as a strength and being able to know when you should lower your voice or where you should pick it up a little bit and then how that applies to even outbound email and how to make like, really secure that. So sometimes it can look like, you know, when you're asking questions and you're keeping that inflection high, like, hey, Nick. We would love to hear your thoughts. I have something that I wanna show you. We help customers with this, and it looks like you're asking 10 different questions really. You're really just asking that one. So, Tony, one thing that I hate is when everything that a rep says on a cold call sounds like a question. It's like Pave is a compensation management platform or 30 MPC is a sales podcast. And so maybe we pick the point at which you need to describe what you do on a cold call. What would be the wrong way to do it, and then what would be the right way to do it? Yeah. Definitely a thing. One of the biggest things that we're hearing, right, so I work for a company called Reprise. We do deep fakes, product tours for customers so that they understand what we do in a nutshell for marketing and sales. So when I'm calling someone who's, like, a product marketing manager and we're at the thick of the call where I'm trying to explain what we do, it's gonna sound something like this, what not to do. Hey, Armand. We help product marketing managers like you display what your product does and really just put it on the front of the website so that your customers can understand what you could do and increase conversion rates. The way that it sounds better would be, hey, Armand. Here's what we do. We take your product. We create a deep fake, and you can put it on the website. That way your customers knows exactly what your product does. Cool. And so you're ending on a downtown. Right? You're not asking me a question. And also, the way that you're inflecting is you're almost, like, pulling me on the same side of the table, and you're like, hey. Look. Like, here's what we do. Alright? And I'm curious, Tony. What are you using for your cold call openers in the first place on this vein? Yeah. Definitely. So the way I like to do it is just casual. I'm the transparent cold caller. So the way it'll look like would be ring, ring. Hey. Is this Armand? Armand, this is Tony. Look. We've never spoken before. I'm just hoping to catch you in a minute. The reason for my call is and that's where we just go straight in. Hey. I talked to a lot of product marketing managers, and they're hearing two different things. Right? And the first pain point is this. The second pain point is this. Just curious. Like, does any of these things come across your team at all? And it allows you to just get right into the thick of things where it's like, well, hey. Yes or no. The reason why we wanna go in and start asking questions because we just wanna know between, you know, myself and the person I'm talking, is this even relevant at all to you? Like, is this even that you're gonna spend the next five minutes chatting with me? And then if you say yes, I'll explain to you what we do, and then I have follow-up questions. But this way, you know baseline what we do, and we can both really just have a discussion. Well, what you're doing is powerful. Too many salespeople get taught in college to talk about their value proposition. And the issue with the value proposition is, like, it's kinda all about you. You should be leaning on a problem proposition. Meaning, typically, when I talk to people who are in the role that you are, this is a pain. This is something that they don't like doing. This is a struggle that they have. Because if you can solve the problem, that's infinitely more powerful than we're the leading provider of x or we have 4.9 stars on g two crowd. And so let's say that you've nailed your problem proposition. The person's like, wow. This is sort of interesting. You talk about using an assumptive close on your cold call. Can you talk me through what that looks like, how you book that meeting? The The reason why you wanna go with the sumpt of close and the example for that would be that's like you telling me. Right? Okay. Hey. Like, yeah. That sounds interesting. And I'll say, hey. Yeah. Nick. Absolutely. Well, this is the tip of your this is what you've been thinking about. Hey. Why don't we are you free Monday, Tuesday? There's two examples that I wanna show you where there's specific product marketing managers that created a version of their product, slapped it on their website, and converted a whole lot of folks. I just wanna show you, and I'd love to hear if this is what your team has been thinking about, and then just pause. Yeah. But what you're not doing there is you're not continuing to sell once the other person is excited about your thing. And this is, like, normally, we talk about that in the context of, like, closing a deal and negotiation where, like, once they're ready to buy, you stop selling and you just get the deal done. But the same goes on a cold call. Like, once they're saying, this is interesting. I would like to learn more. Stop talking about your thing. Stop throwing more to make them more eager to meet. Like, book the dang meeting, and then you can talk about those things in a focused, like, business contact setting. I wanna talk a little bit about your approach to LinkedIn prospecting. Because 99% of the sales reps that I talk to, their approach to LinkedIn prospecting is they send a connection request with a sales pitch or they what I did in the past was I literally copied my prospecting email and I sent it as an InMail, and maybe one out of every thousand people replied to me. You're doing something different on LinkedIn, and I'm curious to hear about it. What I found that's really helpful is when I connect with you and we try to create what I call the subway experience. Right? Where you're sitting down and you're in the subway, and I'm a very chatty guy, but, you know, when I'm sitting there and someone's reading the book and I'm like, hey. That's an awesome book about etcetera, etcetera. And then they go and be like, oh, really? Yeah. That's awesome. I now have that open door to be like, hey. By the way, you've got a marketing sweater. What company is that for? That's really cool. But I actually sell it to marketing folks. And it so it it just kind of brings in that normal human interaction, and you're just bringing it into LinkedIn. So one example for that would be if I connect with you, Armand, you're like, oh god. Here comes this salesperson. And I look at their LinkedIn profile. It looks like they're just coming in hot with all these, you know, press club and, like, they I'm gonna get pitched the hell out of it. Right? But I come in there and I'm like, hey, Arman. Awesome to see your team grow by 5%. You're killing it. Looking forward to connect. Right? And you're doing something, but you picked something very personable, and there's levels to that as well. And they respond back, that's where you can be like, hey. Like, curious. That's where you can just run a conversation. The place that you can go to to find that is when you go to Nick if I go to your LinkedIn page today and I go to see activity, there's two different places that I can go. On the right side, I can see all the posts that you've done, which is awesome. And then on the left side, I could see all the things that you've been interacting, things that you've been liking, the things that you're commenting on. That example that I walked through was just me maybe trying to break the ice and maybe getting them to actually, you know, submit to a meeting with me. But the other two portions would be maybe for the beginning of the actual deal where I'm just trying to get my conversations going. I'm trying to find my champion. And And so that's where I'm kind of bringing the walls down and trying to build rapport in a sense where I can go in and ask if maybe in the later pack of the, you know, the deal, I can go in and say, hey, look, Armand. I haven't heard back from a, b, and c. I know I've had built some sort of relationship with this person where they would go and say like, yeah, you might wanna go and hit up this person in procurement or you might wanna do this and that. That's what I'm looking for. And then in the end of the deal cycle, I'm a big fan of continuing the conversation with the people that I close with or I work with because they're referrals. They could introduce me to other people within their world and their network. You know, like people in marketing, product marketing managers, they have other product marketing managers that they're like, hey, this is really an awesome product or a solution or a tool. Like, meet Tony. Right? And if I built that relationship with someone, they're more than likely to introduce me to other folks. And that's why it's really just important to connect with folks on LinkedIn and keep it real. It's amazing. We talk a lot about the power of getting on a texting basis with your prospect Because the second you get somebody off of their corporate email account and you're communicating with them, like, all of the guards come down. They can say things via text or via LinkedIn DM that they might not say in a email from their company account. And so I sell to lawyers and law firms, and most of them are not texting with me, but almost all of them, I'm on, like, a LinkedIn. It's way more personal communication perspective, and it just it's a different type of conversation. You know when you can get to that, you have a much higher likelihood of getting a deal done or at least knowing what the heck is going on behind the scenes. Are you opposed to, like, also going into things like a discovery and demo? Because you've actually run a sales cycle on me before, and I think you have some killer stuff there. Yeah. So I typically like to start with the one question that just allows you to just right from the start understand why they're even there, which is like, hey, Arbod. Look. I outbound a lot of folks and not all of them wanna take the meeting as I wish they did, but just curious, like, what got you to sit down with me your day for thirty minutes? Right. And typically that kinda sets the tone of, like, what they're working on internally and what they're doing. And once we get further down in the conversation, I have my set of examples that I'm walking through. And this is really important, but if at any point our mind's like, hey, you know what? This is not gonna work because we don't have that person yet in the team. We haven't hired that enablement person or for whatever reason. That's where I'm gonna go and pivot. But when I pivot, I'm actually just gonna make sure, like, it's meaningful and with purpose. And I want it to be like, hey. Then you know what? In this case, this is actually not gonna make sense for you. Right? This is what I recommend. And that type of conversation also is applicable to the pricing conversation because people can feel that when they're like, alright. Hey. Like, this is the price. A, b, and c, and d. This is the enterprise package one, two, and three. Once you start tripping away, hey. You know what? You don't even have a Salesforce integration. I would not recommend this. Instantly, when you say something like that, someone just goes in and they're like, okay. I now have a better fix for what I'm looking for because Tony is removing certain parts of the product that I don't need. So what you're doing is you're asking them why they took the call. And then along the way, you have a couple different check boxes or use cases that you have in mind, and you're essentially crossing certain ones off almost to be like, hey, you don't need that. You don't need that. And that will build a sense of trust throughout the process. Now I'm curious. Let's say you land on a use case that you do like. For example, we would like to have an interactive tour demo on our website, but it takes way too much engineering work to actually get that stuff done. What discovery questions do you ask me from there to get past that surface level technical pain? The way I picture it would be like once you bring me the fact that you would want some sort of a product tour, that's where I go in and I think we're at a table and I'm saying, alright, Armand, let's whiteboard real quick. If you could, for example, have the technical skills to do all that, barring nothing, how would that look like? How How would it look like if you could take the features that you know sell well and what would you do? What would you create? And so now you could start telling me oh man it'll be so amazing if I can do this a b and c and d. That's where I go in and say all right well these are the things that we can't do. These are things that we can do. And these are the things that we would like to be able to work on with you. So why don't we do this? Let's take another call. I know we're just right above the thirty minute mark. And let's kind of go in and really dive deep into those different things. I want to say maybe you can pull up your website and kind of walk me through those features on our next call, and I'm now selling that next meeting. Well, what you did that's really powerful there is you asked a better version of the magic wand question. There's a question that, like, it's kind of cheesy in sales where you're like, if you, mister and missus prospect, had a magic wand and could wave and could do anything, what would you do? And it's just, like, it's kind of cheesy and it makes the prospect cringe. You asked that question, but in the context of here's the thing that we solve for you, we're like, hey. If you weren't talking to me and you had unlimited engineering resources, time, and money, like, what the heck would you build? Because oftentimes, the answer that they give you to that nuanced magic wand question is, like, what you do, and now they've almost sold themselves in a way, and you understand exactly what great is for them, and you can almost match your solution to what they described. But I wanna ask you about a pitfall to that, which is what if you ask that question and they describe something that is, like, absolutely not what you can help with? It's, like, so far in left field, you're like, oh, jeez. Like, we can't solve that at all. I value transparency, and that's where I go in really deep. And I say, hey, Nick. This makes complete sense. This is where we're able to work out of in the confines. So I try to big back the big picture. Right? It's like, got it. So this is what your creativity brought you. And I bring back so this is what you're doing today, which is right now you're using PowerPoints. You're doing hour long PowerPoints and customers are seeing pictures, not videos. They're literally seeing just like static images. Right? And I'll go, okay. Here's what we can do. And I'll walk them through what we can do and it might not get closer to their creativity because their creativity is gonna be amazing, But ours is gonna be a better version of what they're currently doing today. And so once you've got this vision where it's like, hey. You've got this problem. You can't set up your tour portal, what have you. It's a bunch of PowerPoint slides or something. Here's what it could look like, and they've agreed to that. Where do you typically take it from there? Then I wanna secure the next meeting. So for the next meeting, I start talking about here's what we're gonna do on the next call. And whether or not you're bringing an SC on the call or you're wanting to go ahead and pull up specific examples that tie into that that one use case, that's where I'll go, look. I have three different customers that created something very similar, and I'd like you to show me what that would look like and how close this would look like to what we would build with you. And if I'm bringing an SEO, that's where I would go in and sell. Okay. I'm bringing Nick. Nick's gonna walk us through how this would look like and and really what the analysis that we can do here with you. On that call, these are the things that I'd like you to to bring with, which is just an example of what your product does. And if you can send over a couple of examples just so we can do some homework and grunt work so that we can understand. Really, I'm I'm trying to make it as sticky as possible where they go into that call and they know it's not just the next step in this person's sales process. It's literally Tony investing into that next call, where if I don't show up, they lose money. They lose hours. What you're doing is you're literally whiteboarding out this journey with them, understanding what their dream state looks like, so to speak. And then on the next call, you're taking case studies of customers who have a similar desired outcome of what they would want their experience to look like, and you're basically using that as your demo. You're not using some generic demo. You're not spending all this time building a POC for them. You are using basically high fidelity versions of what actual customers have done in their tour portals as your social proof. Is that correct? Yes. That's correct. Here's the reason for why I like using case studies. Right? Is because when I'm showing them the case study, I'm having them envision that it's their product, and I'm having them put their eyes into what their customer's experience would be. And I'm saying, like, imagine if I'm one of the customers that's going into Pave today, and I'm literally browsing through your features and I'm browsing through, like, the areas that your product can help me out with. What would that look like? This is what this customer did. Right? And this is what they did. Here's some and I'm flipping through what that dynamic tour does, but I'm not over indexing on what they did as opposed to just saying, like, here's what they did. What would that look like for you? Because we mentioned it in the first call, dream state, but now I really want you to list what those things are. And these are the things that I'm gonna use as a way to be able to track what this particular champion really values as I'm sure they're gonna bring in some other person. That other person's gonna go in there and say, this is what I wanna see. But that's really what I wanna capture because now it's like, well, this is Arman's vision, and this is really what this product vision showed you in a sense. What do you do when you let's say you've had this awesome demo with Arman. Right? You met with him. Great discovery call. You showed him a a demo of how thirty minutes to president's club could be seen, like, with reprise. And then Nick comes into the sales cycle, and Nick has zero context whatsoever. And it's like another demo. And you've got Armand on the line who gets it and Nick who doesn't get it. And Nick, like, is almost throwing the call off the rails. How do you take a call where, like, someone has no context and is sort of taking things in the wrong direction? I will literally just ask, hey. Nick, I know you're just being brought into this. I'm assuming that you and Armand had a conversation. I wanna go through and walk you through an example. If you don't mind, Armand, is it alright if I just kind of walk through Nick and get him caught up to where we're at today? Some form of just paying attention to Nick and making sure that Nick knows that I value his time and there's, you know, what you wanna see in the product. Oftentimes, what we do is we just continue to steamroll past him. And it's like, that is the easiest way to lose the attention of someone at Power. The other day, I was buying software, and they had demoed to our sales ops teams three or four times. And so they jump in and they're like, awesome. The reason that you're on this call today is to run a deep dive technical demo. And so for an hour, they go into the depths of permissions and configurations. And I'm like, guys, I have no idea what the heck this tool does. And so you need to do is you need to get into that call, and you need to just ask, hey, Armond. You just joined this call. I haven't met you before. How much do you know about Pave, or how much do you know about Reprise? And that answer is gonna tell you a lot. And then from there is you need to bring them up to speed and say, these are the four things we discussed, and here are the three things that we do that solve those problems. And then here are the two things we're gonna show you today. Do you disagree? Do you agree? How do you feel about this stuff? Before you show any software. But a lot of times, people go five minutes into that first call, and then it's fifty minutes of demo, and you've lost that person from the front end. Tony, I know one of the big things at Reprise is, like, you guys end up working with a lot of champions who have to help you get to power and and sell to people who are way above the power line. Like, do you have any best practices as it relates to working with champions? Yeah. So with champions, as you mentioned before, I like to be in text communication with them. Never will I find a more faster channel to converse with with anyone that's either a champion or a buyer. Another thing that I wanted to point out is when you're getting them into to introduce, that pays dividends at the very end of the call. In that very same call with champions, we found that once they get into that office internal conversation and you're literally just there and you get to see them kind of go back and forth, I sometimes let them just do their thing. And as a champion to the maybe the person that's buying, you know, the DM and they're kind of going back and forth. Hey, here's what I think we should do. No. No. No. That's not gonna work. Keep that going. Like that's the best scene for you to do because now you're in there in the room and they trust you enough to be a consultant. And you can go in, yeah. Hey. You know, Armand, that's not gonna work. Here's what we've seen it be working well, which is one, two, and three. And then now the DM goes, yeah. That actually might work. Right? Or or vice versa. But in terms of champions, what you get them and and when you get them to actually start being live and and really just contributing to the call with their champion on their net, that I think is the most useful part. Well, Tonito, this has been a phenomenal episode. We gotta move ourselves to the last question, which is we have talked about a lot of great things salespeople should be doing. Let's talk about a shouldn't. The last question is what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that they need to stop doing because it's hurting them much more than it's helping them? It's the recap email. I used to send out a paragraph long email and I used to rip every single feature in our product and slap it on that email. Surprised they actually never read the email. I know this for a fact because I literally asked them. So that's one thing that I wouldn't do. I wouldn't go in there and make that email longer than than even just a few summary points and areas of action items. That's my recommendation. Beautiful. Tonito, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Donito de Leon include, number one, once you've identified some sort of use case or some sort of problem, now it's time to start white boarding this stuff out and say, like, hey. What would you actually want this thing to look like? That brings me to number two, which is bring it back at the end of that session to what they're doing today and how far off their current state is from their vision state. Number three. When new members are brought onto the call, do not assume that they have been brought up to speed. You must bring them up to speed, and don't just jump right into your demos. K? And then lastly, number four is going all the way back to the cold call. Use self deprecation. Whenever you screw something up, whenever someone's not happy, put it on yourself, and people will put their guards down. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here? You know what? It's our show might not be very good, Armand. I feel feel like we might not have a great sales podcast. I'm trying to self deprecate here. If you haven't rated us, there's a little thing on the podcast players where you can click a star. I like saying five stars because I like this show. You might not like it, though. If you wouldn't mind giving us a rating, it's not as much as a review, but at least gives me something to look at when I'm bored. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes of Presidents Club.
