## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to the president's club. My name is Arman Frolke, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Szygalski. And today, folks, we have one of the best sales leaders of all time, someone who's good looking, handsome, charming, charismatic, and was VP of sales at a very young age. I think he had some a little bit fluffy stuff, but we got some good tactics in there. His name is it's me. It's you, dude. You know, I thought when you became a sales leader, you lost your outbound chops, but you did not because this episode is about outbounding sales talent to build the best possible sales team that you can. We get into everything from your strategy as it relates to outbounding, the types of profiles that you looked for, how you reached out to people, the specific messaging in that outreach, how you would work your recruiters to get the best talent for you and the most number of screens so so you had the best possible pool, how you would run your intro calls, and how you would get people to become part of the team at Pave. This was the best episode I've heard on recruiting outbound sales talent. Let's get into the show. And three, two, one. Let's roll. Alright, Armand. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Number one, the best reps are never looking. And so you need to always be sourcing even if you're knocking on doors where you know the reps are not looking. So my cadence in the early stages of Pave is I would reach out to 25 to 50 reps every single week, and all of those reps would get a three step drip from me. The first message was a brief introduction of I assume that you're doing totally fine over there, but I'd love to connect, give you a sense of what we're building, and if nothing else, keep the door down the road. The second was a bubble up, and then the third was a farewell. Awesome. What's number two? Number two is send on behalf of. So a lot of times when you get to scale in an organization, you have recruiters doing outbound sourcing for you instead of doing it yourself. And you will see a massive drop off if your recruiters are sending messaging from their names instead of sending messaging from your names. So there are a series of different tools that allow you to do this. Think if you're a salesperson, think Outreach or SalesLoft or Gong engage for recruiters, where recruiters can actually send in your name. And I will typically see a 20 to 30% uptick in replies just by having recruiters send from my inbox instead of sending from their inbox. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Very nice. Round us out. What's number three? Number three is the first call. If you think you can outbound a candidate, jump on a first interview and just start grilling the shit out of them, you are horribly mistaken. You first need to understand why they jumped on the call at all. Give a mini pitch on what you're building. And then from there, use the remainder of the time to understand why they were successful and give them a chance to brag about their achievements so that at the end, you can come back and say, you know, this might be crazy, but I think you're the kind of person who could help us build this team from the ground up. You have to sell them into the interview process when you're doing outbound recruiting. So I remember when you were first building the team at pave Armand, you were slammed. You were still prospecting for the company. You were closing deals. You were building out all of the tech in the sales process, and then you also took it upon yourself to outbound for talent. And most people would say, why on earth would you do that? Why not just put up a job posting and talk to the people that apply? Talk to me about your strategy related to outbounding for talent. Yeah. And so, look, you might be a company like Gong, for example, where you have this amazing name, you're respected in the world of sales tech, everyone wants to work for you, and you get 3,000,000,000 inbound applications. But for most teams, especially early stage teams, when I was the ninth employee at Pave, no one knew who we were. And so we would still get dozens and dozens and dozens of inbound applications, but they were never good. So I would spend time taking these recruiter screens and interviewing all of these reps who are frankly, like, okay or they were, like, slightly off our ideal candidate profile. And I would spend all these hours meeting these people with these interviews that would never actually go anywhere. And the reason for that is I knew when you're building a team from scratch or when you're making your first hires, even if you're, like, a first time manager, your reputation is on the line based on the first two to three people that you hire. And chances are you're gonna have to go and find those reps. And so for me, instead of wasting all of that time taking these screens, I said, don't even give me these screens or recruiters, you take the inbound screens because, frankly, they're inbound, and they're gonna be a little bit more likely to go through a screen. And I'm gonna spend my time picking the perfect profiles that I can see in the market and trying to get them to opt into an interview process. So I presume you were going through LinkedIn, and that's who you were looking for profiles. How did you define what your ICT for a rep was? Different for every stage of company and for your sales motion. The three things that were most important for me were as follows. Number one, it was early stage, and so I wanted to match stage on stage. And so, for example, at Pave, we were early stage. I was looking for people who had worked in a growth stage environment. I was not looking for people who had worked in a super early stage environment only because oftentimes what that means is you never actually learned good habits. I'm looking for someone who's been at a hyper growth startup, has seen that rapid scale, but has also been part of a team where they taught you how to do discovery so that you can bring that speed down to the early stages because you want a little bit more autonomy. That's number one. So it's matching stage on stage. Number two is matching sales cycle to sales cycle. And so I was hiring mid market AEs. And so it was really, really important to me that I wasn't hiring someone who was doing one call closes or even if they were doing a slightly more transactional motion. For example, the first rep that I hired, her name was Morgan Mello. She's outstanding, our number one all time producer. She was doing a more transactional deal cycle, but she tested really, really well for her consultative discovery skills, which led me to believe that she was gonna scale. So that's number two. But then the number three thing is I was oftentimes looking for acceleration in their resume. And this is where you start to get a proxy for how good someone is. So I'm either looking that they've made president's club, they had a certain high attainment, or they've gotten multiple quick promotions in succession, and that tells me that they were a quick riser. Now notice industry expertise was not part of my criteria. That's a nice to have. I was selling HR tech. Frankly, I learned HR tech pretty quickly. I also sold fintech. You can learn fintech quickly. Most people overestimate industry experience. And unless you're in something that's like gov tech, you do not need industry experience in most cases. It's not easy to find those first three characteristics. If you find someone who's not in your industry, but they made club, they understand your sales cycle, and they have the right stage match, go hire them versus the person who sold FinTech, but doesn't have those things. I want to zoom in on a bit on the types of companies that these people work with. What I heard from you is you looked for folks who were at growth stage companies. And ideally, they joined when they were kind of small, sort of startup y, and were there to the point that there was some scale and there was some process and the team got bigger. So maybe somebody who joined a company at series b and was there until they hit series d. Obviously this was two or three years ago, Arman, but I'm wondering, were there specific company names where you were like, Hey, these were the types that I was looking for. Not necessarily so listeners can go go outbound people who work at those companies, but so they understand the types of companies. I'll give you an example of the upper and the lower bound. So what I would describe to people is a couple years ago, Slack went public. And I would usually say the latest that I want in AE is Slack just before IPO. Growing quickly, and they're still, like, these teams are still operating and growing. You're oftentimes getting chances to build out new teams. Oftentimes, the sales motion is launching more and more products, so you have to learn these things. It's not like you're just doing these big quarterbacking of deals like at Oracle or Salesforce or something like that. That would be the upper bound. The lower bound, frankly, frankly, a lot of people in the audience wouldn't know the names because the lower bound would be reasonably low. But my marker was, did they have a true sales leader in place? I don't mean like a rep that turned into a manager. I'm like, did they have someone who's actually a formal head of sales and a and a VP of sales, or were they reporting into a CEO or, like, a super rep player coach who's just sort of figuring it out on the fly? That usually led you to companies that were around a 100 employees, which usually had a sales team size of about eight. How many reps would you outbound at any given time? I would usually go after 25 to 50 reps per week, which ends up being five to 10 per day, which is not that hard. And were you keeping track of these in, like, your sales engagement platform? Did you have an Excel sheet? How did you keep track of who you were reaching out to and where they were? Yeah. So this isn't a sponsored show. We don't sell to recruiters. And so we were using a tool called Gem. There are other tools like that, but think of Gem as, like, outreach for recruiters where basically I would use sales now to filter for show me companies at this size and show me account executive with these titles and companies this employee count, funding stage, etcetera. And then I would get a list of all of those companies. And then what you can do is you can basically export all of those LinkedIn profiles into JEM and then enroll them in outbound recruiting sequences. So I was managing them the exact same way that you would normally manage your own outbound pipeline, which is I had my own mini recruiting CRM with my mini recruiting sales engagement platform. Cool. So let's talk about you said you had a three step drift. It sounds like you weren't cold calling potential talent. You weren't cold emailing. You were exclusively messaging on LinkedIn. Talk to me about what went into that messaging. So that first message, which is the, hey. I don't assume you're looking, but here's why I wanna meet. What did that actually sound like? Yeah. So I'm actually going to read off a message that I sent to an AE that led to an interview. There are three parts of the message. The first is what I notice about you. The second is why what we're doing is interesting. The third is a low friction call to action. Notice if you've listened to any of our cold email content, it sounds really similar, and it's amazing. Sales language works better than these canned recruiter pitches, which is like, welcome to the amazing company of Pave. We have great benefits, great four zero one k, amazing attainment, all this stuff. It's like, no. People wanna notice that you notice something about them, and there's something that you specifically are doing at your company that tells you that they're a fit. And then they want a low friction call to action. So it says, hey, John. My guess is you're totally crushing it over at Acme Co, but I'm giving this a shot because we have a pretty similar sales motion, and I'm hiring my fourth AE at Pave. We just raised the biggest series a all time from Andreessen Horowitz out of y Combinator, and there's big upside being part of the first five to 10 reps. Are you opposed to hearing more if nothing else to make the connection? That's it. He replied on the first one, and you know what he said? He said, appreciate you reaching out. Things have gone well at my company, but I wouldn't be opposed to a call to hear more. It sounds like you guys are doing some interesting things at Pave. And then from there, that brings me into the cell call. If he didn't reply, I would just send another note that said, any thoughts? And then if he finally didn't reply one more time, I would give them a couple of stats. So I would say, hey, John. I'm gonna assume that this isn't a fit right now. I just wanted to share a couple things about our sales org to leave behind for you just in case you end up looking. So number one, here's how many reps we have. Here is our funding. Here is our average team attainment, and here's the type of person we're looking for. If not you, is there anyone else who you know might be looking? And that would oftentimes either get me a response or get me a referral. What was the spacing from a time perspective in between each of those messages? Yeah. Very similar to the first couple steps in an outbound drip. It was usually day one, day three, and then I would usually wait for it to jump to the next week, three or four more days, and that would usually be day six or seven. And so if you think of how that hits someone, I would send them a message on Tuesday. I would bubble it up on Thursday or Friday, and then I would send them the breakup on Wednesday the following week. There's a chance that I caught them out of office for a two week vacation. If they were on a two week vacation, they probably shouldn't join a start up anyways. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. So when you were outbounding, oftentimes, the first impression that these people would have of Pave would be you and your LinkedIn profile. And you're already doing a good thing with your messaging, but I'm wondering, was there like anything in particular you did with optimizing your LinkedIn profile? So when the AE saw it, they were like, I probably want to work for this guy. The major things that I would do is there are things that a recruiter would normally send inside of a message like we have amazing benefits. This is the type of team we're trying to build. Seven bullets on that. And instead, I actually keep that in the job description under my title of head of sales or eventually VP of sales at Pave. So for example, I would send a simple three by three message of notice this about you. Very short sentence on what we're building. Are you open to hearing more? But then if they clicked on my profile and they looked at my Pave job description, I would usually have a longer description, which is my goal is to build a world class sales team at Pave. We currently have three AEs, and we're growing to eight. Here's what we're all about. Boom, boom, boom, and boom. And we would often talk about things like we're building a team of reps who know how to sell in a way that doesn't feel like selling. We're operating with the mindset of three grade AEs outperform 10 okay ones. And so I'd have these little selling points that were inside of my own mini landing page, but I wasn't sending all of that in the outbound email. I would wait for them to click on my profile. I think it also helps that I was at thirty minutes to president's club, and I had a brand from there. But the reality, folks, is 30 was at a much younger phase when I first started at Pave. And also, I was at a pretty big disadvantage because I was again, literally the ninth employee at pave. No one had heard of our company at all. So nobody had heard of pave then, but you took the team from a 100 ks of ARR to 13,000,000 of ARR in just about two years. And so the team got much, much bigger and things started to scale to the point where you had recruiters who were doing outbound. Talk to me about how you worked those recruiters to help you still get really great talent. I have two types of SDRs. I have SDRs that find deals and I have SDRs that find people. Recruiters are my SDRs that find people. So what I did is I pushed really, really hard to get a dedicated sourcer for the go to market function because I knew how to work outbounders better than the engineering team would. And I was like, I want someone all to my own that I can have and put on, like, an outbound metric quota to go find people. And so there's this girl. Her name was Olivia. She's awesome. She's actually an SDR at Rippling right now because she was such a good sourcer. And I put Olivia on a quota. It wasn't a number quota. It was a stake quota. And so what I said is, you need to reach out to this many people per week. And it was, like, 25 to 50 candidates per day or something like that. And then eventually that ramped up to 200 people per week, and she started getting really, really good at this thing. She started booking, like, five screens a week. And so what I said is I gave her a quarterly number. It's five screens per week that gets you to 25 screens per month that gets you to about 75 in a quarter. I was like, if you hit 75 screens in a quarter, I'm gonna bring you to a Wagyu steakhouse with you and your best friend on the recruiting team. And she every single week, she was like counting the numbers. She was like, this is 10 screens, this is 15 screens, this is 30 screens, I'm on my way to the stake. Right? And so what I was doing is I was managing both the inputs and the outputs versus what a lot of other people do, is they just sit in the chair and they assume that the recruiters are gonna operate their function like a sales function. But the reality is there's usually not the same level of discipline and rigor in all other recruiting functions. A lot of recruiters just, like, sit on inbound. They screen the resumes and lever in Greenhouse, and they're just like, oh, could you reach out to your network? Can we throw a sourcing jam or whatever? And nothing actually happens from it. That's how you actually get your recruiters to work is you make them do the outbound. And I had them sending the exact same three step drip from my inbox. And so that's the first thing that you do to work recruiters. The second thing you do to work recruiters when you start to get to a bigger team is this was a hidden secret. So I hired, I would say, 25 to 33% of my team from sourcing jams. So what we would do is I wouldn't just go in the team meeting and be like, if anyone has a referral to a grade AE, please let me know. Because nine times out of 10, you get nothing. What I would do, again, I'm pretty direct. I would put my team in a room over lunch and I'd be like, hey, it's sixty minutes long. You gotta sit here for the full sixty minutes. You get to leave if you put 10 people on the spreadsheet. Put 10 people that you know whether or not they're looking in the spreadsheet and you need proof that you've sent them the first message before you leave this room. Otherwise, you're staying in the room. And times eight AEs led to 80 warm referrals, led to one way better candidate quality, and to a much higher conversion. I I'd like more interviews than I could possibly know what to do with by the sourcing jams and the outbound sourcers. There's one other type of recruiter, which would be a recruiting agency. It sounds like you were working with in house recruiters. What's your take on agencies and how you might work with them? So agencies are they're they're, like, really hit or miss. So they're I won't name which agencies are good ones and bad ones, but, there are some bad ones. And you'll notice the bad ones are just shilling you these, like, weird off industry, like, reps who didn't do well or they have these janky profiles or whatever it is, and you need to cut those as soon as humanly possible. So when you're vetting sourcers or when you're vetting outsourced agencies, I always say, here's my profile before we even engage. Please send me 10 example profiles of people you think would fit our mold that you're either in touch with or that you would reach out to. And if they can't follow those basic instructions to me, you're not even listening and you and I are speaking completely different languages. Once you find a good sourcer, you have to understand that those sourcers are oftentimes incentivized to work with the clients who are loosest on their hiring guidelines. So the way these agencies are paid is they're paid to fill a role. And so if you're really, really, really difficult with them or if you make it clear that you have a super, super high bar, they're oftentimes going to, like, loosen the gas. They're gonna stop sending you candidates. They're just gonna stop paying attention to you. So the same way you work your recruiters, I would do a weekly stand up with my internal recruiters. I would do a weekly stand up with my external recruiters as well. I wouldn't lower my bar, but I would squeeze them and I would say, like, look. We're gonna cancel this retainer if you can't get me three to five qualified candidates per week. The other thing that I find is that size was, like, 50% larger than it actually was. It was It was actually a 20 k deal size, but it says 50 to a 100 k. And their attainment always says it was, like, a 110, a 125%. But if you back channel them, it's usually 70 to 80%. And so whenever you're getting candidates from agencies, you have to backchannel them because your recruiters on your internal team are incentivized to help you make the right hire because they're part of your company. Your recruiters on the agency side are incentivized to get you to hire a candidate and actually hide mistakes with those candidates. How do you back channel a candidate? So just to preface this, folks, I know a lot of people might get uneasy when we talk about the topic of back channeling, But the unfortunate reality is we are in the business of sales, and salespeople are really good at talking. Salespeople are also really good at lying, the bad ones. If you've run an ethical sales process or an ethical recruiting process, you have nothing to worry about. If things are coming up in the back channel, then that means you were just lying in the interview process because I'm never asking questions in a back channel interview that I didn't ask you first. I'm just triangulating the truth. So when I'm trying to back channel someone, the first thing I'll do is I'll go to their LinkedIn and I'll look at all of my first degree connections. And if I can find someone, ideally, I have at least two back channels per person. And if you think this sounds like a lot, for executive hires, we would typically do a minimum of five back channels, usually 10 back channels. 10 back channels. Cross functional. Like leaders, reps, like, all around. So that's number one, first degree connections. But then number two, oftentimes, you won't have first degree connections. And so you have to connect with everyone at your company, not only because it makes your sourcing efforts easier, but it makes your back channel efforts easier. And so what would happen is Matt, our CEO, would always be back channeling other executives, and he would oftentimes ping me for a VP of customer success that I was connected to. And he would be like, hey. You know this person that knows this VP of customer success. Armand, could you ask this second degree connection to jump on a call with the CEO of Pave, me. And so you have to use your network to do back channels. And, folks, I know it sounds like a lot of work. It is way more work to unwind a bad hire. So do the back channeling upfront. And and the last thing is where does this actually happen in the interview process? I always do this right before offer. So I really, really, really try not to backchannel until I'm certain that the person is actually willing to make the move with us and we're ready to give them an offer. And I also never ever ever ever back channel at their company. I always try to back channel at another company that they were at. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes.

Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Okay. So let's talk about you've got an interview scheduled. It's an outbound sourced interview. Your messaging even was, hey. I assume you're crushing it. My guess is you're not looking. How are you running that intro meeting with a prospective candidate? Yeah. So inbound interviews are completely different. You can do the intro, the mini pitch, and you can basically just start growing them. Outbound interviews, you heard my message. It was my guess is you're crushing it. You're probably not looking to leave. Are you open to chatting and just hearing what we're about? And most people will respond, I'm not looking to leave, but I'm open to connect. And so there are three or four parts of my interview. They jump on. We build rapport, all of that nonsense. I set an agenda. First thing I do is let me give you, like, a one minute spiel on what we're building at Pave just so you get a sense of, like, what we're all about, and my questions don't make zero sense at all. From there, I would frankly just, like, love to understand, like, why you took the call in the first place. And And I'd love to just understand a little bit about, like, your sales motion and what's made you successful and give you a sense of if it would even make sense for you to, like, consider something like us because you might be selling something completely different, and it might not be a fit on both ways. So does that sound good to you? Right? And so from there, what I do is, again, to recap three parts of that part. Number one, the mini pitch. Number two, why did you take the call? And number three, like, just get a high level sense of, like, how you're selling, what you're selling today, and what's made successful. And that's when I give them the opportunity to brag about themselves. So I'll pause there. What did your mini pitch, that one minute spiel sound like? So the three things that would go into my mini pitch were, number one, why pave? Number two, why this team? And then number three, why you? So the why Pave, I would usually say things like, look, man, I wasn't looking to leave either, but I actually got poached from my old company, which was doing really well to Pave. And the reason for that is, like, there are a few startups like Pave that have raised monster rounds like this that are growing this quickly that are also willing to give a VP of sales like me who's recently young, like, complete reigns to build a sales org that is not bloated like every other team. And so here are some mantras around, like, how we've built this team. And that's when I get into the, like, like, we have a group of folks who's really tight. They're lean, elite team of reps. They could be a team of 10, but we're a team of four. And one of our mantras is we learn how to sell in a way that doesn't feel like selling. And that's part of the reason that I reached out to you is I find that usually reps at that growth stage at your company over there, it seems like you've done well. It seems like you've gotten promoted quickly. And usually, those are the types of people who are not only really good reps, but they're the types of folks who who are the builders, and they're not part of this old enterprise sales guard where they feel that they need to create these adversarial relationships with their prospects. And so that's what I thought I was getting when I reached out to you. But I'm curious, like, why did you take the call? And so that's a little bit old, but those are the three parts of my pitch. Why company? Why Pave? And then why you? What were some common responses you would get for why they took the call? I'm sure there was a whole spectrum of being like, hey, I wasn't really looking to leave, but, like, now that I think about it more, I am ready for a new challenge. And then there are also people who are maybe a little bit more stonewall y where they were like, just good to make connections. You'll get, that's actually the two buckets they're split into. The first bucket is the people are like, yeah, just connect, see what's out there. The second bucket are folks who they'll give you some hints where they'll be like, yeah. You know, thing things are going well, but I'm coming up on three years. And I'm I I feel like I'm not growing as much, or I feel like I might wanna go into a more complex sales cycle. Or I was I was thinking about getting a little bit more autonomy or going to the early stage, or I was thinking about a place where I might be able to grow into a manager role a little bit sooner. So if you get those hints, those breadcrumbs, you gotta pull on them. And you gotta understand, like, tell me more about what your team looks like today. You wanna be a manager? Tell me about, like, why you wanna be a manager? What do you think it takes to get there and all that stuff? And now I'm in a little bit of, like, a career development conversation. If they're giving you nothing, you actually treat the same way you treat a discovery call, which is say, why did you take the call? They're like, yeah, just looking. It's like, my guess is you don't take a call with every single person who reaches out to you. I'm sure there was, like, something either about Pave or our background or my message or something you saw on my LinkedIn profile that was, like, moderately interesting. What piqued your eye? And there's always something. So get your first breadcrumbs. Do discovery on those breadcrumbs. And then I usually like to turn, and I like to disguise my interview as giving them an opportunity to gloat about themselves. And so, again, I can't really grill them because they weren't expecting a call. But I sort of need to know if they're even half decent at sales, and so I'm going to use Cunningham's law. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to tell them that they're really good, and I'm gonna blow up their ego. And I'm gonna use that as my reason to understand how you sell. And so I might say, well, Nick, look, it sounds like you wanna be a manager. And, like, there there are a ton of top opportunities to do that here. But before I get in all that stuff, I'm I'm curious, man. Like, I saw your resume. You got promoted a couple times. It looks like you made club. Like, you're you're clearly doing the right stuff over at Acme. Like, what is it that's making you one of those reps top of the board versus everyone else? Or, like, how are you selling different from everyone else? And if you'll get answers like, well, I sell value, or, you know, I I I ask the hard questions, I'll unpack them. And if they can't give me tactical answers, I'm like, you don't actually know your stuff. But you have to lean with curiosity. Like, you sell value. That sounds awesome. Like, how do you actually go about doing that? Where does that happen? Does that happen on a discovery call? Like, is it the way you ask questions? What are, like, types of questions you ask? And you'll just act curious about how they're successful. But if they can't actually explain how they're successful, then I know it's probably not the right candidate. Awesome. That's really smart. What you do is you say, hey, you're better than everybody else. Clearly. It's actually why I reached out. What sets you apart? And they think it's just a brag opportunity, but for you, you're understanding how they communicate their own self awareness. What makes them different? It's a really, really smart approach. You get to the end of the call. You know, this is somebody that you want to bring aboard the team. How do you sell them on going through the interview journey? So if I don't like them, I just say, like, awesome. I'll either tell them that it's not a fit and I'll be honest about why it is, or I'll say, like, hey. So I I'm meeting with a bunch of other people this week, and I'll do the classic. We'll be in touch, yada yada. But if it's someone that I like, I'm gonna use a line that Kevin Dorsey or Katie uses on discovery calls. Notice the parallels between sales discovery calls and recruiting discovery calls. Yeah. I'm gonna use, I think this might make sense. And so I'm gonna say, like, honestly, Nick, like, I jump on 10 of these calls a week. And nine times out of 10, I think a lot of people think I'm trying to sell them. But in reality, like, I I know the candidate's not a fit. And I think you might have just the crazy enough profile where you could help me build this team. And I think you do really, really well. And I know you said you wanted to be a manager. I also know you said you're not looking. But part of me feels like there's something here, and I'm inclined to, like, ask you if you'd even be open to considering us in a formal interview process. And so what I'm doing is I'm stroking the ego again. I'm saying, hey. You're, like, total badass. You're, like, one of the few people that I'm actually saying yes to. But I'm also pushing away. I'm saying like, hey. Like, I know you're probably not looking, but, like, would you actually give it a shot and just, like, learn a little bit more with us? And if they don't opt in at that point, then they're gone. But usually at that point, they'll opt into the interview process Yeah. If I've done a good job, and then I can turn on the grill. Armand, this has been a phenomenal episode, but we're running out of time. So I gotta move to our final question, which is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things sales leaders should be doing when they are outbounding talent. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't related to that topic. So what is one bad habit or mistake you see sales leaders making when it comes to outbounding for talent that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Evaluating outbound candidates before selling them. The number one mistake people make is they think outbound first interviews should be farmed off to the recruiters. So the recruiters jump on these calls with these outbound candidates, and they start giving them qualification questions. What are your OTE expectations? Why are you looking to leave your company? But folks, they're not looking. Or the hiring manager comes in and starts ripping them with tough sales interview questions. But again, they're not looking. And so a lot of people take the funnel approach to recruiting. They try to interview as many candidates as possible, and they lose all the good people at the top. And what they're left with is a pool of mediocre people at the bottom, or they're left with people who were never sold from the beginning. And then once you get to offer, they get a declined offer because they the person made their decision by the third round. And so instead, what I would prefer to do is I actually prefer to spend more time at the top of the funnel so that if I can find the 10 best candidates at the top of the funnel, I can get all 10 to the bottom of the funnel and have a 100% offer accept ratio. And so I had over an 80% offer accept ratio at Pave. This was an early stage company. We were not paying top of market because we were an early stage company, but I knew when we got someone that late, it was my choice, not theirs. Yeah. You invert the funnel is the way that I've heard you describe it. So, Arman, thank you for joining us. Killer episode. Alright, folks. It's time for your sixty second recap. Your two by two. Really my four takeaways from this episode. Number one, you've gotta make sure that you connect with every single person who works at your company so that you can more easily back channel the talent that you were talking to. If you're not connected with an engineer on your team and turns out they're connected with someone who can give you info about a candidate, you're missing a really good opportunity. Number two is when you are outbounding candidates, use a three step drip. Message number one is what you know about them, why you think they might wanna talk with Pave. You know they're not looking and open to having a look. Message number two is a bubble up. Message number three is, hey. Here's a bit more about the team. If it's not you, know anyone else that might be a good fit for this. So the referral ask. Takeaway number three is when you are giving that mini pitch about your company and why they should even be engaged on this call upfront, there's a three part framework. The first piece is a personal story and why being at the company is compelling for you. The next piece is a bit about your team philosophy, the type of team that you're trying to build. And then three, end with why I reached out to you in the first place, what I noticed about you that impressed me. So that's how you sell them upfront on, hey. Here's why you should engage me. And number four is when you are having an initial interview with somebody that you outbounded, you still need to suss out whether or not they're any good, but you can't do that the traditional way by grilling them with questions. Instead, point out, hey. You're one of the top performers on your team. My guess is you're doing something different. Tell me about what sets you apart from the team. What are the things you're doing different? And ask them to brag. The quality, the content of what's in there bragging will help you determine whether or not they're actually good. Alright, Armand. That's it. How can people help us out? Well, folks, if you liked what you got here, the next natural step is running the interview process. So I actually broke down my four step account executive interview process that happens after that first initial screen in one of our newsletters. And so I'm gonna put a link to that newsletter down in the show notes. I would go check that out. And folks, if you like that, it would mean the world to me if you subscribed to our newsletter. I personally write it every single week, and the first newsletter of every single month is dedicated to leadership topics like this. So folks, subscribe to the newsletter, check it out on the show notes, and we'll see you on the next one.
