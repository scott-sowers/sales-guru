## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Frogg. I'm here with my co host Nick Skalski. And today for another round two, it's a round two bonanza with a really good round two. Anthony Cesario, VP of industries and go to market solutions over at Clari. Nick, why should people listen? Arman, I'm wondering if you've ever looked at a map, specifically a map on exactly how to get to president's club. Well, if you haven't, Anthony delivers one today. Three, two, one. Map time. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at eleven x dot a I backslash thirty m p c, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, Anthony. Welcome back to the show. You know we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Yeah. Great to be back, guys. So, okay. We're gonna talk about three things today. First, is a concept I call path to plan. Right? And the idea here is if you wanna go to president's club, you need to understand what that actually looks like. Right? So we'll talk a little bit about how you can map what it's gonna take from you and what kind of results you're gonna have to produce this year and what that's gonna actually look like to get to president's club based off of what it looked like for people last year and, the makeup of your business. So we'll dive in there. The second is once you understand, what that path of plan looks like, and that might be, Hey, I need to close 300 ks deals and five fifty ks deals and twenty ten ks deals. I don't know. Once you understand what success looks like, use that to drive your top of funnel strategy. Right? So we can peel the onion back a bit on this, on how you actually decide on how many accounts of what stature you need to actually spend your calories on in order to get to the number you're trying to get to. That's going to send you to Hawaii or wherever you guys are going at the end of the year. And then the third one is all of this is kind of in service of a concept. You probably hear your salesman or just talking about calling, called being CEO of your territory or GMB, your business. You know, I think this is a critical component of that. And I think managers probably throw that around a little bit too often. The reality is, the folks who really take that seriously, not only are they mapping their path to what success is gonna look like, just like any CEO would, but they're also putting the company to work for them, just like any CEO would. Right. So how do you think about yourself as CEO of your business, but put your marketing team and your product team and your rev dev team and your B, business development team to work in a way that it's actually serving your business and helping you, win deals and helping you strategize and things like this. So, Anthony, one of the things that I always try to do with reps is give them concrete goals that they can always look towards. And so in this case, that's your path plan. I've heard a lot of things around you should always have three x your pipeline to if that's the number that you wanna get to. But how do I actually come up with those numbers so I'm not just making things up and imagining, like, how much pipeline I should actually have? Yeah. You got it. So here's what you do. First, go look at who went to president's club last year. Ideally, in your business unit, right, because it may be very different from enterprise to commercial or wherever you're at. But go look at the folks. Right? And look at their business. What what did it actually look like? And, I think a lot about revenue bands. I think about like, I like to segment the business by revenue bands, where where it's up where that's appropriate. So what I mean by that is, like, you can almost always look. And if you look at the the folks who perform at that level, you're gonna see some consistencies. You might see that they have, like, a monster deal. Maybe it was, like, a 500 k deal. Right? Everyone had one of those monsters that got the president's club. But, usually, there's, like you can take a pretty good lens and see, alright. It looks kind of like this. If I was going to get to, let's say you have 500 ks number and you want to get the 600 ks to get the president's club, you could probably pretty confidently say, all right, well, you know, I think it's going to be 200 ks deals, you know, $8.50 ks deals, X 25 ks deals, whatever, and, and feel pretty good that like, okay, this is probably what president's club looks like for me. Right. And so you take that and that becomes your target. Right. And then what you, what you do is you back into that to say, alright. If I know I need 200 k deals, how many opportunities do I need to create if I wanna close two? And that's where, you know, you become a student of the art and the science of sales. And for all of us now with so much data and tech and things like that out there, if you're not thinking about the science part of sales and you're just thinking about the art, you're gonna be left behind because I promise you that's where the future is going. So start looking at the data and you can figure out, okay, what is either, there's two metrics that matter. There's pipeline coverage ratio and there's conversion rates. So the same thing just flipped equation. Right? So if you have three x pipeline coverage ratio, you know, and that's how your team typically performs, that means you need three times as much pipeline as you're gonna close. Right? Pretty simple. So you want two deals at a 100 ks? Pretty easy. You should go have find six opportunities at a 100 ks if you wanna close two of them. And then what what I like to do is I take that up another level for my prospecting strategy and say, alright. If I want six deals, you know, that are worth a 100 k, then I just use that same, like, three x or whatever the the rate is and and say, okay. That means I need to go find 18 companies to target. Like, who are my 18 companies that are gonna that I could go sell a 100 k solution to? And the other part of that equation is understanding what a 100 k solution looks like for you. Right? What is the product makeup? What is the type of company? Right. How, like, what does that actually look like? And you might find out holy smokes. There aren't 18 accounts in my business that, that I can do a 100 ks and that's gonna allow you to pivot your strategy and say, okay, cool. I'm gonna have to double down on the 50 ks deals or whatever. So it's that kind of back into approach by saying, what does success look like? How does the team typically perform? And then using that to drive kinda your your top of funnel strategy, Armand. And so let's say that we've come up with a goal of, for example, I need to go find those 18 deals. One thing you talked about is I need to get everyone in the company on my side. And I say, Anthony, great. Here's your territory. Go work your territory. Where do I even start in that process? Yeah. So, you know, one one of the ways you get everyone working on your side as a rep is showing that you're thinking about someone other than just yourself. And so like one thing, I, I used to do as a rep and I have my team, my reps do every, every single Q1 QBR, QPP as we call them. We'll literally write a letter to our shareholders as a rep. It may sound something like, you know, we're super excited about the progress we made, in FY twenty two. We had massive growth in the, in the Western Region in this product line. Thanks to the great work done by Armand and team. Their focus was on going further upmarket in the 100 ks plus deals. And, they've mapped the path to those deals and executed on that plan. As we go into next year, we're gonna go even further upmarket in the 500 ks deals or whatever. But that that's kinda like maybe what that letter sounds like. And when you start off, like, your QBR and you share that with everyone saying, hey. This is what success looks like for the year. Everyone starts taking you really seriously that you're thinking much bigger than just yourself. And what that allows you to do is, you know, again, back as CEO of your territory, it gives you the right now to start acting like CEO. Right? And you could start asking things of other teams. Right? So if you know you wanna go further upmarket, and now you can go maybe to your, you know, to your ABM teams, your marketing marketing folks and say, Hey, I wanna go target some bigger accounts. Can we do a targeted ABM strategy to go after these accounts? Can we partner on this? Right? And boom. Now they're excited and what you know, wanna work with you on that. You might go to your rev dev team and say, you know, your your your BDRs and say, hey. Here's the plan. Here's the type of accounts we have to go after. How do we divide and conquer? Right? Let's, you know, mutually go after this plan. You might go to your executive team and say, Hey, I'm planning on going after the biggest deals in the quarter or whatever. Here's how many I need. Here's my 18 accounts. We'd love to see if you have any relationships. Am I okay to bring you in to tell our company's story and these bigger accounts. Right. And when you do that and when you go show them that you're thinking strategically about your business like this, people wanna go to work for you. And all of a sudden, you're gonna have the whole company working on your behalf. For those who don't know, I just started a new job. And I like what you're talking about where you're talking about getting marketing to start doing ABM stuff for you and getting the exec to exec connection to break into an account. But I'm thinking about all the other roles that I've been introduced to recently, like my solutions engineers and the other salespeople and customer success and product. And if possible, I'd like them to help me hit my number two. So I guess I'm curious if I were to go to those people, are there things that you would recommend that I try to involve them in? That's an exercise that I recommend you go through Nick. That business plan is one, it's going to have that path to plan that we already talked about, right? How do we, what does success look like? How do you get to your number? All that kind of stuff. But two, it's going to have a map of who were all the other, stakeholders in the company, the other groups, and how are we going to one partner with these teams, but how are we going to leverage these teams to accelerate our business plan? Right? And when you when you just write it down on paper and you look at all the different teams, you can almost come up with something for every one of them. Like, I literally go all the way down to, like, HR and recruiting and talent and engineering, And I force myself to think about what can the what can this team do to help us go achieve this this outcome that we need to achieve as a company? And it's it's it's interesting. Like, you'd be surprised, like, recruiting, like our our HR team. I can't tell you how many introductions I've gotten into accounts for my recruiting team. Think about how many people your recruiters talk to across different companies. Right? They they have so many connections. Right? So I bring my recruiters and my HR business partners into the fold, into my business and I really treat them as business partners. And, and we invite them to our QVPS. We invite them to our team meetings and I can't tell you how many times they raise their hand. They're like, oh, I know someone's over there. I know the recruiter over there. I know. So that's that's one just like example you would never think of. CS. Right? There's a million examples there with customer success. If you're not talking to your customer success team, you're missing a great opportunity to learn what your customers actually care about, things like this. They know where all the references are. Right? So if you're saying, hey. I wanna go after, you know, these 18 accounts and, you know, maybe three of them are are of a certain type or something, go to CS and say, hey. What do we learn from companies like this in the past? Who are our best advocates in the customer base in these types of companies? Right. They have, they know where all the bodies are buried and, and they can help you. So those are two examples. You could go through that same process with products, with product marketing, with engineering. And I promise you'll almost always find some way that these teams can, can help. And at Clari, one thing we do is we, we have something called shark week, where going back to your idea of like intros, we'll get everyone on the phone at the same time together and we'll pick one rep and we'll say, the, the rep will pull up, you know, a couple of accounts and everyone on the call, like 50 plus people will go into their LinkedIn and look for connections in these couple of accounts that, that we said were most important, from our executive team all the way down. And, like, it's crazy. Shark Week goes nuts. We we generate so much pipeline out of that, and it's a lot of fun. Oh, that's awesome. So one thing I'm really curious about, Anthony, is I used to work at a company where I had a bag of, like, six different products. And to your point earlier, I wanted to hit president's club. And five of the products, like, they weren't really great, but one of them was a super easy sale with a really high ACV. And so I almost exclusively focused on that. Like, if I got a Bluebird for one of the other products, sure, I'd sell it. But I focused 90% of my efforts on just selling one of those five or six products. And I'm curious, Have you seen other people take an unconventional approach like that to hit their number? Yeah. So, this is this is a really good and interesting question. I'll give you an example. Right? So, you know, I'm building our verticals business right now. Right? We're going into new industries, serving new personas, new business models. So if my rep were to come in and only sell, you know, the product that's been really successful in the past, right, we might not get to our number because we have to think new in creative ways. So going back to CEO of your business a little bit, you know, the first lens I would think about is, like, if you look at what's important to the company right now, I would imagine the company doesn't want you selling just one product. There's probably some other ones that are important that that they need to build out. So I would almost challenge yourself to build that into your CEO plan and say, okay. If, you know, ramping the product two and product three are are important things for the company, how do I build that into my plan? And and maybe what you end up doing is coming up with some really creative packaging or strategies where you're gonna serve them with the product that you know is easier to sell. But, you know, again, you can go back to your team and say, hey, we're gonna sell these ones that aren't selling. Maybe here's some ideas on on packaging. Can I get this approved if I priced it this way or things? And, you know, you you might get some leverage there internally. But one yeah. I would recommend, having a couple past to your number. You might say, okay. If I'm only gonna sell this one product, here's what it would look like to get there. But if I could get creative and bundle things, it'll actually up my ACV a bit. And if I'm willing to to get creative with the packaging, maybe I could do it down this path. And I would challenge you to try to go down that path if that's the right thing for the company. And again, it'll probably serve you well. I started my sales career doing that same thing. The first sales team I got asked to be a part of was I was at a company called Talaio and we sold recruiting. That was the easy sell. We also had like performance management and talent management, but SuccessFactors was, like, the big company out there. And half my team had come from SuccessFactors so they knew how good their product was, so they didn't wanna sell against them. And I I had plausible deniability. I didn't know what I didn't know. So I just went in and sold the whole entire suite in every deal that I did. And I closed more business than anybody, more suite deals than anybody without really, like, worrying about it. And I I kinda tried to push myself down that pathway. My whole career as a sales rep was if I can sell the package deal, the suite deal, I always tried to do that because I knew that was the right thing for the company, and it was gonna challenge me as well. Can we talk a little bit more about that? Because we spend almost no time on this show talking about bundling and packaging, and I think it's a really interesting way to bump up the average deal size. The very best very best reps I know are masters of this. Masters of it. This is how they get the biggest deals done. This is how they get deals done, period, that looks small. It's it's around creative packaging and pricing. And, again, especially when when you're in smaller start ups, it it's great because you probably have a little bit more flexibility than you might even realize in in some of this stuff. Even in big companies, like, you know, we drove bottoms up change when I was at Oracle around packaging in order to go serve a market that was important for us to serve. So, yeah, market that was important for us to serve. So yeah. I mean, when when you think about packaging and pricing, there's there's bundling that you can do. Right? That's that's one. That's one element. And then there's pricing strategies, right, where, you know, there might be ramps that you can do. Right? Like, you know, year one, year two, year three, there might be phasing in products out years into the packaging. Right. Where, like, they might not be confident in this product now, but they'd be okay with it in six months or twelve months or something. So, like, when you start to realize some of those levers, timing, quantity, bundling, and then put your creativity hat on, you might come up with some really interesting solutions, that, again, will drive higher ACV, maybe multiyear deals when you weren't even planning on doing a multiyear deal, things like that. So one thing that I always find is sort of case by case is how do I go about making that initial quote? And what I mean by that is there are usually so many different levers I can pull. There's price. There's number of seats. There's the different features in the package, and then there's also the term. So are you typically just giving them one thing at the beginning? Are you given them multiple options? How do I approach packaging my deal on that first step forward? Yeah. I think this is where you really have to, one, fight the urge to give pricing or packaging too early and listen to the customer and what's important to them. Right? And so if you can try to, if you can try to build the package around what you're hearing from them, that's ideal. Right. So what companies are starting to do is structure their, their actual products around this to say, all right, things that are like, medium Melissa pay, medium value, put that in, in the platform, Right? Like, that becomes a platform fee. The things that are high willingness to pay, high value, that becomes usage based where, like, hey. We wanna be charging them. If they're willing to pay for it and it's high value, let's charge them for as much as they're using it. Right? And then stuff that's, low willingness to pay, high value, those become add ons. Right? So you you go do those as bolt ons later. And anything that's in the bottom left, you shouldn't be doing. You should not sell that stuff. And so the way that you package it, you might say, hey. You know, I'm gonna do product a, b, and c for you, and I'm doing these two at this really discounted rate, but you're gonna get a lot of value out of them in twelve months. So, like, I wanna make sure you have them and you start building momentum on them. So I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna put these at a lower price, but I'm gonna bundle them all together. And here's what it would've cost you if you would've buy them two years you know, a year from now. And so, like, just that kinda, you know, creative creative storytelling. But then, yeah, what I'd encourage you to do is start with the levers that are the highest yield leverages for you and your path to president's club. Right? And our reps, the the the, you know, the they'll tell customers hard stop. Like, nope. You know, can't go a penny below this average contract value over three years, but we can get creative to get to that average contract value. Maybe you have budget constraints in year one, but you know you won't have it in the out years. Like, let's structure this in a creative way to to meet your budget parameters, but we're gonna ramp up. You know, you're gonna have to go get funding in years two and years three, but you've got a whole year to get ahead of that with your CFO. So, like, have that conversation now, and we'll you know, like, that's the kind of stuff you can do. Think about the highest leverages for you first and then back into, you know, go back down the hill from there. Anthony, you said something earlier that I wanna ask you about. I'm understanding this idea of when I sell multiple products and there's, like, 80 different levers involved with giving a quote or getting a deal done, I need to fully understand their situation, like you said, and resist the urge to give pricing too early. Sometimes we have people who come on the show and they say, hey, you should be getting to pricing right away. You don't wanna hide that stuff anymore because it's gonna frustrate the buyer. And so I'm curious, can you talk about when you deliver pricing, like your strategy and intent, and I guess, how you reconcile wanting to put together a full package with not wanting to hide pricing from the customer. I hate when customers ask for pricing, and we don't say anything. I think it's rude. So what I do is I have a range. But, you know, it's it's gonna be somewhere between, you know, 100 k and, you know, 250 k. And I know that's kind of broad, but we don't know enough to to to really raise around on where that's gonna land for you. And here's some of the things that we're gonna, you know, work to get through through together to to figure out what the right package is. And, you know, there's a lot of levers there that, but, yeah, it's, you know, if it's gonna if a 100 k is, or if 250 k is too much, like, I wouldn't get too scared away, but let's talk about it. You know, know, if a 100 is too much, we should probably talk. And the nice thing that giving a range does for you is it gives them a chance to react, where they might say, 250? Oh my gosh. I had no idea. Like, that's the there's no chance. But, I knew it was gonna be over a 100 k. At least now you know where you stand. Right? And you can kinda, like, you know, gauge yourself on on when you do show pricing, you know, where their expectations are. By the way, when they go to pricing, they're also opening up the right for you to go to pricing. Right? So when they ask you for pricing and you and you give them some details on on how you're gonna go about it, that gives you the opportunity to flip it and say, great. Glad you're talking about pricing. So help me understand. What's the budget process look like for you? Right? It's a perfect lever to go to budget. Right? So it's like, cool. You know, is that I mean, 250 k. Let's just assume it's at the top of that range, 250 k. What what's the process gonna be like for you to secure 250 k for this budget? Right? Have you have you budgeted for it already? Is this project on the docket? Have you ever done a project like this before, right, of this magnitude? Right? If not, who, like, who can we talk to to make sure make sure we understand the process? Like, they're opening up Pandora's box on their side as well, which is where we wanna get to anyway. And so what do I do for especially for a tool like Clari, where honestly, it's probably still not budgeted all the time. You get someone who's, I don't know, a director of sales or director of sales ops. They're almost at the PowerLab, but not exactly. Right? And they're like, oh, no. Like, I just don't have budget for this thing. How do I start to coach them through that exercise so that they can go and grab some? Yeah. Well, I could tell you we're never budgeted for. So there's never this, like, I'm gonna put AI and machine learning on top of an machine learning on top of an already really expensive enterprise platform budget sitting out there somewhere. And so we start early with it. Right? We really wanna understand how does this tie to the the growth initiatives at the top of the company. Because, if it doesn't tie to one, there's a low chance that this actually gets budgeted for. So we'll wanna start there with you and understand how does this tie to, to, you know, to your strategic initiatives. That's what your executives are gonna ask too. We're probably gonna get to a point where we start talking about, like, ROI. Right? Like, what's the return on investment? Like, that's kind of de facto. You're gonna ask me that. I'm gonna ask you, how do you quantify it? How are you gonna quantify ROI? When you bring this to your CFO, is she gonna actually believe the numbers that we bring her if we spend hours and hours and hours building an ROI case study? Newsflash, the answer is probably no. So, like, we'll still go through that together. But what what's gonna actually matter more is if you can clearly articulate how this is gonna impact key growth initiatives for the company. So I would encourage us to spend a lot of time there, and we'll do the ROI stuff together. Like, that's how I had that conversation is helping them understand how decisions actually get made above their heads. And it's not with an ROI case study. You can't bring a CFO something that says, hey. You invest a $100 and you'll make 10,000,000 and they sign on the dot. They're gonna have much deeper questions like, how does this serve our business strategy in the next six months, next twelve months? Anthony, this is awesome. I've legitimately got two pages of notes, and we're running out of time. We gotta move to the final question. The final question is this. We have talked about a ton of really great things that salespeople should be doing to be CEO of their territory and make it to presidents club and hang out on the beach in Hawaii. But we've gotta move to the president's club and hang out on the beach in Hawaii. But we've gotta move to the inverse of that. I'm I'm gonna ask you about a bad habit. And so the final question is this. What is a bad habit that you see a lot of sales reps exhibiting that you think they need to break because it's hurting them more than it's helping? A lot of people are doing value case studies now, ROIs, all that kind of stuff. I yeah. I'd encourage you to, like, get more human and think about, like, how people actually buy. And it's very it's very rarely that it comes off of some, like, ROI analysis or some, like, customer testimonial that you hand them. It usually happens by way of conversations with their peers or, and or, them really feeling like they understand how it's gonna impact the business at the highest levels. And we just don't do it. Most sales reps don't do a good enough job tying their pricing and their value back to to those things. So I'd encourage you, if you're not getting really serious about your your reference strategy and, and you're not able to really clearly articulate how your product is gonna impact the the business strategy, you know, the the ROI work that you're doing, the value stories that you're telling are probably gonna fall on deaf ears by the time they actually get to the CFO or whoever has to cut the check. So, yeah, there you go. Bad habit is letting price be priced and not really thinking about the value and how people buy. Love it. Folks, if you haven't listened to Anthony's first appearance on the show, he did join us on episode 49. So go check that one out as well. It was a phenomenal episode. Anthony, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? Yeah. So, like, I'm hiring. Right? I'm building out a verticals team here at Clari. We're super excited to help companies outside of tech and SAS, you know, put predictability on revenue. So if you guys are, are interested and, you have any experience in health care and financial services and manufacturing and all these kind of cool spaces, come look me up on LinkedIn. We're building a great team. But other than that, I'll plug you guys. You guys kill it. I always say I wish I had thirty minutes to, to dad's club, a thirty minute to husband's club, a thirty minutes to manager's club, but, I'll take thirty minutes to sales club while I have it. Well, maybe one day when Arman has a kid and I have a kid and we actually know what we're doing, which I don't really suspect would ever happen, we'll have a thirty minutes to dad's club. But, Anthony, thanks for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Anthony Cesario include number one, when you get asked for ROI, don't send over case studies, don't send over all your BS numbers. Instead, put it on the customer. Ask them how you're gonna quantify it and build the business case together. Number two. When you're getting pushed for pricing, it's really awkward if you just say nothing at all. So give a big range, and an intentionally big range, and watch how they react to it. Number three. Shark Week. Get all the important people at your company in a room, and go down the list of all your key accounts, and get as many referrals as you can. And then number four, when people ask for pricing in return, you now have the ability with reciprocity to ask what their budgeting process looks like. Alright. Those are our four. Nick, how can people help us out? Well, Anthony was on this episode for around two. And so if you haven't listened to round one, you might wanna go listen to round one. It was really good. That's all I got. We'll see you all next week on thirty minutes of Presidents Club.
