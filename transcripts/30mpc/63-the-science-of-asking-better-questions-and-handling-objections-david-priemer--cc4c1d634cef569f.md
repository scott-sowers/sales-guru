## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Seagalski. And today, we have the one and only David Kramer. He's the founder of Cerebral Selling. Nick, why do the people listen? Well, Arman, you've got me thinking about you just asked me a question and you didn't give me a reason why. David talks about getting reasons for asking questions in this episode. He talks about order in which you ask your discovery questions and how that impacts the answers that you get. This was a really great episode on questions and how you can ask better ones. Three, two, one, question. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. David, welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Right on. Thanks for having me, Nick. So the first one is I talk about, as I say, pick an enemy. So one of the biggest challenges we have in sales is getting the other person, getting our customers to understand what it is we do. And we we always work up these pitches and features and benefits. And I say forget all that. Lead with your customer's enemy, the problem they're looking to solve. So if you said, hey. Look. We work with people who love feedback but hate performance reviews. Right? Like, the enemy is the performance review. You might say, look. We work with sales teams who love to buy who know customers love to buy things, but they hate talking to salespeople. So lead with the enemy. It's a much more compelling way to get your message across. Beautiful. What's number two, David? The second tip is what I call a simple reasoning phrase. So when it comes to sales discovery, the key is getting our customers to open up and share their information with us. But the problem is that a lot of the questions that we ask are contentious. We ask about what's the customer's budget or what's their timing or who's gonna sign it or what's the approval process look like. And all these things, when we ask these questions, like, think about when you get asked this question, the customer's thinking, why is this person asking this question, and what are they gonna do with that information once they give it to them? So the simple tip is share why you're asking by appending your question with the simple reasoning phrase, the reason I ask is because. So when you ask for budget, timing, who's the signer, the reason I ask is because helps the customer understand why you're asking, and it helps them frame up the answer so you get the information you're looking for. Great. What's number three? And the reason I ask is we always do three tips in the beginning. That's good. Alright. I was gonna stop at two, but I'll give you one more. I I refer to this as avoiding eye phrasing. And so what do we mean by this? So many sellers, you know, younger or newer sellers, have a hard time connecting with their ideal customers with conviction and credibility because you've never done their job. And so oftentimes when we start describing what it is that we do, we say, well, what I've found, what I've seen, what I feel, what I, you know, what I think. And I say, like, no one cares what you think. Right? You have very you have very little credibility if you're younger or newer to your role or industry or company. So I say switch your I phrasing. Don't fall into that I phrasing trap. Switch it to we phrasing. So when you talk about, well, what we found at our company, or we've been in business for ten years and what we've realized in that time, or what our customers have found is that or there was an article on Harvard Business that talked about a, b, and c. And the idea is by switching from the I phrasing to the we phrasing, you're shifting the burden of credibility from you who, let's say, doesn't have a lot to entities to which that that have a lot more credibility. Right? So you're able to communicate your value with a lot more passion and conviction even if it's your first day on the job. Bingo. The reality is is even if you're not an expert in HR tech or legal tech, you have the blessing of being able to talk to 200 people per month or whatever it might be and see how they do it. My question, David, is a lot of people talk about telling stories, and they always say you gotta talk in stories, but very few people actually break down the ingredients that make a good sales story. Could you walk us through how you think about telling stories? Yeah. Well, you know what? One of the easiest metaphors I use, and I'm a this is one of my guilty pleasures. So I think about infomercial products. I love infomercial products. I talk about infomercial products a ton in my book, and I have tons of articles and videos on my website and YouTube channel. And the idea is, like the the magic of infomercial products is you're watching the show thinking to yourself, I don't need this thing. I don't even know what this thing is. And then all of a sudden, you're like, you're dialing the +1 800 number because this thing you couldn't live without. And the formula they take you through is very simple. So they start out by highlighting, like, here's the problem, Then they talk about, well, here's the ideal solution to the problem. Then the third step is, here's why that ideal solution isn't really for you, and then they insert their product. So, like, imagine the infomercial for, like, sharp knives, like, Merkel Blade or whatever it is. Right? They're like, you wanna create, like, delicious healthy meals for your family, right? Well, you know, all you have to do is, you know, you need sharp knives to do that. What's the solution? Go to the mall. Go to fancy stores and buy sharp knives. But do you know that one knife can cost, like, dollars 500, dollars 1,000? No one has to pay that much. We believe that you should be able to feed your family and prep delicious, amazing food with affordable knives that never go dull. Right? Like, I'm taking you through, like, a little narrative. Right? You wanna get in the best shape of your life. Right? Well, the best way to do that is go to the gym and exercise for a few hours a day and eat well. The problem is gym memberships are expensive, and who has time to go? Right? I have a solution, and you don't even know when I'm pitching. But through that little five second narrative, I have you leaning in and saying, well, this is really interesting. Tell me more. And I haven't even talked about what it is I do. So I love you talk about storytelling. I love infomercial, that infomercial formula for communicating what it is you do. If I'm a b to b seller and I'm meeting with a customer for the first time, how am I incorporating that into, like, my credibility building and, like, that initial conversation that I have with a customer? Because I certainly don't wanna show up on the Zoom and then just, like, start vomiting an infomercial on my prospective buyer. Of course. Well, look. The idea behind the infomercial is I need to learn a little bit more about you so I can select the right story to kinda pull off the shelf. And one of the things I talk about when I talk about my infomercial formula, and this is gonna sound worse than it is, is I say, like, sometimes if you wanna sell someone a Band Aid, you have to cut them first. I say I I'm not suggesting you intentionally harm your customers by any stretch. What I'm saying is, you know, our customers walk around with all sorts of, like, latent pains, pains that they kinda know are there, but they're not fully in touch with. And when you watch that infomercial, they're like you say to yourself, yeah. I have that problem. For example, I'll give you, like, a great example. One of my clients is a cloud bookkeeping company. And they'll call up entrepreneurs and and folks, and they'll say like, hey. You know, we we have this, you know, bookkeeping solution. And they'll say, can I just ask you? Like, what are you doing today for bookkeeping? They'll say there's only one of three answers we hear. They're doing nothing because they don't even know that this is something they should do. Number two, they're doing something on spreadsheets. Number three, they're using QuickBooks because that's, like, the big product in the space. Once I know that, then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tell you a story that leads from where you are today. So if you're doing nothing today, I'm gonna tell you a story about, oh, yeah. I have lots of clients who do nothing, and what they tell me is a, b, and c, and here's the story. If you're coming from QuickBooks, I might say, hey. Look. I I have lots of clients that use QuickBooks. What they tell me is that the product is sometimes overkill, and the service isn't as good as what they were hoping for. Right? And so the idea is actually I refer to this as assumptive priming, which is I wanna showcase the fact, to your point, Nick, that I understand the pains that you're experiencing typically in your industry, for your role, for the place you are today. But I don't wanna just go and blast out the shotgun approach of, like, everything that I could possibly talk to you about. I wanna learn a little bit about you. And then once I know that, then I'm gonna take you down a certain path. And that's kinda where these two things marry up. Good discovery, but also showcasing to the customer that, no. No. No. Like, I I understand where you're coming from, which is really important whether you're, you know, new, old, you know, experienced or not. Like, you have to understand where the customer's coming from. I love it. Primer's priming. We'll trademark that one. It's not the first time I've heard that, but that's good. Yeah. Good deal. Oftentimes, what you see with new reps is there are two extremes with starting your first discovery call. One, I pepper you with nothing but questions for thirty minutes. Two, I talk at you for thirty minutes, and both are bad. It's always a little bit of a give and take. And so if you think of how to weave stories into your discovery process, when is the right time or what are some of the signals that I should start to listen for where I can say, okay. Let me stop peppering them with questions now and empathize and potentially tell a story. Yeah. It's a good question. You know, I actually I when when I teach messaging and pitching, like, okay, how to describe what you do, the question becomes, okay. Well, where where do I use this? In the is it just like when I'm cold calling in in the first ten seconds? They say no. Like, you can use it certainly when you're cold calling or you're cold emailing and someone says, oh, like, thirty minutes to present? What the hell do you guys do? You can bring that out. But you can also do it, for example, when a customer shares something about their business. They might say, oh, yeah. Well, we've tried deploying a solution like this before, and it it just didn't work. And I can say, oh, yeah. Look. We work with customers all the time who who love, you know, deploying solutions to help them make themselves really efficient, but they just hate how time consuming and laborious it can be. And so you you see, I just I use that to respond to a customer sentiment. A lot of my clients will actually start using messaging even at the end of the sales cycle, the end of the call when the customer says, so how much does this cost? This all sounds kind of interesting to me. Like, what are we talking about here? And what they do is they use that as an opportunity to remind the customer of their value. It's almost like, you know, when you're watching an infomercial and you're like, oh, it slices and dices, and you're like, oh, this is great. And then the host says, you're probably wondering how much they cost and where can I get them? And they and what do they do is they take a step back and they say, well, Armand, to do everything that this machine would do, it's gonna cost you you have to have a fryer and a slicer and a this and a that and an oven. And so the what they're doing is they're reminding you of why you invested in this conversation in the first place. So there's really you know, with the way I teach it, there's so many opportunities to weave these stories in throughout the discussion. You don't don't think about, like, storytelling is something you have to incorporate, like, right into your pitch at the beginning. You can use it to handle an objection when you're negotiating, to respond to a customer sentiment, to agree with them, handle an objection. I mean, it's it's all over the place. So, David, part of the way that I'm gonna formulate the story that I end up telling the the customer is stuff that I learned from them about their challenges and what the heck's going on in their world. And the way that I get that information is by asking questions. And one of the things that you put in the prep talk was the specific order in which you ask questions and why that's important. And I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about that. So the idea is when we ask questions, part of the objective of asking questions isn't just to get information back. We wanna create a bit of an emotional reaction in the mind of the customer because it's that emotional reaction that's gonna cause them to lean in and say, tell me more and and ultimately buy. If I were to, for example, ask you about your current vendor, you know, I might say, well, how happy are you with your current vendor in you know, that you're using now? And you might be like, well, there's things that we like, things that we don't. What if I asked you, how many times did you have to call your vendor for support in the last year? And if you have, like, a a negative reaction to that question, when I ask you the second question, well, how happy are you with the service you're getting from that vendor? The emotion from that first question is going to color the emotion to the second question. It's what's known as this is it's in in psychology, it's a substitution heuristic. Ask a simple question that creates an emotional reaction in the mind of the customer, followed up with the more general question. That has been shown to have, like, an off the charts emotional correlation versus the other way, no correlation at all. So to make sure I understand this right, instead of me asking how happy are you with your vendor, you say, it's alright. I mean, you cold called me, so it wasn't so bad that we had to rip it out. Right? And then if I ask you afterwards, how many times do you ask your vendors for support? You're already on defense because you've already defended your relationship with your vendor versus if I lead with, hey. How many times do you ask your vendor for support first before I ask you how happy you are with your vendor? They're more likely to bring me in the right direction. Is that correct? Correct. Yeah. They're likely much more likely to have an emotional reaction. Now, again, it's a calculated question because if they say, actually, I haven't called my vendor at all in the last year, then they're gonna have this, like, positive halo effect from the first question. So you need to you need to be mindful of, the questions that you're asking and and use calculated questions, which which is actually something that's quite consistent across so much of sales, especially when it comes to, for example, objection handling. When the customer says, oh, it's too expensive. We love hey. No. Armand, we love your product, but it's just too expensive. You know, one of the ways that, you know, we can handle that, that objection is what I refer to as consider the alternative. So I challenge the customer to say, hey. Look. You know what? Maybe this product isn't for you. And and maybe maybe you're right. Like, maybe you don't need our product. Maybe you could get away with a slightly less expensive product. What what might that look like for you? Right? Like, I I get I get you to kinda go down that road. Now I would only use that tactic per se if I believed that you were actually better off with my product because, otherwise, I'm gonna push you further into the camp of the other product. Right? So we always have to be mindful of the emotion emotional response that our questions create in the mind of our customers. What are some other examples or or common, I guess, formulas you see people using to create that that first level question before getting to the one where the person really spills their guts? Yeah. Like, the simplest thing is kind of like what I said is to kinda lean on a question that has, like, for example, like, a clear yes or no answer, maybe a numerical response, like how many times did you have to call the vendor. The answers that give kind of a numerical response first are typically the ones that that are easy for people to come up with. If you for example, if you wanna formulate one of the tactics I talk about in the book, and I talk about it a ton on my channels, is what I refer to as the one to 10 questions, which is you ask the customer, on a scale of one to ten, ten being this, one being this, where would you say you are? And And that's actually, like, kind of a good safe way because now if the customer picks, like, a really positive number for them, you could ask a different secondary question. Right? But if they pick a a a kind of a bad number that creates, like, a negative reaction, oh, yeah. Like, I'm we're probably a two out of 10 in terms of, like, this behavior that your that your vendor, you know, your product helps us drive. Then I can follow-up with something that's a little bit more, you know, kind of emotionally driven and and and qualitative. So if we go a step backwards here, I love what you're doing where we're getting into the actual problems. We're getting them to quantify the problems. But naturally, if I stepped into a discovery call and said, David, thanks for taking my call. On a scale of one to 10, how much do you whatever it might be. You'd be like, dude, you you came in a little bit too hot. And so what am I doing before that in a discovery call to get to that point? Oh, yeah. I this is amazing discussion, and this is actually a video I've been I I have on my list to make, so thank you for for asking. So one of the the problems that people have with questions in general is that to the customer, it kinda feels like a polite interrogation. Like, it was like, it was on your list of stuff to ask me, and you're just kinda plowing through the list. And when I give you the answer, you say great, and then you move on to the next thing. And the way I kinda think about questions, the best questions, they almost need to feel and seem like gifts to the customer. Like, I wasn't planning to ask this question, but you just said something. It sparked something in my mind that took me off my regular talk track. And when I do that in a deliberate way, it makes you feel like there's certain amount of, like, reciprocity. There's a certain, you know, indebtedness that you have to me because it was paying so close attention. Bonus points, by the way. And I listen to my clients' discovery calls all the time. Bonus points if you recap what like, kinda like almost like what I did, what the person said. So, Armand, I love what you said about a, b, and c. Do you mind if I ask? Like so chambering up these questions like they are gifts to the customer, like you are just thinking about them on the fly because of something the customer said, that's a super simple tip for creating that really authentic engagement. The other challenge is when we ask those questions is that sometimes we have kind of what I refer to as, like, they're leading. Right? Like, Arman, on a scale of one to ten, ten being you want your podcast and your business to be super successful, one, you don't give a crap. Like, where where would you say you are? No one's gonna say that. It's like the equivalent of the worst discovery question I've ever been asked was at a trade show where someone came to me and said, hey, sir. Do you like to save money when you shop? Right? It's a leading question, and it makes customer skin crawl. So, you know, make sure that when you're asking these questions, it it's not like you're not leading your customers into a logic trap. Whatever they should be free to answer whatever answer they feel is appropriate. But the exactly what you said, Armand, like, you're cooking the question up for them, and it needs to feel authentic like a conversation, not the polite interrogation. David, I like the piece about someone's free to answer however they want. And something I sort of struggled with as a newer salesperson was if a customer answers a question or a series of questions that, like, has made it obvious that I'm not a very good fit for what their problem is, how do I politely, like, turn them away and say, hey. We're not really a good fit. I really struggled it with it so much as a new salesperson that I ended up working deals that, like, I knew weren't gonna work. Like, I was too embarrassed to be like, I don't think we can help you. Do you have any advice for people who are struggling with that? Part of it after a certain point is you have to invoke that mindset of the healthy skeptic and just say, you know what? Like, I'm not sure if this is a a fit. I don't know if this problem is big enough. I'm just not sure. You know? Typically, the customers who are really good fit for us are the ones that a, b, and c. And you can still qualify the customer and let them come back to you because sometimes sometimes, you know, it's it's the the customer really does want your product or service, but they just don't know how to buy it. Like, I'll give you an example in, my third startup. So my third startup ended up being acquired by Salesforce. That's how I ended up working there. But my third startup, what did we do? We were a feedback coaching and recognition platform. And so oftentimes, we would get RFPs and so on from like HR departments, and they would be asking for like modern, you know, performance solutions. And we would look at these requirements, and some of the requirements were, like, old school performance review, like, once a year. And we would go back to the customer. We would say, well, hold on a second. Like, we had this whole discovery call where you said you didn't want this. Like, you wanted what we had. You wanted the more progressive, you know, ongoing coaching thing. And they said, no. No. No. We do. We do. And they we just don't know how to write the RFP essentially to ask for this. And so sometimes when we take a step back, we say, hey. Look. Based on these requirements, I don't know if we're a fit for you, and we requalify. Sometimes they come back. But sometimes, you know, we if we give them the option to say no, hey. Look. I don't know if this is a fit. Most of our clients, they typically look like this. They act like this. This is kinda what they're looking for. I'm not seeing that here. And if that's not what you're looking for, like, that's okay too. Like, we can part as friends. The last thing I wanna do is continue the dialogue when when this isn't a fit. So there really is no like, you know, you gotta put yourself in the mindset of a healthy skeptic and ask yourself, like, what will happen if I continue through the funnel, continue through the dialogue, and just take a step back and say, hey. Look. You know what? Maybe this isn't a fit. And make it the customer's decision to to withdraw from the from the process. Another time this oftentimes comes up is when you're in a head to head competitive battle. Right? And so are you using similar tactics when you come up on a competitor, or how do you generally approach competitors overall? So it's it's interesting. So there's a couple dimensions to the competitive piece. There's, like, how we lay landmines and how we position, like, what it is we do really well so the customer is really clear on what the difference is. But one of the things, actually, I did a video a little while ago recently on my YouTube channel about how to talk about your competitors. My advice is you don't necessarily wanna go, like, head to head. Like, oh, here's what they do really well. Here's what we do really well. What I've seen is this. It's almost like the eye phrasing piece that we talked about earlier. You kinda wanna stamp that out. Because who has credibility when it comes to talking about competitors? The market, your customers, you know, reviews on reputable websites. So you'd say, you know, hey. Look. You know, I I know you're probably looking at at Salesforce. You're looking at Microsoft. You know, the the feedback that we get from our clients who have tried Microsoft and have tried Salesforce, they tell us that they like Salesforce because of a, b, and c. They love a solution that's gonna grow with them. They love that there's an ecosystem and a marketplace and all that kind of stuff. But look. You know what? Microsoft is a great solution too, and that's really a great solution if you're a you're a, like, a huge Microsoft shop and you have everything kind of looped into Microsoft. Like, that can be a good solution. And and that's what our clients tell us. So what we're doing is we're giving competitive information, but we're doing it in the voice of entities that have more credibility than us. So it doesn't become like an us versus them kind of a thing. Right? Like, hey. Look. If you're trying to figure out whether you should go with me or not, like, go look at my website. Go take a look at the reviews my clients have left. Go on g two crowd. Go on TrustRadius. Like, Google our company slash reviews and tell us what you find. That would be my best advice. That way, I'm not putting the burden again of credibility onto me. Can you talk a little bit about the positioning and planting landmines, what that means, and how people can do it? Yeah. Well, it's actually kind of a combination of the things we've talked about so far. So, you know, when you're trying to, like, pick an enemy, you can start dropping enemies that are aligned with, I guess, aligned with your competitor and not so much you. So for example, let's say you have a there's a competitive solution out there that is a great solution. It's, like, infinitely configurable, and it it can be super duper customized to the customer's needs. You might say, hey. Look. You know, if you're looking for a solution that is is uber customizable and, like, you can have, like, for a million years, then that might be a a good solution for you. The downside is our our clients will tell you or they'll tell they've told us that it just takes a long time to get that thing up and running, and it takes a fair amount of time to maintain and make sure it's, you know, continuing to operate. Our solution is for organizations who want 80% of that benefit but realize that they just hate the setup and ongoing configuration process. And so you see what I'm doing here is I'm talking about third person. I'm also talking about enemies. Now the idea is if the enemy of the customer is bandwidth and setup time and configuration and ongoing maintenance, then they're gonna align with me. If they want something that's infinitely configurable, they're gonna go with the other vendor. And the other challenge is it has to be at the right time. You know, one of the the challenges a lot of salespeople fall into, one of the challenges they have is that as soon as we get a little bit of resistance from the customer or they've ghosted on us, then we immediately start with, like, the breakup emails and, like, oh, have I lost you? Do you do you not want our solution? And they're just like, no. Like, it's been it's been a week, and you emailed me twice. Like, I I was busy. You know? It's not just selecting the right tone and the tactic, but doing it in the right context with the right timing. That's why and I I couldn't agree more with Dan Pink. He talks about this in his book to sell as human, how sales is now. Not that it wasn't before, but now sales is a thinking person's profession because there is so much nuance to how people respond to your tone, your questions, your approach, especially now where there's a million solutions on the market that all do the same thing to the in the customers. You I know we're all delicate snowflakes, and we're all unique. Right? But to our customers, we all sound the same. And so the way we break out of that requires us to be very thoughtful and mindful about how we approach the tactics we use. David, this has been freaking awesome, and we're running out of time. And and so I think we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. So we've talked about a ton of really great things that salespeople can be incorporating into how they have conversations with customers, and now we gotta talk about sort of the inverse of that, which is a bad habit. So my question for you is what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to stop doing because it's hurting them more than it's helping? Closing tactics. Closing tactics. And this is more like, this is kind of a traditional thing that salespeople have been taught. Like, oh, hey. So, Nick, is there any reason why you think you couldn't, you know, buy something today or, like, sign today or is, like, signed by the end of the month? And we tend to put, like, a lot of pressure on our customer. Now look. There's a lot of issues that we have as far as, like, how we demo and showcase the value and all that kind of stuff. But those are all kind of, like, missteps. What I'm talking about here is, like, a negative behavior that turns customers off and makes them hate salespeople more than they already do. So when we put that undue pressure, we try to make them move on our timeline. We try to corner them through these tactics. Is there anything that you that would prevent you from moving forward? You know, what do you think about getting the deal done this week? Whatever it is, we have to stop doing that. We have to give our cost and by the way, salespeople do that inadvertently. You know, often, for example, when we do prospecting and I reach out to Nick and I say, Oh, hey, Nick. It's David from Cerebral Selling. Hey, so listen. You know, I was thinking we work with leaders like you all the time to do A, B, and C. If you'd like to spend fifteen minutes, how is Wednesday at 2PM? Like, that's another example of how I'm trying to like, you think to yourself, oh, I'm I'm making it easy. All Nick has to say is, like, yes, and then boom, calendar invite. But what I'm really doing is I'm pushing Nick away by having him think, who's this guy? Why is he shooting times to meet next week? No. I'm if I decide to meet, it's gonna be on my terms. And this is a psychological principle known as reactance, which gets triggered in the mind of our customers. So I would say, just give your customers the freedom to make the lead them, be prescriptive, but give them the freedom to make their own decisions. And you'll see if you give them the option to say no, it's more likely they're gonna say yes. David, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? Well, you know, look. So I give away tons of stuff for free. It's all ungated. So if you go to my website, cerebralselling,all1word,.com, I have a blog. I have a YouTube channel, Cerebral Selling, by the same name, and Instagram if you're on Instagram. So I give away tons of ungated tips for free. And then, of course, there's my book, which unfortunately, I I can't give away for free. But the book is called Sell the Way You Buy, and it is available on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, wherever you buy books. It's on Kindle and audiobook. If you feel like listening to six and a half hours of me reading my own book, you can, you can check it out on Audible as well. David, thanks for coming on. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with David Kramer include number one, you've gotta cut people first before you show them the Band Aid. Always sell them the before version of the infomercial first. Number two, when you hear customer sentiment or when you hear visceral pain, that is a great time to use a story in reply. Number three, ask related questions first before you ask the big question. So for example, you might ask, hey. How many times have you had to ask your vendor for support? Before you ask the big question, which is how happy are you with your vendor today? You're more likely to get a response that leads you in the right direction if you ask the related question first. And then lastly, number four, when you're dealing with any competitors, it's really, really important not to just throw mud, not to get stuck in the feature battle, but more importantly, one, speak in the terms of what your customers see. But then, two, say, hey. Customers say that this competitor is really good for x, and we're really good for y, where x is something that the competitor or the customer rather doesn't care about as much. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Armand, I'm shocked, amazed, and a little confused because every single day I go on to LinkedIn and I click on my red notifications and I see people saying, I love thirty minutes to presidents club. It's such a great show. And I go to reply to that person's comment on a post and I see, wow, they're a third degree connection. And I'm like, connect with the hosts. I like connecting with the audience. So if you're not connected with your wonderfully good looking hosts, Armand and Nick, we will accept all of connection requests except when you try to sell us leads or Bitcoin. So, Armand, I'm really excited because I get to send a lot of sales emails to my prospects, and there's another type of email I'm going to be given the opportunity to start sending soon, and that's a newsletter email to the wonderful listeners of thirty minutes to presidents club. So if you'd like to get a special email from Nick and Armand occasionally, there's a link to sign up for our newsletter in today's show notes. Go sign up and get put in a cadence sequence from us. See you next week on the show.
