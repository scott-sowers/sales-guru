## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my host, Nick Zagalski. And, folks, we are back in studio with the legendary hall of fame multiple time 30 MPC guest, Jake Dunlap. He is a multiple time VP of sales. He is the CEO over at Scaled, and this is one of the greatest episodes we have ever had on figuring out how to accelerate your deal cycle based on where your prospect is at. Nick, why should people listen? So the concept that Jake talks about in this episode is when you meet with a prospect for the first time, they could be anywhere on a range of their buying journey and understanding of the solution, the space, the product, etcetera. The way that you treat somebody who is totally, utterly cold should be really, really different than someone who is hot, ready to buy, and has deep knowledge and expertise of the space that you play in. You shouldn't be running those calls the same. And so Jake talks about a number of different plays that we can run to accelerate deals when you have folks that are a little bit further along in that journey and some of the different approaches that you would take for folks that aren't cold. Jake, welcome back to the show. You may remember we start every episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. So my first one is how to show up for the first meeting prepared in 2025. What are you gonna do? Show up knowing nothing? So every seller, I want you to hit record or whatever right now, and you're gonna send this email 48 before every single call. You are going to say this. Hey, x y z. Looking forward our conversation on Thursday. I talked to many insert job titles, and one, some of them are already exploring options, use something similar, and are really trying to understand the nuances. Others are much earlier in their journey. Help me to understand where you are in yours so I can meet you prepared for that call. Thank you, Jake. Send that email every single time. Boom. Beautiful. What's number two? Number two. If somebody says number one, show up to the call prepared. Bring your sales engineer. If I say, I'm using this product. This is what it is. I use you guys two jobs ago. Mhmm. Get your engineer or if you don't have one, get your manager. Be prepared to have a mini discovery proposal meeting. Be prepared to go deep. Don't just show up like they don't know anything and assume that, you know, the buyer really just is at step zero. Meet them where they're at. Show them you're the expert and get it. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Round us out. What's number three? Okay. Number three is when you're in the deal cycle, we have to realize not everybody wants to hop on a call. Mhmm. Okay? That's what I was trained, many of you. Hey, Jake. I've got a question. Yeah. Let's hop on a call and talk about it. Okay. What's the reality today? How do you like to consume? Do you like to get on the phone, or do you like an asynchronous video? Mhmm. Hey, John. Really great question. +1, 234. Hope this helps. Oh, your CFO had this question? Here's a video for her. One, two, three, four. So for me, asynchronous video is the future of how we're gonna educate people middle funnel all day. Jake, in the prep, you talked about a spectrum where a buyer could be completely cold or literally ready to self serve. There were, I think, four buckets that you mapped out where a prospect could reply to you, and that's gonna change the way that you approach the call. What are those four different buckets? Yeah. So in the book, Innovative Seller, we talk about it's called a concept called VECS, v e c s. So v is for vetted, e is for educated, c is for cold, and s is for self-service. And, really, I developed this by just, like, observing buyer behavior. And you're seeing this more and more. You're seeing, like, look, buyers you know, six years ago, there wasn't that much stuff about your company online. I there was no, like, ability for me to be educated or vetted, or I hadn't bought that technology two or three times. So when we think about it, a lot of this is just trying to understand, you know, vetted and some of those behaviors. In the book, we give some examples. But think, like, I'm already using your competitor Mhmm. And we're and we're up for renewal in the next sixty days. Mhmm. Right? Right. That's pretty dang vetted. I've already used your, you know, product at a previous company. Yep. Right? Think about the things that would help you to know, like, let's go. Educated might be like that step before. Yeah. We've used some, like, similar type products. I'm not really sure if we're ready to make a change, but I definitely know the space. Definitely interested in kind of understanding what's next. Hold is, you know, hey. You reached out to me, dude. Yeah. Like, hey. You reached out to me. This is interesting. I heard about you guy. I heard your name at a trade show. Don't really know a lot. And then self-service, look, you know, I talk about this, like, you know, in the book. McKinsey did a survey. In the years to come, people already said, I think, 30% of buyers are ready to self-service Mhmm. At, like, 40 k. Yeah. I think for a lot of reps, they're like, no. It's like, oh, yeah. If I already know the space, I know what's happening. I know the application. I've rolled it out three times. I care about your success team. Sorry, Seller. Love you. But, like, I can we just go talk to these people who are gonna actually set me up anyway? Yeah. So so that's the concept there. And then, you know, it's really not that complicated to engineer parts of your sales process. And for you as a seller, you don't need your company to do this. You can do this. If someone says that to you, why wait three calls to get there? Again, a lot of companies right now are artificially inflating their sales cycle. Mhmm. They're making it to the buyer's telling you, I am here. Show up ready. That's step three. I'm sorry it doesn't fit your criteria to skip it to step three. You can fill it out after the call. We're just not prepared for this this nonlinear buying journey Mhmm. Right now. So let's pretend that someone comes inbound, and they're like, hey. I'm currently using sales engagement platform. We'll call it SalesLoft. Yep. And I'm selling Outreach today. I don't really have to sell them on why use a sales engagement platform at all. And that's what a lot of sellers would do on a first to start. So you jump on that call. You know they're about to renew SalesLoft in two to three months. How do you run that call differently if you're selling a competing sales invoice? It's a it's a super, super question. So I want you to think, look, you still need to do a discovery a little bit. Right? So, again, the it's it's kinda like I I like to think a lot of sales is, like, it's a a longer process. It's like an accordion. Right? So think of it like a more condensed discovery where I'm still gonna say, hey, John. Great. I've worked with a lot of other directors of DemandGen. What are your top two or three responses? You know, again, so I would still do that. I'd say, alright. So when it comes to outreach and the priority for the department, tell me a little bit about those priorities. Mhmm. And then I wanna understand gaps. Hey. What are the must haves for you? What are the things, like, that you would like to see differently? And what would an ideal outcome look like? Right? So we talk about that. What's working well? What's not? And what would ideal outcome? So that's about what I'm gonna do. Because in that way, whenever I do the demo, I can frame those things. But, again, instead of the the discovery might being twenty minutes Mhmm. Maybe it's ten. You know? Maybe it's like I'm gonna do phase one of the discovery now. We'll do a follow-up call later once we kind of get into the the vetting process. But But I still need to know, like, what's the decision criteria for this person. So and then, again, we should be able to hop into it. We should say, like, great. So, hey, you'd mentioned these things are important. Let's talk through about how we do those things a little differently. You mentioned this, etcetera. Typical next steps, you still need to drive momentum. But, again, maybe now because the sales engineer was on the call or whatever, now we're ready to go to proposal. And, you know, or maybe, again, we're ready to do just a a quick broader demo with their team, and then we're ready to go to proposal. So instead of first call is, okay. Well, great. Here's what we do. It's like, you do? Like, it kind of. Right? Like and then the next call is this long demo, and then you're doing more things. It's like, could you just skip ahead if you were, like, just being thoughtful about where this person is in the process? I'm not gonna over assume. I'm still gonna ask the question to judge. Mhmm. Are they really vetted? Because maybe I do need to back it up a little bit. But that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna run a truncated discovery process, and then I'm gonna be prepared to move quickly and drive momentum. So let's say I am a AE who's listening to this episode, and I'm like, I am picking up what Jake is putting down, but I don't run the org. I don't run the sales. Yeah. Exactly. I don't run the SME or SE or Of course. I have control over my sales engineer, and now I need to go to my SE team and say, hey. This is a first call, but I need you on this. How do I articulate that to my sales engineering resources so that I get someone good, prepared, and happy to be on that customer call? Well, I think that that's the that's what the first email is gonna help you with. Right? Because the first email and and look. If someone responds to you in that first email, do you think you can ask a follow-up question? Yeah. Totally. He sure can. Mhmm. Exactly. So if they come in and they say, Jake, duh duh duh duh duh duh, actually, again, in that example, I used SalesLoft already. Yep. I used you guys before. Some of those questions in the discovery, I might ask that in a follow-up email. Alright. Hey, John. Great. I'm looking forward to it. I'm already talking to my my team behind the scenes here. Mhmm. Help me to understand, like, maybe what are one of the top two or three areas that you're would like to see different, and what are the some of the things maybe you've heard about us and what we're doing? Well, this, this, and this, and that if I take that to my SC Yeah. Or my manager Mhmm. I say, I've got somebody who looks like this, this, this, this. They already know this. Yeah. Man, you need to look for another job. If they're like if they're literally like, nah. We gotta like, again, like, it's in it's I think we're so stuck in this mindset of, like, but that does not compute. We have to start here. Mhmm. I would like to think most managers are very reasonable people. And if you showed them a back and forth that said they're already doing this, they're already doing this, they would be, like, get on the call. I remember there was this one time where this girl was trying to do a rip and replace. I was on one call recording platform, and she was trying to get me onto another call recording platform. And so she got on a call. And to your point, she started with the biggest priorities as it pertain to me growing the SDR org because I'd just taken over the SDR org. And she started there, which is probably how she would have started any discovery call. Mhmm. But then immediately Mhmm. She was like, look. You already have a call recording tool. You know these four things exist in all the tools on the market. I'm now going to talk about the three places where there are gaps Love it. Where you can't meet those priorities because you're on this tool today. Yeah. And 75% of the call was focused on everything that my current tool could not do Yep. Versus what most sellers do is they find out halfway through their deal cycle Mhmm. That they're involved, and they're like, oh, shoot. I should probably start asking some trap questions. That's right. Yeah. And Gong did research on this long time ago. It's like, there was, like, a, you know, correlation between talking about the competition on the first call and win rates. I mean, this is, like, years ago now I remember seeing this too. I guess question for you. If they don't respond to that email because sometimes our buyer don't respond to that pre meeting email. Yeah. Of course. How are you getting information on where they are in that journey before you start just, like, jumping in and running it like a normal call? I love your example. That is exactly it. I'm gonna start them off in the cold process. I'm gonna run my typical how I start the meeting, set the agenda, run the discovery. Mhmm. And then if in the discovery, I understand these things. Again, this is where sellers we've gotta stop just going through the motions. Mhmm. Like, we have to turn on the brain and be like, oh, great. Because I'm an expert. Mhmm. I'm a consultant. I'm gonna help you. I've always had that mindset as a seller. I don't know where necessarily it came from, but it's like, look, my job is to help to get you on the path. Once you tell me your path is here, well, I need to help you down that path. And he told me his path is I already use this. I know them because we compete against them all the time. Okay. Well, great. I I love that talk track. I think every seller could literally steal Yeah. Like, a template there of, like, oh, great. Well, look. If you're already doing that Mhmm. Then let me ask you a couple of extra questions. What are the gaps? Mhmm. What do you wanna see different? Okay. Well, great. Let me tell you a little bit about us and how we think about the things that you said that matter. Yeah. Okay. So since you're already here, when's your renewal up? Boom. Then I'm gonna start to say, hey. Let's move this person past step two to step three. You know what I mean? So I I really love that example because it's just it's a really great seller that did that. Recognize where your path is. Don't try to put everyone on the same path. Listen. Yeah. You know, stop multitasking. Get off Slack. Get off your email and listen, or you're gonna miss a lot of these nuances. Yeah. I mean, what it really reminds me of what you guys are talking about is there's a concept in competitive deals about the winning zone, the neutral zone, and the losing zone, where if you think about you and your competitor, there is some overlap. Like, if you think about a Venn diagram, there are areas that you beat them. That's your winning zone. There are areas that they beat you. That's the losing zone. And then there are areas that you are basically the same. That is the neutral zone. And in order to win a competitive deal, you need to spend most of the focus with them on amplifying the importance of your winning zone. You need to neutralize the losing zone in their mind, and then you just need to make sure they know you check the box in the neutral zone where you're basically the same as them. But if you don't know where they're at, you don't even know, do I need to accelerate the conversation to focus on these zones, or are we talking to somebody cold? Because you're running educate them on why this is important. Yeah. This is different than just your basic recording tool. Yep. And Mhmm. And if what they tell me is these things that I went on don't matter, well, then, like, look, that's not necessarily where we can help you. And then I kind of plant seeds where I'm, like, if this happens and this happens over the next, you know, before your renewal, let's pick up the conversation in thirty days, and I already know those things are gonna happen. Right? Yeah. So I wanna swing all the way to the other direction. Mhmm. So this is talking about established space, established solution. I know what you do. I might even be using a competitive product. There are other spaces where they don't use anything in your space. Yep. In fact, your space might be a very nascent space, and you have to spend more of your time just, like, explaining, like, why this solution even exists in the world and educating them on it. So, for example, a lot of these new AI powered SDRs, a lot of leaders getting on these calls and they're like, what is this magic meatloaf thing? Is it gonna, like, take over half my team? Does it actually work? And my guess is you're not focusing on differentiation from competition in those calls. You're focusing on education. So how do how do you run those calls? You gotta think of those. I mean, those are the ones where, yeah, you're starting somewhat up from the beginning. Because here's the thing, if if from an education, if they don't believe the thesis if they don't believe the thesis that the future is this, you're gonna have some SDRs, and I'm just gonna make up a value prop for one of these companies. Mhmm. You have some SDRs that are doing this high value, whatever touch point. You have this account coverage model where you need to do this. Mhmm. The future is the hybrid approach. Mhmm. And if you have reps that are hitting send all on emails, they're making calls that are all vanilla Mhmm. Do you think that that is going to be replaced? If you don't buy the thesis, me demoing my product has nothing to do with it. So this more, like, sales technique y. Yeah. So I need to educate. And then for even those companies, what I would say is you're still looking ways to educate outside of the hop on a call. B two b sales is very behind Mhmm. In terms of ways to educate people with videos Mhmm. With, you know I'm not a big fan of, like, long things. But, again, think about different videos for different use cases. Like, every company should have a demo geared for the CFO. Yeah. A demo geared for the director, a demo geared for the end user. You know, this one's five minutes. This one's four minutes. This ability for people to self educate is the future. Whether you're in a brand new category or a competitive category, I think sales teams are very, very behind and marketing teams are very, very behind how people actually wanna consume content. Yeah. I mean, it makes me think about when I sold ERP software to law firms, we got slowed down so much in the deal process because anytime the prospect had a question that I couldn't answer, I had to go get a prospect had a question that I couldn't answer, I had to go get a sales engineering resource, and they always wanted to meet with the prospect live to hop on a call. And that might elongate our sales process by a week because we wouldn't be available to meet that week, and they had meetings and, like, alright. Great. We're gonna see you next Wednesday. And if we had built out any sort of just, like, generic library that would have gotten people 80% of the way there and then I could add extra context, we would have sped things up like crazy. Yeah. So some plays that I'm hearing from you that I can use to accelerate my deal when I have somebody who is closer to that vetted end of the spectrum, first one I heard is, like, first call, I'm bringing on an SE. I'm bringing on a manager. I'm hearing this, like, asynchronous video as a way to get them information faster to accelerate. What other plays do I have in my toolkit that I can start to use to move my deals faster? Yeah. I think those two to me are some of, like, the easier ones as a part of this. And I think just really also being thoughtful with this concept, and we talked about this for a long time, that more kind of disparate communications, whether it's more meetings with different people or communicating separately outside of through one channel can accelerate deals. Yeah. That, you know, especially in more complex deals where you know that there are these multiple people. So it might not be the modalities. Like, I still love asynchronous videos, like, probably my favorite modality for a lot of this, but I might separate it. I might send three recaps. Mhmm. One for the CTO. Hey, John. I'm really looking forward to our meeting in two days. We're gonna talk about more technical requirements. Blah blah blah blah. Hey, Jake. I'm really excited about, you know, a b c. I think that the ability to parallel path all these buyers, which is what you do in your proposal. Right? So, hey. This is why it's in it for you. This is what's in it for you. Those are my go to ways to do it. You know, also I'm a big fan of, like, transparency around pricing relatively early. I think we kind of expect this now. We're being so trained in our b to c buying behavior of, like, now 100% transparency. Yeah. One click to buy. Like, you just have to think all those behaviors are conditioning us in buying on b two b as well too. So I think I like those those modes and those those plays, and then just think about how you can get even more specific to individual buyer, you know, people in the buying circle. I wanna go back to some of these colder deals because I know there are a lot of sellers who are listening who sell a product that is not very well known. You talked a lot about, I'm gonna spend a lot of time really digging into the problem before I show the solution. Mhmm. And this is absolutely what happened to me at Pave is we were selling compensation software. No one used a compensation planning tool. It was always on Excel. Mhmm. Yeah. So it was, like, a weird thing Mhmm. To even consider buying a compensation planning tool. So we would have to get them to sit in the pain of running comp cycles for calls and calls and calls and calls and, like, dose the software and along the way, like, use references to be like, hey. You're not weird for using a tool. Look at all these companies like you that are also solving and feeling this problem. I'm curious, Jake. What are other tactics that I can use in a completely cold sales cycle Yeah. To make it real and not feel like it's a weird thing to buy myself? Yeah. I wanna be clear. You should do a mini demo in the first call. I think this is a big mistake. You know, we call it we've got one client. They call we call it the harbor tour, which is this kind of five minute, you know, another sales leader. I stole this from him years ago. He called it, you know, kind of a level one demo, which is a five minute walk through where you can quickly say, look. Great, Jake. So in the next call so how you kind of do the setup for that? You say, like, look. So great. I appreciate you taking some time. Then you do the education piece. Yeah, Jake. That actually is something we're thinking about. Okay. Well, look. Let me give you a quick high level. And then in the next conversation, what we're gonna do, you mentioned these other people. We'll set up time with them. We'll do a more comprehensive walk through some of the people who might be actually using it. If that looks good, then we'll put together pricing, etcetera. But let me give you a quick high level, maybe answer some basic questions, and then we'll do a more detailed. Does that work for you, Nick? They're gonna say yes. And then you say, great. So let's talk about the three things that you mentioned. Number one is you mentioned this. Right? So you can have in every demo, everyone should have a five minute demo, maybe, five to eight minutes Yeah. Where you have five stopping points. And based on the things that they told you, you only stop at those destinations. So if they didn't mention one, you just say, great. So we can do this, but let's talk about this. You know, again, you mentioned comp planning. You mentioned the interaction points. So let me just show you really quickly, like, how we can do that. And then third, you mentioned this. Great. Again, you're driving to the next meeting. I think that this is really important. I do not think that a sales call should ever exist for the benefit of one person. That they should always walk away getting some value. So everybody needs to have that level one, you know, demo that's not the, you know, the forty five minute demo. Right? It's just, like, get them excited. That's what I wanna do is I wanna build excitement and momentum for the next the next call. What do the next levels of demos look like? It depends on the audience, man. So, again, like, I'll give you two scenarios. You come in through a department head, and then the department head brings in their team. What do you think the goal should be? I need to get these people losing their minds. Mhmm. And I need them to be, like, great. So I'll give you the one of the biggest issues that people don't do. So here's I'm gonna get real tactical with you guys. Here's how you have to start every big meeting. K? Never think. You are not some person who needs to get up on stage and dance. Okay? That's not your job. The second call with their team, here's exactly what I want you to say. Hey, guys. Really excited for the conversation today. I had a really good first conversation with Nick. And so looking forward to talking to you how I think we can we can do some of that. So first, what we're gonna do is let me just recap what I heard from Nick. Mhmm. And then and this is what you're not doing today probably. I wanna just maybe spend a couple of minutes and hear how maybe a couple of you are seeing some of these problems or maybe it's a little bit different. So great. My conversation with Nick, we talked about this. How would you all describe this? So, again, it's very clear here. Get rid of does that make sense? A close ended questions. Right? So I might go through one, two, three. So these are the three things I heard. Let me ask you this. So, you know, this person who just did an intro, you know, John. Hey, John. So, like, how would you view these problems based on your role as social media manager? I get them talking. And then when I do the demo, I start my dance. I start directing different pieces at each individual. Mhmm. So then they see, like, oh, John sees how it helps him in social media. Rick sees how it's gonna help him with marketing analytics. And then the same thing with a complex deal. If your second meeting on the flip side is with multiple stakeholders outside of one department. K? That's the other, you know, pitfall that we run into. Right? One is that demo. The end users need to get excited about it, etcetera. And then the other is the the multiple stakeholders group here. And, again, this is about your modernizing your customer journey, etcetera. How you're gonna start that meeting is very similar. Hey. Had a really good conversation with Nick, but I also, you know, wanna verify, hey. For you IT, you know, for you operations, maybe some areas that you'd like to add. The thing that you always wanna do just as a pro tip is just isolate IT and isolate HR. So how you start any big meeting with complex deals, if if they're not your main buyer, to be very clear. Mhmm. And you'll say, okay, guys. Look. The goal of this conversation I had a good conversation, Nick, is really just to talk through big picture. I think we might be able to help. IT, you know, I know, hey, John. You're you know, you we did intros already, I'm assuming. We're actually gonna set up a more technical conversation here in the next three or four days where we can go a little bit deeper on integrations. We're, again, reiterate goal for today is to just see is there a potential alignment here? Yeah. And then you recap. You get people's input. IT asks those bullshit questions where they're like, well, what about this, this, and this? Is the second call? You're like, that is a great question, Jake. That's exactly what we're gonna talk about next week. Mhmm. Next topic. And then you don't let IT derail. I might send out videos afterwards. After that call, hey, IT. Looking forward to our call in forty eight hours. Here's a quick high level you can watch about our APIs and integrations. Some of these are kind of tried and true things that, like, still very much work today that are more, like, controlling the room, I guess, techniques as a part of it. But I think every seller needs to know this stuff. But what I'm hearing is there's this theme that's coming full circle, which is sometimes you've brought a prospect through stages one, two, and three. If you get to stage three, you're presenting to the big team. So many sellers are like, alright. I'm gonna start discovery all over again. Or they're like, great. I'm just gonna jump into the demo even though there are three people on the room who literally have no idea what we do. Mhmm. And what you wanna do is you want to meet the team where they're at. Exactly. You want to recap 80% of what you've learned about the organization and the problems that they have. Whether that were things that happened in previous closed loss opportunities and you're bringing those to the first discovery call, whether that's a reply that they sent to your forty eight hour email, or whether those are things that you learn on the first two calls with your champion. And then it's almost like once you've got the snowball rolling Yes. Every call adds another 20% to that layer. So you say, like, great. Here are the problems that we've already learned based on everything you've done with us in the past. Would you add the next 20%? So you're not starting all over again, which is the most frustrating thing in the world for a buyer. And the other thing that you talked about that I think is really important is you have to understand when we get into deals that are slightly more complex. But the reality is people buy in teams. That there is a buying team, the people that are, you know, at the decision making process. They're the people that are gonna either sign but also influence that. And then you have an end user team. Every deal has these two teams. Mhmm. So guess what? Your end user team might come in vetted. But guess what? They loop in somebody on the buyer team. We might have to your point. I need to start back here. Hey. This is what we're doing. Then we move forward. So we also have to think about not all deals are, you know, linear. Right? We're trying to meet each group in each meeting where they are. That's what I'm trying to think about is where is this group of people? And, you know, do I need to actually do a first prep call with that buying team Mhmm. To catch them up to where now the whole snowball is, you know, kind of rolling here. So I think that's just an important caveat you called about. These different groups that might not be at the same stage, and that's your job as a seller to not assume that they they are. You you you've gotta meet them there. What I'm hearing from you is that humans end up falling somewhere on that VEX scale of vetted edge Exactly. To sell service, not accounts. Yeah. Because I might be fully vetted, and Armand is totally and utterly clueless. And so you need to work us and engage with us differently. So I guess my question is if you're working a deal, you're probably starting with one person, and I hear that first meeting email that you send of, like, hey. Where are you? What do you do to make sure that you're never showing up unprepared with somebody on a call as it relates to not knowing where they are? Because you're gonna be talking to multiple people. Yeah. Especially once you start to get into the deal cycle. So there's a couple different, like, tactics or techniques here we can kind of dive into. You know, the first is, again, when I get into, like, that broader call with the team, it's always helpful for maybe at the end of like, in between the calls, I might ask again asynchronously, etcetera. Right? I ask the person, but I don't fully take into account their answer. Like, I'm still gonna verify because that's one person. That's why the concept of, like, a singular champion. It's like, they have they have one perspective. I'm always like, great. You're you're amazing person, but I also need to go verify this stuff for myself. So I'm always gonna start the process, like, if I don't know that we're at the cold process and then, like, we talked about to bring it kind of full circle, as soon as I hear those indicators again. But look, if their whole team is already using this software, we're probably here. But I need all of them to tell me what their things that they like are and what they didn't like. So then I can highlight the other things outside of the concentric circle that they might have mentioned. So I think there's always this, like, realignment. Discovery is really never done. You know, you're doing, like, a reconfirmation. You know, how many of you have lost deals at the end because they're like, oh, what about that thing? And you're like, dude, we could have talked about that. I don't know what happened. And it's usually because you heard what they wanted in the beginning, and you kinda pulled that through line, but it's been six weeks, eight weeks. And things have changed, priorities have shifted, and you didn't do kind of that reconfirmation or realignment to just try to meet people where they're at. Maybe something happened. Somebody left. There's so many things that happen in today's world. People leaving jobs, economy Mhmm. That, you know, I think it's just much more dynamic to be a seller today that you need to be able to meet people where they're at and understand that where they were two weeks ago could be foundationally different than where they are today. When I was a VP of sales at Pave, I was brought in to buy software at the end of an evaluation. I knew directionally my rev ops team was looking into a CPQ platform. I had no idea what CPQ means. If you're not familiar with what CPQ Yeah. Is, folks, it's like what actually allows you to, like, punch in a quote into your CRM or software. It automatically populates your opportunities with, like, how many seats, you know, year over year expansion, and then it'll generate a proposal. So I get on this call, and they're, like, talking in all this jargon about the differentiators of why this CPQ is better than this CPQ platform. And I just look at the screen, and I'm like, hey, guys. What's CPQ? And it completely just tanked the call for me. I love it. I was like, dude, I'm sorry. Like, I don't even know what CPQ is. I love that you said that, though. At least you're like, you know, like, hey, man. Let's start back. Wait. Because most buyers are gonna start looking at their Slack, totally tune out, and then Right. Nix the purchase because they're like, I don't even know how this is relevant to our That's right. Oh, man. Jake, this has been an amazing episode, but we are running out of time, and we have to move to the last question, which is we've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of sellers exhibiting that they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Multitasking. Our human brain actually is not good at multitasking. My friends, the sales meeting is is showtime. Yeah. That is our game time. And if you are sitting there and you are multitask, you are missing so much. You're missing the verbal cues, the nuances of, like, oh, does his pitch just go up real quick? Multitasking is killing more sales and an over focus on, like, am I looking at the right person on Zoom versus my hearing globally? Yeah. Stop multitasking. This is Showtime. You spend all the time to do the prospecting. This is it. You better be present. You know, I did see on what was it? AJ Brown reading a book on the sidelines the other day. Right? Like, multitasking. But for for the rest of you, this is showtime. So don't multitask in your meetings. Phenomenal. Be present. Jake, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a 60 recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It is time for a two by two recap from this episode with Jake Dunlap. What do you have for your two? So number one is you have to understand where the human being you are talking to falls on that VEX scale. V is for vetted, e is for educated, c is for cold, and s is for self-service. Somebody who is vetted using a competitor looking to move should be treated differently than someone who's educated. They feel pretty good, but they want a little bit more, which would also be different than someone who is totally cold and is, like, new to the space. So So understand where they fall on that spectrum and treat those folks differently. Number two is in order to figure out where somebody falls on that spectrum, you gotta ask them. And so send that email that Jake talked about in the beginning of the episode where you ask, where are you today in your journey of learning about this stuff? Number three, if you get someone who is vetted or they might even be on a competitive solution Mhmm. You still start with the business priorities, but then you wanna jump right to the gaps with their solution today and then their ideal outcome. You do not wanna do discovery on why you need a sales engagement platform if they literally already have a sales engagement platform. And then lastly, number four, the same deal goes for third, fourth call inside of a sales cycle. You don't wanna restart discovery every single time a new person gets added to the call. So what you do is you recap everything you've learned, and then you say, hey, Anna. I'm curious. How do these problems impact what you're seeing in the social media department? Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? There are two ways. Way number one, if you wanna go deeper on some of the stuff that Jake talked about today, he wrote a phenomenal book called The Innovative Seller. There's a link in the show notes. I highly recommend picking up a copy. Let him know we sent them your way. Great read. Number two is Jake talked about that bigger team demo. When you've got multiple people in the room, you're gonna recap the priorities. That's something we talk about at thirty MPC a lot, the big team demo deck. We have built an example team demo deck that you can go use to run more effective meetings when you have two, three, four people in the room. So links in the show notes for both of those things. Thank you for listening, and we will see you next week on 30.
