## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farouk. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have Jeremy Leveille of LeadIQ. If you look him up on LinkedIn, he's wearing a flamingo suit, and he's booked hundreds of hundreds hilarious meetings with his prospecting style. Nick, why should people listen? Well, we talk about using the guitar to book meetings as well as some best practices for sending GIFs or GIFs, whatever you wanna call them. Three, two, one. GIF. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning.

Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright. Jeremy, welcome to thirty minutes to presidents club. You know we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. The first one, I call it a customer info spreadsheet. So what the customer info spreadsheet has, it's a spreadsheet that you can get as detailed as you want, but the idea is you have a bunch of pretty detailed information on your top customers. You outline where they're based, what industry they're in, where is that company located, why did they buy from you, who is the champion. And so you have all that and it's your it's bookmarked on your computer. You can refer back to it anytime. So now you can speak more knowledgeable about your about your customers. That's that's the first one. Cool. What's number two, Jeremy? Number two is getting into not necessarily the accounts that you're going after, but the buyer personas, the people at those accounts. So it's a buyer knowledge document. As you're prospecting and you find people that have a really detailed LinkedIn profile that fit that ideal they're the right person that you wanna reach out to, they have a really detailed LinkedIn profile. You just screenshot their summary that outlines all of their different roles and responsibilities and what projects they've worked on, what are their skills and everything, what's most important to them. When you find people like that, screenshot it and add it to this buyer knowledge document. And once you get, like, three, four, five, or or six of those, then you're gonna be able to really get in and dig in deep and better understand what is most important to these people. And you can speak their language and use use that in your messaging. I love it. Round us out. What's number three? I call it a LinkedIn connection play. So you're not necessarily connecting with prospects because they're gonna just be like, oh, well, who who the hell is this guy? Like, I don't know who you are. You're just some sales rep trolley. Gonna just connect with me and then immediately pitch me after. So instead, connect with your customers because there's less friction there. They, like, they already are customers. And you just reach out to them. You send them a personalized connection request and say, hey, so and so. Thanks for being a customer of LeadIQ. You rock. And they're obviously gonna accept they're a customer, like, you know, you're not trying to, like, do anything weird. And then there's some different things that can happen there. One is they give you a referral if you connect with them on LinkedIn. Two is they might say something really great about some of the success they've had with your product, and you can screenshot that and use that in your messaging. Or they might change jobs and go to another company, and you can then sell to them at their new company. So, Jeremy, you are the king, at least what I've heard, of tailoring and getting people to laugh and being super, super creative. So let's start super high level here. When you pick up an account and you're like, oh, this is a pretty solid account, what the heck are you doing to stand out and separate yourself from the crowd from a tailoring standpoint? Like, when I reach out to that person, I want it to be very obvious. And I'm not subtle. Like, I make it painfully obvious that this is not your typical just, like, random sales rep calling out of the blue, out of nowhere, no context, and I'm treating it as if I'm on my own one yard line here. I'm at the 50 yard line. Like, you know you know who we are. Like, you know, I'm looking at previous account history in in Salesforce to see if if there was an old opportunity in there, if there's been prior conversations we've had with that account, and using that in the messaging. Like, I just am fanatical about in a very short amount of time without it taking too long, and you get this analysis paralysis in, like, no more than five minutes. Do that research on the the account on that person so you have not just one. You have multiple triggers and and ways to reach out because even if it is really, like, personalized, they might not reach out they might not reply to that first email. What are you gonna come back with for the for your second email? And third, you have to be able to have a few different ways at breaking through the noise and being able to get their attention to really make it painfully obvious that this is not just, like, some complete out of the cold message that, you know, you you have some context here. So, Jeremy, you talk about, like, being so obvious that you're not, like, all the way on your own one yard line. Right? And a lot of people talk about that, but how do you just throw it in their face? What are you actually doing or saying or writing to make it be like, oh, like, this guy is very different? Yeah. So a couple things that I do is in the beginning of the email, if I'm calling or call or email, whatever, like, I cut out the small talk in the beginning. If I cold call somebody, I don't say how are you? I don't say how are you doing? How's it going? Like, how's your day going? Like, they don't care about that stuff. Like, I get right into it. I'm not subtle. Like, I get right into it quick. And if it's an email, oh, hope you're doing well today. I get rid of all that pleasantry stuff. And then secondly, I use visual things as well. If it's an email, obviously, you know, not not like sending a video on the phone. We haven't got there with technology yet. But, you know, so visuals like screenshots or videos or GIFs, you know? I'm I'm big on, like, literally probably 90 of any cold email that I send is gonna have at least well, not probably just one. Not gonna do more of those in the same email. But it's gonna have 90% of them are gonna have either a GIF or a video or a screenshot. So, like, screenshots, I have a folder. It's on our Google Drive and it's called screenshots for sales. So anytime, like, a customer says something really good about lead IQ and the success they've had with it, the results that they've had for for their team, why they bought it, you know, whatever, we screenshot that and put it in that folder. Then I can pick and choose which one and and drop them into certain situations. So those screenshots, like, I'm making it painfully obvious to that person. If they say they use ZoomInfo, I have a screenshot that says somebody's increased their pipeline generated by 45% with lead IQ instead of ZoomInfo. So I can put that screenshot in there. I'm making it painfully obvious. Like, like, they'd have to be stupid not to take the meeting if I send them a screenshot like that. Oh, okay. I gotta dig into this GIF thing because I haven't heard people using them before. What are you doing for ladies at GIFs? So I use them in a few different situations. So if somebody is using, say, for example, SalesLoft or Outreach, we integrate with both of them. So I have a it's like a three second GIF that actually shows how the integration works and how you can directly add people right into a sequence or a cadence. So, hey. So and so. You use sales, like, all I won't cut out the small talk. No pleasantry shit. Like, oh, how are you doing? Hey, so and so. I see you're using SalesLoft. Here's how our integration works with it. Boom. And then there's the GIF, and then I just call to action. Is it cool if we schedule a call and we can talk more about this next week? Jeremy. So that that's one GIF is kind of, like, showing how those integrations work, but then I have, like, some silly GIFs. If they again, if they use SalesLoft or Outreach, I'll kind of say to them, hey. Our our SalesLoft or Outreach integration is smooth as butter. And I have this hilarious GIF where it's like this, like, piece of toast that's going like this with this little piece of butter, and it's it's going like this rubbing of butter on its belly, but it's like it's like a cartoon, like, piece of toast thing. You know? I mean, any it could be any software, any technology. If you're saying, hey. Our our insert whatever feature is smooth as butter, you could put that GIF in there. You know? And then, like, another one is, like, if I if maybe I messed up and was supposed to follow-up with them in two months, but then I reached back out in, like, three months, And then I might say, oh, you said we should we should sync back up at three months. I hope I didn't miss the boat here. And then there's a hilarious gift that I have saved on my computer of a guy. You know, he's on, like, a dock, and the boat is, like, moving away from him on the dock. And then, like, he's trying to get into the boat and he falls in the water. So, you know, that's just a bunch of GIFs that I use. What else are you doing around the visual prospecting? I know you've got some interesting ideas around video too. And so, like, with videos, I have a guitar right over there in the corner here, and so I'll play guitar songs. And, like, I don't even know how to play the guitar. But I just, like, I'm holding it the wrong way, and, like, I'm strumming strumming the wrong chords. But, like, I'm putting myself out there. You know? And, like, and I'm, like, singing a song. It's, like, about the person and, like, maybe research that I did about them and, like, past opportunities we've had with them, whatever, like, any integrations, but, like, it's a song. And I'm making the song up as I go. It's not like it's taking me. So that that's how I can kinda scale it. Like, it literally I just hit record, and then I get my guitar, and I'm singing the song, and, like, I'm done in two minutes. And so most a lot of reps are spending longer than two minutes to type out an email. I've I just recorded that and hit send and sent it in only two minutes, and I'm not I'm, like, making up the the words as I go. And at one point, I had 20 videos that I sent where they were guitar videos. I got a response to 18 out of 20. And out of those 18, I think all of them except for, like, two booked meetings, and we had, like, five closed won deals. So I I hate to do this, and and we're totally fine to edit this out if you wanna say no. But would you be terribly opposed to, like, playing us a quick thirty second video with your guitar so we actually get a sense of what this sounds like? Oh, yeah. Sure. This has gotta be the video gram, Nick. Oh, he's got it ready. The guitar's coming out. Uh-oh. Yeah. And so the other cool thing when I do these videos is, like, if you guys or, you know, anybody watching the podcast has seen, like, parks and recreation, I kind of do, like, the Chris Pratt voice, like his singing voice. So it's kinda, like, really goofy and silly. And I'll be like, and I will really wanna talk to you. And we're gonna have this meeting and see how we can help out your sales team and book more meetings. I saw that you viewed my LinkedIn profile, and that's really cool. Some of the cool stuff you guys are doing over there. And I'll even, like, sometimes go high with the with, like, random notes, like, going high with it. Like, it's it's cringeworthy, but, like, you'd be surprised at the results. And, you know, it'll it'll be like a one almost two minutes. You know? But it usually does pretty good. This is amazing. I haven't said this many times on the podcast. I've actually never seen anything like that before. That's what the prospects say when they see the video. Like, I sent one of these I won't say the the name of the company, but he's a VP of sales and and strategy operations, whatever, for this for this company that is, like, five, six hundred employees. He replied to the video, and he said, Jeremy, this is effing hilarious. He said he spelled out the word, this is effing hilarious. We're just now starting to figure out how to use video in our in our prospecting. And based on your video, I don't think we're we're using it to the extent that we could be. I just forwarded this to our entire sales organization. And he was, like, saying this is hilarious, but, like, in a good way, I guess, because he replied, and they are now our customer. They got 30 licenses of LeadIQ now, and that sales cycle was, like, not even three months. So So one of the things you talked about earlier, Jeremy, was looking for common triggers or common hooks so that you can personalize off of that. And you just rattled off a couple here. Mutual connection, last company the person worked for is one of your present customers' competitor. What other hooks are you looking for when you're like, I'm gonna write a guitar song for somebody, but I wanna make this thing a step more personalized? Yeah. A couple other ones in addition to those are their LinkedIn history, like their posts, like, things that they posted. I had one guitar song where, you know, I just like, the trigger that maybe reached out to her was something she posted because, like, I was able to it wasn't, like, this awkward, like you know, it was organic for me to be able to connect the dots between the thing that she posted and LeadIQ's value prop, what we actually do. So I was able to in an organic way, not like a weird forced way, you know, where you're trying to we've all seen emails like that where they do a personalized thing. They they message that personalized thing, and then they talk about what their product does. And it's like, what the hell does that have to you know, there's no it's a real weird transition. So just things that they post on LinkedIn, if you can make that smooth transition there. And then also technographic data is another thing that you can really quickly, you know, do that research, see you know, I've mentioned a couple examples already. Like, if they use, like, SalesLoft or Outreach, which we integrate with. Like, if I can see that, then I'll I'll put that in my messaging. So those are a couple other ways that you can, you know, quickly see something and then work that as a trigger into your messaging too. So I'm getting the sense of we call it disarmingly blunt where it comes into your mind and you just freaking say the thing. Like, get rid of all the pleasantries. So I love that. We talked about emails. We talked about researching. You mentioned that you're also doing this on the cold calls where you're not asking, like, how's your day going? Did I catch you at a bad time? All that nonsense. So, like, what are you doing when you start a cold call? So I just say once I know it's the right person, then I say, hey. It's Jeremy over at at lead I q. And I purposely say Jeremy over at lead I q because it's more casual. And I don't say this is Jeremy calling with lead I q because that's more formal. And it sounds kinda just that sounds kinda awkward and sales y, like Jeremy calling with LeadIQ. Like, a, that's too formal, and, b, they know it's a call. Like, they you know, you don't have to say I'm calling with and I just kinda say, hey. I know I'm calling out of the blue here. So, like, acknowledging, hey. I know I'm calling out of the blue here. Is it cool if I explain the reason for my call in less than thirty seconds? That's my normal opener. You know? So it's kinda just asking for permission, but it's also more more casual and more conversational by just, like, saying, is it cool? Is it cool if I explain why I'm calling in less than thirty seconds? You know? And then nine times out of 10, they say yes. And then from there, it's that I'm not just saying, hey. We're we're a prospecting tool that can get data into Salesforce. Like, no. You know? I'm then a lot like, aligning whatever research, whatever trigger I saw, and just from there, it's just kinda that that normal pitch from there. Gotcha. And so you're at that point, you're pulling in the research and all of that stuff? Yep. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Like, as soon as soon as possible, whether it's a call or an email or whatever it is, like, as soon as possible, I wanna make it painfully obvious to that person. I'm on the 50 yard line. I'm not I'm not back in my one one yard line here. There's some context here. There's some research here. This isn't just, like, some random person calling out of the blue completely with no context here. And, like, as soon as possible, I get into that. So then, like because, otherwise, if you don't, then you increase the chances that that person hangs up on you or, like, most of the time on a cold call, they're just trying to get you off the phone. Like, they're just like, oh, you know, you know, I make up some BS reason why they can't take that call. I'm I'm in a meeting, you know, when, obviously, they're not they're not in a meeting. You know? The other way that I'll sometimes open a cold call is I just say, hey. This is Jeremy over at leadIQ, and I shut up. Jeremy, one thing I wanna ask about because I run into this also where you're calling the cell phone and it may or may not be the right person. Like, you cold call Arman and it's a woman's voice. What are you actually saying? Like, I actually wanna know what do you say when they pick up the phone? Are you just saying, hey. Is this Arman? Or what's that, like, first part of the call when you're confirming the person sound like? I usually actually, like, assume that it is the right person, but I don't reveal my company yet. Because if you say, hey. Is this Nick? They're gonna be like, oh, they don't know who I am. Oh, it's a sales call. Let me get this guy off the phone. You know? So that's why I if it is a man, I'm calling a man, it's the it's the right gender, I'll assume that it's the right person. And I'll say, hey, Nick. How's it going? And then if they correct me and they're like, oh, this isn't this isn't Nick, like, then I'll be like, alright. Sorry. Wrong number. Get off the phone. But, like, if I'm just like, hey. Hey, Nick. Yeah. Yeah. How's it going? You know? Then I got the right person, then I reveal this Jeremy over at lead IQ, and I'll call Blue. You know? So that's just kinda how that works. One thing that I've done is when I call a cell phone and I'm not sure who it is, and I'm like, hey, Armand. And they're like, no. This is Jeremy. One of the things I'll do is be like, shoot. I was trying to get in touch with Armand Farot because I don't know. Maybe 10% of the time, the person's like, oh, yeah. His number is x. I get called all the time for that person. So that's one thing that I've done. Jeremy, one thing that you and I were talking about on the prep call was the sustained prospecting efforts and the idea that if you reach out to somebody one time, your chances of getting a response are much, much lower than if you're consistent. So I think you you threw out eight as, like, the magic number for for Outreach. And sometimes it can be hard filling eight touches with substantive personalized content. And if some I'm I'm curious, like, what are you actually putting in that outreach over a span of time? I did see a study that Heather Morgan with SalesFolk did on number of emails to get a response, and oftentimes takes at least eight. And if you don't email at least eight times, you're giving up too early and you're missing out on opportunities. But what do you say in those eight emails? So, you know, I I mentioned a few a few things. Like, if, like, they use SalesLoft or Outreach, for example. One email, I'm gonna send them that gift that shows how the integration works. Another email, I could send a screenshot of a rep. There's I could I have screenshots from reps from both companies, SalesLoft and Outreach, talking about the success that they've had using using our tool. If they have one of those tools, you know, I could send them the screenshot that says, hey. Our integration with SalesLoft slash Outreach is smooth as butter. And it's got the little butter thing in there. You know? So that's three emails right there just based on that thing that they have that now if I go to that person's LinkedIn profile, oh, I see that we have a mutual connection. Maybe it's Zach Barney who's been a customer of ours at multiple companies before. Hey. So that's that's a fourth email, you know, based on that mutual connection. You know, if there's a job posting that I see, and I can reference something in the job posting and and align that to our value prop. That's five emails. Trying to think other things. Oh, yeah. Like, account history, whether it's previous opportunity that we had with them or if there was people from that company that had signed up on our website, signed up for accounts, that's another email. Is, oh, you did you know that, mister VP of sales, you know that you've had four people from your team sign up on our website trying to, like, use an account with us in the, like, last three months? And I would not only would say that, but I'll screenshot. I'll send them a screenshot of the page in our system that shows that user data. And I, you know, I send that to them. So that's what? We're up to six emails? And then maybe the last two, I might kind of use it like semi templates or something. But Alright, Jeremy. So we talked about a lot of good prospecting habits. One of the things we haven't talked about is the bad habits to break. And so we ask it in every episode. If there was one bad habit that every rep had to break today, what would it be in your opinion? Focus less on just, like, the metrics. And, like, if you're at a company that and I I used to I've been at companies before where it's all about 100 dials a day. You know, you get to send a 100 emails. Slow down to speed up. I think the one thing that, you know, most reps, like, are doing wrong is they're just focusing too much on the numbers of calls and emails that they're making and just going through the motions. So don't just go through the motions. Don't just focus on how many calls and emails. Really have some more strategy and purpose behind it. And then even don't worry if, you know, ask for forgiveness later. If your manager yells at you, oh, you didn't make a 100 dials or you didn't send a 100 emails today. Stay with it and trust the process and you'll start to get some better results and then you can show those results to your manager. I love it. And anything you wanna plug, I think I have a sense of what you probably wanna plug. But before we jump off You know, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. Just put Jeremy, l e v, in LinkedIn. Search me on there. You'll see the goofy guy with, with the flamingo suit on there, and you can connect with me on there. And and, yeah, if you wanna learn about lead leadIQ, you can hit me up on there as well. Jeremy, for somebody who says I cut all the pleasantries, you're being extremely humble here. So everybody go hit up Jeremy, follow him on LinkedIn, and go buy some lead IQ from him. Alright? Great company and a great man. And stay hang on for a thirty second recap email, not a thirty second. It's a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Alrighty. Your top four takeaways from this episode include, number one, so you got this shared Google Drive of screenshots segmented by competitor, segmented by customer size, and all you're gonna do is you're gonna compile your customer screenshots of the people who love your product, and when you find somebody who's on ZoomInfo or any of your competitors, you put it in that email. Number two, skip the pleasantries in your emails. Don't be saying, hey, how's your day going in all the fluff? Say, hey, I see you're on this competitor. Here's a screenshot or a GIF, and get out of there, and do that eight times over the course of your sequence. Number three, you gotta know what to look for before you look for it. First, try to go on Salesforce, see if you can work the account. Second, from there, you know what the triggers are to buy, and they tend to not be, oh, you went to the same college as me. So stack rank those triggers and get after them. And then number four, when you're opening your cold calls, we've heard this a million times, but Jeremy's opener is, hey. It's Jeremy from leadIQ. Is it cool if I explain the reason for my call in under thirty seconds? Nick, how can people help us out here? Armand, I am becoming rating and KPI obsessed, and it was kind of a bittersweet day for me. We got our first one star rating. We have about 205 star ratings, two four star ratings, and one one star. So I wanna balance that out, make sure the ratio is good. So if you haven't rated the show, please give us a rating this week. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes of Presidents Club.
