## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk. I'm here with my host, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the one and only Chris Von Huen. He was formerly a stud over at Xerox, and now he is one of the first AEs over at Prodigal doing a serious enterprise sales motion. Nick, why should people listen? So there's a void. There's a gap between when you finish your demo and when the customer signs a contract, especially in big enterprise sales. And Chris has this tool, a transformation plan. And a couple other really interesting things that help get you from great demo to great closed one contract. Three, two, one. Transformational episode. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Chris. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Done, Dale. So first one is running a jobs to be done customer interview. What was like life prior to your product? What was life like with using your product? How would they sell that to someone else that has a similar title to them? Beautiful. What's number two? Number two. If If your customers don't use the words, stop putting them in your marketing and sales material. You 100% need to sound like your customers. So if they don't say, like, decimate, do not use decimate in any freaking language. They need to be able to self identify. They can't do that if you sound like some weird foreign entity. So always use your customer's language. I love it. What's number three, Chris? Third one is use a transformation plan, which this is basically saying, hey. What does your current and future state look like? Who's involved? Who's signing? Milestones, success criteria, what what to expect from trial, how does pricing work. Hey, Chris. Could you double click on this transformation plan? Step by step, what goes into that plan? Yeah. Of course. So from a transformation plan perspective, the goal is to have one document that literally summarizes everything. And you're using this to keep everyone on track because we know that we have, like, five to eight to 10 buyers in a buying process, especially when you're getting into an enterprise deal. So the first part of the transmission plan is compelling reason. Why on god's great on earth are you actually talking today? Right? They have 10,000,000 priorities. Your priority either one through three. Why are you priority one through three? So it's like why you, why now? That's the compelling reason. That's the first section. Second section then is current state. So what are the challenges that they're going through? That's forcing them to go look for a solution? You wanna get the emotions, and you wanna quantify it as well because that's gonna help with your ROI. Then you wanna go to future state. So assuming they've gotten your product, what does success look like? What does that feel like? What does that look like, again, from a numerical perspective? Because that's gonna give you your gap of current state versus future state. Make sure you have enough pain to actually go on that whole journey with you. After that, you're gonna have milestones. What are the typical steps and processes within your sales cycle? And you need to align that with their timeline to make sure that they have now cocreated that timeline with you so you can hold each other mutually accountable to it. After that, you're gonna share how your pricing works, so commercial levers and minimums, if that's applicable for you. And then you're gonna look at the buying committee. So, again, who's involved, what's their roles, and also who's the agreement signer or contract signer, however you wanna frame it. You let them know if you're doing a trial, what to expect with the trial outline. So steps, expectations, your test driving, you're not going crazy off of that because your teams are gonna hate you, and your bills are never gonna close. And then the last piece is this that you mentioned that you're gonna parallel path commercial terms while you're doing your trial. That way you keep your deal velocity going. Chris, how do you introduce this to the customer? Because I'm sure you can't just, like, show up at a discovery call and be like, hey. Here's the document. We're going through all this today. Like because there's a cocreation element. So you can you talk about how you tee that up and and introduce it to the customer? Yeah. So it's very strategic. So I do my discovery first, then I do my demo. I don't do disco and demos. I absolutely hate them, and I'm not a fan of them. So discovery is one meeting. Demo is a second meeting. Then once you've joined, like, your vendor onboarding, I have actually a workflow meeting since my product is very workflow specific. So that's a little unique to my product, but we need to understand your workflows. Then I actually put everything I've heard from those three meetings together in a transformation plan. So this is prior to the trial starting. And I sit down with them, and I then walk them through. Here's everything I heard from you. Now I'm gonna have some gaps in my transformation plan. So this is a great way if you're using, like, Medpick or anything like that. Transformation plan is essentially Medpick, just customer facing document. You can basically cover any holes that you have, and then you can get alignment again and get them to buy in saying, yes. That's right. So I introduce it at that point from before the trial, and then we start having, like, a UI trial kickoff. So I essentially just use this plan once, but I always give them the link to the document, and then they can make any comments or edits as well. So it's an interactive document. To be honest, most people don't make edits, but, actually, for some of my enterprise deals, I'm actually getting a lot more edits on that, and that's telling me that we have buy in or maybe there was misalignment. So I can make sure that I'm running my deals well and effectively. Chris, you mentioned three types of meetings. I think it was a discovery meeting, a workflow meeting, which I've never heard of in one other. Could you give us a sense of what entails or what goes into those meetings prior to the transformation plan? Yeah. Of course. So discovery is your typical, hey. What's your world it's like world building. What are you struggling with today? Can I solve it? Do we have enough, like, synergy here where this is actually a viable solution for you? Right? So typical pain. What are you going through? Get the details. Get the confirmation. Just make sure that there's no substance there. So that's why, like, in my meeting invites, I always say, like, the first, like you know, I was putting a general targeted outcomes, but from a discovery, it's just, like, gain consensus on mutual fit. So that's really the whole point of a discovery in my world is I'm qualifying you, you're qualifying me. Then I go to the demo, and I demo based off of the main points that you cared about from the discovery. And I always ask each person that's in the meeting, unless it's, like, 20 people, then you just use the chat, what are the top three things you wanna get out of this demo to ensure it's a good use of your time? And that way, I'm kinda reconfirming what you've already shared with me in the discovery. So then you might actually tell me something different that you didn't share with me in the discovery. Right? So now I'm kinda building a little bit more. Run through the demo. Again, gain consensus on mutual fit. Okay. Did you see what I showed? Do you feel like that would adequately address the challenges that you shared with me? And is there enough interest to move forward, or is it just an interesting product that you wanted to learn more? I always give them that easy out. Right? Because I want them to sell themselves on what they saw valuable in the solution. Again, write all that down. That goes into all of your building. That's your sales marketing material plus you making sounding like them. They use particular keywords to refer to agents as whatever collectors or customer success. I don't care the language. You're gonna pick up all that nuances and you put that across some of your documents. Then prior to actually starting the trial, because I have a workflow product, it's a speech analytics tool. So for quality assurance and operations teams, they're mining the conversations that their collectors are making, figuring out where those compliance issues and where they can collect more cash and perform better. So think of it essentially like Gong or Chorus, but specifically for the collection industry. So I need to understand how are you doing these workflows today because we're gonna replicate them within our platform. Right? I'm gonna show you how you're gonna get your savings. I'm gonna show you how you're gonna reduce your compliance exposure. I'm gonna show you how you're gonna collect more cash. So that's that workflow meaning. Super nuanced, super nitty gritty, like step one, step two, step three. And then what you can't do today that you wish you could do because there's a lot of power within the platform. So it's not just replicating what you're doing today. It's also leveling you up to that that next level. Then I take all that information from those three meetings, discovery, demo, workflow, put it all into the transformation plan, which is essentially just saying, hey. I heard you from these three meetings. Here's what I understood. What did I misunderstand? And let's get anything aligned or fill up any holes I may have for a missed question or whatever. You know, run your med pick, your sales methodology, and capture kind of all those missing pieces prior to the track. So, Chris, I've I've seen people do something similar with this workflow meeting. I think I've even watched not watched one of Nick's demos, but overheard one of them where he will have the customer driving the demo, and he'll literally say, click here. Now click here. Is that what you're doing? Are you driving and literally asking them, where do you go from here? Where do you go from here? How do you actually run a workflow demo? Yeah. So that's actually our UI kickoff. That's when we're doing our trial. Then we actually use their data. They hop in and they drive and we voice over. So the workflow would just be like, hey, Nick. Help me understand. Like, how do you choose calls to QA? Like, what what's your process? And he's like, well, Chris, I go into my dialer. I grab random call recordings. I look for things that are over two to five minutes because I think that's something of interest. I listen to it, then I have an Excel based scorecard, and I'm manually filling out everything. And I'm like, so it sounds like you're just kinda randomly hoping that you found something of value. And, you know, basically, you spend a lot of time kind of at levels one or two. So I build a pyramid. Like, level one is you pulling your call recordings. Level two is scoring. Level three is business insights. And we wanna get our prospects to business insights, right, or business decisions. So I'm like, my goal is to jump you to level three. So I'm just trying to understand what's prohibiting you from getting to level three. So it's not showing a platform in the workflow meeting. It's literally just step by step, walk me through exactly what you're doing today, and then I'm gonna ask a lot of questions so I can show you how we can automate, replicate that, and take it to the next level within our platform. Chris, I wanna jump back even before this transformation plan thing happens because it sounds like the gateway to the customer buying in to the transformation plan and going through a lot of the stuff with you is there's gotta be a halfway decent demo, and they feel like, okay. This may be able to help us. So can you talk me through some of your best practices for when you get into that demo? I like that question you mentioned. What else do you do intentionally? So I speak about demos in terms of workflows. I think one of the biggest mistakes I see reps make is just a product dump, and they don't think like their prospects. So I think like a VP of ops. I think like a manager of QA. If I'm gonna be in this platform, what the hell am I gonna go do? So walk it through in workflows that I can relate to my current world so I can see how much better this is. I know kind of what their worlds already look like. I'm just reconfirming that my general understanding of the industry is true to them and then understanding the nuances that are unique to them so I can then replicate that. So let's say I got, you know, the VP of operations and I have, like, a QA analyst. Like, we're completely different on the spectrum. So senior management usually wants reporting and insights. Right? Like, think like a VP. They really care about high level what's going on in my business, trend reporting, outliers, things like that. Like, they need to manage to kind of that level. So then I'm like, okay. Typically, that's gonna be the reports and and the trend analysis, and that's actually gonna flow into the output that the analyst does. So in my mind that I try to connect, okay, VP needs the high level executive summary. I'm just gonna show quickly how we get to that summary. Touch on that summary. Not spend too much time on it because we just need to essentially check the box that it's there, that you can drive insights off of it, and move. And sometimes if I don't get everything covered, then I will offer to do, like, quick little videos of maybe some of the key features and send that as a follow-up personally to them saying, hey. I know I couldn't cover this feature functionality you're looking for. I just wanna make you a quick video so you can understand it. If we wanna reconnect on that for, like, ten, fifteen minutes, let me know. We can have kinda that one off. So I'll break them out if I can't get to it. But if not, then I'm just gonna look for some of those key pieces. And, again, put my hat on as an executive. Put my hat on as an analyst. What are the key things they should care about? Let's make sure I deliver that. Everything else, make quick two to three minute videos. You're good to go. I know you do some more enterprise sales motions as well where you might have five, six, seven, eight people involved in a sale. On average, are you doing one demo with the entire room? Are you doing multiple smaller demos and then a big room demo? How many calls showing software do you typically have in a typical deal cycle? Yeah. So usually when it's enterprise and let's define enterprise. Let's say it's a $100,000 or more kinda deal because that's typically at least what I don't know if you guys are seeing different level for kinda enterprise, but we'll just cut the line there. So 100 k and more. Typically, it's about two to three demos. So you do the first demo with, like, the main person that you got. Right? Hopefully, that's, like, your ICP, and that's a good champion for you. But you gotta do the demo for them just to say, hey. Is it worth me sticking my neck out on the line? Then they usually bring in their boss and so you do a demo for the boss. And then the boss is like, okay. Bring the squad. So, basically, it could be about three demos because you gotta remember, you gotta get their buy in first because they're speaking on your behalf. That's their reputation. Now they need to go run it by their management and get permission that, hey. This is something of interest. I agree. You know, you're executive sponsor. Now the executive sponsor is gonna rally all the other parties that this product could potentially affect and make sure that there's group consensus that we see value across the organization. So typically for me, enterprise deals and doing at least two to three demos. Where a lot of people tend to screw up is they go so you went from the champion to the boss to the squad, which is the right way to do it because you're winning one group of people at a time. A lot of people go from a discovery with the champion to a demo with the squad. And now it's eight v one and you're getting blown up. Like, Christy, I see you shaking your head and getting an ulcer just me saying that. How do you No. How do you prevent that from happening? Yeah. So what I typically say is, like, look. You know, I wanna make sure like, especially when it's your champion, and you don't really know your ICP. Like, I know my ICP backwards and forth. So I know when I get to this person within a company, they're the main ones that've gotten all the value because I've done all those customer interviews, and and and I know my buyers, and I know the other organization the other groups that are part of it. So I say, look. I like, I know you're gonna be kind of the main person here. I just wanna get kind of your buy off and your blessing first before we go for the larger groups. I know some people are like, oh, just bring everybody the first time. Well, here's what happens. They have no context. They got no idea. Your champion hasn't done a little internal selling for you, so it's a very awkward demo. Right? And I'm sure, like, we've all been on them too. Like, I've been on them. Like, it's awkward. They're like, I don't even know why I'm here. I just got the invite two minutes ago. I'm like, awesome. So this is not gonna really jive and flow well. So I just say, like, in order to ensure the best success possible, it's really beneficial just to have you, you know, do the demo first. You can give a little context to your colleagues so that way they're not just just cold out of the blue, getting a random invite from a random guy they don't know, and then we can keep building it that way. So that's normally how I kinda lay the context if that situation comes up. You're doing it in a way where you're telling your champion, hey. I know you're going to be my champion, and I want you to feel comfortable with what we're doing before we bring everybody else in. That's one way to empower your champion. One of the most important things in an enterprise cycle is having a good relationship with one point person at the company. Do you have any other best practices for building that relationship or enabling your champion? Yeah. I think you really gotta figure out what do they have to gain or lose. Like, again, put yourself in their shoes. Right? What do they stand to gain by getting this piece in? What do they stand to lose by keeping the status quo? Right? Because, like, they're aware at this point that status quo is not good. Right? It works, but there's a difference between working and and being good. Right? Many things work that aren't good. So I think you really need to understand, like, what's in it from them as far as, like, the value and benefits it can bring to the organization because they're speaking on your behalf, not third reputation. After the demo is done, I usually walk high level. Like, hey. Here's our typical sales process. We're gonna do a b c x y z. Boom boom boom boom boom. Here's all the support you're gonna get from me because I've been in your shoes. Like, I used to be a financial analyst. I use that all the time. Like, I used to be a financial analyst, so I've done the ROI calculations. I've done the internal pitch and selling. I have a whole process deck already built out for you. We're gonna walk step by step through it. So I just actually walk them through the rest of the process after the demo, letting them know that they're gonna have guidance every step of the way. And just ask, like, does that align with how you buy software? And then they'll tell me yes, no. I'm like, okay. Does that sound like you're gonna be supported in a way that you're looking for? But I kinda ask in a little more indirect way because no one's really gonna say, like, I'm like, hey. You know, what's your fears and concerns? Like, who this is gonna be blunt, honest, and be like, oh, blah. So, I mean, again, it's not how we communicate in our personal lives. Why don't we do it in our professional lives? So I think that's where walk them through. Let them know that they're gonna get support every step of the way, and then ask them, does that align with the way that they're buying or what they're looking for from you? And they'll come back and tell you yes or no. So, Priti, you can sort of swag your way through, like, a mid market sale, but it's very clear you have an enterprise sales process. But you came from Xerox, and, like, you don't have a traditional enterprise SaaS background at all. How did you learn all this stuff about, like, the transformation plan and whatnot? Did you just listen to podcast? Did you download a transformation plan template and then just use it for prodigal? Like, how'd you actually figure this stuff out? Yeah. So funny thing is, like, Xerox is actually very enterprise sales because I had deals north of a 100,000. You know what I mean? So it's the same freaking thing, if not harder because I'm delivering physical equipment, and you have to go get leases from banks. So that's a hell of a process right there. But just in general so the transformation plan came from mutual action plans that I saw from enterprise sales, but I thought that they were very dry and boring. Right? And then I looked at Medpick. So m e d I p I c c or however it is, like, the full blown one. I looked at that and said, how can I put that into a Word document that's customer facing that makes sure we get everything? So I literally took the mutual action plans plus Medpick, blended them together in a transformation plan, and then each company I've been at. So I've started using them at Xerox. That was the first time I started using them. And then here at product, I just took it and kind of continue to modify and improve it. But it's just a Google Doc. You make you copy over your prior transformation plan. And, typically, again, like, when you know your ICP, the challenges are essentially gonna be very similar. There'll just be subtle nuances and things. So then it's just kinda like you can kinda reuse a lot of the information that you already have because I mean, think about your product. You usually solve, like, top three really compelling pains. Right? Like, if someone says they solved 10, I'm like, BS. There's three that usually make it or break it. So focus on those three. That's usually what you're gonna hear anyways, and you can add some subtle nuances and colors to customize it for each prospect. But, again, like, 80% of it is a rehashing of all the prior ones that you've done. So what do you do? I guess there's times that the transformation plan gets, like, knocked off kilter. Like, they've communicated a timeline to you, and then that timeline gets blown up. Or they've said, alright. Here's sort of the steps that we have involved in this. And then they just start, like, throwing stuff that's not part of that original plan. What do you do when the customer sort of calls an audible? Yeah. I mean, I think two part question. Like, that's that's why it's so important to have that scope meeting and really figure it out, but they don't know what they don't know. Like, if they've never bought your platform before, you need to understand that. So if they're switching from a competitor, the scope shouldn't really shift at all. You should not have any scope creep because they're already using competitor. They already know what they like and don't like. Boom. So that, I don't really foresee scope creep, and I would actually push back harder on them because they're already using a similar product. If it's a first time buyer that's never bought your product, they don't know what they don't know until they get into the platform. So then I usually give a little more leeway there, and I just make sure that the requests are reasonable. So if they come back and ask for 10 things, I'm like, look. The way we keep this complimentary is we're looking to check the major rocks. So a major rock was this. You know, it was whatever. Accuracy. Another one was automation. The third one is reporting. Now you're adding, like, maybe a sub rock under reporting. But, like, help me understand, like, why is that, you know, this extra feature really gonna make it or break it? If you've checked the major rock on reporting, then making another report is just time. Right? Time and resources. So I kinda push back and really ask them, like, what are we truly validating? And is it new, or is it just a slight pivot from something we've already done? And a lot of the times, it really is just a slight pivot from what we've already done, and that's where we can agree, like, look. To keep the trial complimentary, we're checking the big rocks. We have it noted down that we need to go make this for you. I'll make that complimentary once you sign go live with us. Can Can we say that that's a fair agreement? And I think just having that candid conversation or they'll tell me, like, you know what, Chris? That's nonnegotiable. Like, I definitely need to have this. Okay. Help me understand why. And then they'll list out exactly the concerns. I'm like, okay. So if we do this, will this then address your concerns? Yes. I just did that, like, two days ago in an email with a prospect. They did ask for a little bit more, and I was like, it was a valid ask. And I'm like, yep. Fair enough. We gotta deliver on that because you're gonna have hesitation in signing. So I don't want that. And so this time, we did it. But I think you did that one off conversation and then make a judgment call. You moved into the transformation plan, and the trial's gone well. And they said, alright. Chris, you got a deal. Send us the contract. Well, you know, the deal's not done yet. They're probably gonna try and negotiate with you. Can you talk through some of your, like, principles and best practices related to negotiating one of these enterprise deals? Yeah. So in my transformation plan, I already have all my commercial levers there. So you send over your list pricing. I know you're gonna ask me for a discount because you always do. It's enterprise. So then I say and, actually, I parallel path my commercial terms and my trial. So day one of trial kicking off, I also send the contract over with all the pricing. And I set a commercial terms negotiation meeting on day 11. So after my second check-in, I set my commercial terms meeting. I've had two seconds that has a good indicator of how successful or not the trial is going. Right? And that's usually at that point where that decision maker will wanna sit down with you because then they have enough skin in the game and enough feedback to really make a decision. So then it says going over that, and if they're gonna start asking for discounts, you then it's, Todd Capone's transparency sales. So he has, like, four or five levers. I've made different levers for my own business, but we get the principle. You want a discount? Cool. Then if you want give me the percentage discount you want. 30%? Great. I can give you 5% for an additional year. So if you can do a three year contract, that's 10% off. If you can pay up one year upfront, that's another 5% off. If we can agree to sign by this date, that's 2.5 so I can get you roughly to 17.5. You said yes to everything. Boom. We then reconfirm all that in an email, and we move forward. So I think you just gotta you gotta contain your negotiation conversation. I think that's the biggest mistake I see a rep make is they just start giving up price, and they get nothing in return. You know, they counter it. Because then you gotta really see, like, how serious are they on the discount? Are they just asking to ask? Here's what I say before you can get into the negotiation conversation and get that nuances. I say, look. The thing that I ask for you is let me know that I'm your vendor of choice and tell me why I'm your vendor of choice. That way I can sure align it because if we're just kicking tires before we've said that you're before you told me I'm the vendor of choice, to be frank, I don't see that being a good use of everyone's time, and it's just not resulted in successful completion of, you know, a sale. So I need to make sure that we're your vendor of choice. And then at that point, that gives me the leverage I need to go fight for you and make sure we get the best terms possible. Well, Chris, final question for you is this. So we've talked about a ton of really good things that folks can incorporate into how they sell, but now we gotta flip that on its head and talk about a bad thing. So I'm curious to learn from you. Do you see a bad habit that a lot of sales reps exhibit that you think they need to stop doing because it hurts them more than it helps? Yeah. I think it's it's kind of the sales desperation where you don't wanna dequeue and walk away from a deal. Like, I I feel like we get into the deal, like, every deal is gonna work. Everyone's gonna sign. Like, even if you don't fit my ICP, even if, like, it's a fringe use case, we don't really do. Like, honestly, the best thing you can do is stay in your lane. Like, I chased a couple deals that were not within our ICP that were just not like, they were on a fringe use case, burned through a lot of time. They didn't sign. So I think that's the number one thing. Like, stand in lane, know your ICP. If they're not a fit, DQ early so you can go find companies that are because we we don't get time back. So if you know it's not gonna work, I understand you wanna sign everybody. It's not reality. Find people who are your fit, DQ quick, and just you gotta let it go. Like, you gotta let it go as you go crazy. Beautiful. Chris, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? I'd say, you know, if anyone wants to reach out, just connect with me on LinkedIn. That's just the easiest way to get a hold of me. And, you know, happy to to chat with them if they have questions or they want me to explain something a little bit better that that we showed on the podcast. Everybody, go connect with Chris. Send him a nice InMail or a connection request, and stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Chris Von Heughan include, number one, ask each person one by one in a demo what are the top three things they need to get out of this call. Number two, you've got the champion demo, the boss demo, and the squad demo, and they need to flow in that order. Do not go from the champion discovery to the squad demo. Number three, you can take the mutual action plan and a mix of that and Medpick, and that gives you your transformation plan, focusing on everything from their current state to their future state to exit criteria for the trial to running commercial terms in parallel. And then lastly, number four, on that note, you have to parallel path commercial terms. The moment you have a trial, you should be sending them that contract with pricing and the options outlined.
