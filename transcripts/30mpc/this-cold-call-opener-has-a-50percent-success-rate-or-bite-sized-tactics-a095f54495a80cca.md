## Transcript

There's this idea, especially by people that don't use PBOs, that once they say no, the call is over. Right? Mhmm. The call is only over if they hang up, which, by the way, they're probably gonna do anyway if you don't use the permission based off. Right? So for example, someone says no. So my immediate go to, and this is just built in my brain now, is like, is that because you hate cold calls or you just hate me? Yeah, like, just just right and and again, you can be, like, quite deliberate with this. You can even go more emotional. You could be like, is that because you hate cocos or just salespeople? Again, and this is crucial because people do not wanna hate. No one wants to be hateful. So they immediately will tend to distance themselves. And in fact, over 50% of the time, I'll they'll they'll be like, no, no, no, I don't hate you. I just don't like cold calls. And then my rebuttal is like, okay. When you say that, you hate old cold calls or just the bad ones? And then already, I've kind of delivered the fact that this is a good cold call. Right? And and at this point, another 50% are turning into, like, okay, gone. What is it about? And then if they go, like, oh, I really hate all cold calls, and then I'm gonna hit them one more time, it's gonna, I promise I'll make this the least boring one you've got. Did you wanna hear me out? And if it's not relevant, you'll never hear my weird accent again. And this in The US works so well because you can say, you're never gonna hear my New York accent. You're never gonna hear my Californian accent. And you for 49 state, as long as you don't target your own state, it just works all the time. Giulio, I wanna bring up an objection that you're probably getting from sellers all the time. We also talk about this concept of being disarmingly blunt and saying some of these ridiculous things to break the pattern of the corporate drone that is telemarketing. And whenever we talk about it, every once in a while, you'll get someone who's like, no. But, like, I'm calling engineering leaders or CISOs or senior people may expect a certain level of professionalism, or I'm calling into certain parts of Europe where if you're overly casual, like, that's a total turn off for them. You're literally European yourself. And so Yeah. How do you respond to a seller who thinks that showing that much personality walks the line between being unprofessional? For the audience that's listening to this, I want you to burn something in your head. It's very, very easy to reject or say no to a salesperson. It's very hard to reject a human being. And this is why this works so well because all of a sudden, you're not a salesperson, you're a human being. And that's the part that really is gonna hit the most. And that moment in which you engage them, hey, I'm not a salesperson, I'm a human, It's just so hard for them to then turn around and be like, okay. And so they that's the real part to interrupt. So that's in the in the simple psychological way. But then, like, the funniest part is that I've got a ton of of Cochise in Germany and Switzerland. And I've heard Germany's really, really different. Right? But that's the thing. Everyone was like, oh, but, you know, your staff will never work in Germany. I'm like, Why not? Well, German people don't like to have fun. I'm like, Really? Or is it just that you're not trying to make jokes to them? And that's the crazy part in Germany, because everyone is so serious, but do you think these people don't have comedy? Of course they bloody do. Yeah. They laugh like everyone else. It's just the humor is a bit more direct, so you gotta be more direct with them. Right? So I think, yeah, it's I I'm yet to find, like, the only problems I have seen with this approach from the statistical empirical evidence is when you're targeting people whose level of language is not non native. So for example, when I was cold calling into Dubai, and they're not native English speakers, and then it's difficult because they're not getting it. Right? They don't get the sarcasm, they don't get the humor as easy. So in that case, I would be a in Dubai, I had to, like, be a lot more, like, direct with how I was doing my calls. But apart from that, if you're calling Germans in German, if you're calling Italian in Italian, all of this, I I tested across all areas of Europe and Northern America, and it works. And, again, if it's a bit more the financial sectors, I think about banking. It's really hard. Like, I think engineers are are great. Banking, like, high level banking, very difficult, for example, compared to level of serious. But, again, the as long as the objection is, like, is no. It could be is it because you hate cold calls, or is it just my voice? I mean, you don't have to make it sound funny. You can be very serious. Is it? Did I just use eight cold calls, or or is it just my voice, or was my opener that bad? Right? Again, if you you don't Your tone will make it more playful, so I think you can disarm that, and I'm yet to find a place where this type of responses hasn't worked.
