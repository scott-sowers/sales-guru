## Transcript

Every time you discount in a negotiation, you're literally throwing part of your commission back into the trash. And smart seasoned prospects know the things to say and what to do to chip away at your price over one, two, three, four calls. Arman and I have spent our careers selling to some of the toughest, stingiest buyers out there. Today, we're gonna take you through the eight toughest negotiation battles that he and I have been in and the lessons that we learned from those battles to help you negotiate better and keep more of your hard earned commission check. So this first one actually comes from when I was literally closing my first 6 figure deal. So we were literally a nine employee company, and the biggest deal we had ever sold was a 45 k deal at the time. And so one of our investors made this intro to the super hot real estate tech company that we had no business talking to in the tens and tens and tens of thousands of employees. And, eventually, we got a verbal commit from the CEO that they wanted to roll this thing out. The problem is we literally hadn't quoted them yet, and our pricing chart literally did not go up to 50,000 employees. Mhmm. And so we go back to our investor and we're like, dude, how much should we quote this guy? Like, our pricing chart doesn't even scale that high. He's like, just take your per employee price and, like, scale it up to 50,000 employees. And so we took the per employee price, and I look at him. I'm like, dude, that's $720 that I'm literally about to quote this guy. He's like, they're not gonna bad. No. I just throw it in front of him. And at this point, the CEO had already sent his team to do the marching orders, collect the quote, and implement this next week. And so I go in front of the champion. I'm like, alrighty, Daniel. This is your all in cost for the entire year. It includes all of your implementation services. $720,000. And he just looks at me like I'm the biggest moron he's met in his life. And he's like, do you realize that that is the combination of every other tool in our HR tech stack combined times two? And I'm like, the value of compensation is priceless. And my CEO is just looking at me like, what are you doing, dude? I can't believe we just put the 720 k quote in. And so, eventually, I put the tables back on him, and I'm like, well, what did you have in mind? Because I'm not gonna go and start to negotiate against myself. That's one thing I had learned in past deals. And so eventually what happens is he comes back with a number and he's like, look, this is absolutely the most I can ever pay. I will not pay any more than $100,000. And in my mind, if this guy closed for 60, I would have been stoked. Biggest deal ever. And so the key there is if you're gonna anchor someone, anchor them high. Mhmm. And then give them the opportunity to come back. There is no cost to anchoring high. A lot of times people think that you're gonna scare your prospects away. But as long as you say, hey. If this doesn't work for you, there are ways we can skinny this thing down or we can scale it up. What did you have in mind? Mind? And I can tell you what we can actually do. Nine times out of 10, they will come back with a higher number than if you just discount it against yourself. Alright. So this next one is actually probably one of the proudest negotiations that I've had where, like, I I held my ground. We're selling to this pretty big law firm in New Jersey, and I was working with the COO of the law firm. And Today's show is brought to you by Texas, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Throughout, like, the deal process, process, the demos, the meetings, talking about implementation, like, they were eating up what we were putting down. And every single signal, the the the questions they were asking, the people they were bringing to meetings, I was like, we're gonna win this deal. Like, you know when you're gonna win a deal. We were gonna win this deal. Right at the very end, we're, like, right towards the finish line about to send them a contract for the first time. I get on the phone actually, I got on a Zoom meeting with the COO of the law firm. And she's like, Nick, you know, we really love your product. I'd love getting to work with you, but I gotta let you know something. And and she reaches she reaches under her desk, and she pulls out a stuffed animal coyote. And she's like, I gotta let you know we're we're also talking to your competitor, Coyote Analytics, and they sent me this stuffed doll. And I'll be honest. They do pretty much everything that you do, and they're half the cost. So what can you do for me? And I'm like, oh, shit. Because there was no way I was gonna be able to get to what half of what our price was. Like, literally, my my CRO would fire me if I closed a deal at half the cost I had quoted. And I'm sitting there, and I'm like, shoot. And I start to think for a second. And I'm, like, sort of quiet, and she's, like, sitting there with her eyes. Like, what are you gonna do for me? What kind of discount am I getting? And I'm like, okay. She just said they do everything that we do, and they're half the cost. Like, why wouldn't she take that deal if it's literally the, like, the same product and it's half of what we're charging? So I just said that to her, and I was like, Jennifer, I hate to say this and, like, look. We would really love to work with you all, but if they're doing all of the things that we are, like, if you feel like they have basically the same product and they're half what we cost, I I can't get there. So, honestly, like, you might be better off taking that deal. That's a really, really good deal. A beat goes by. Two beats go by. Three beats go by. She sort of nodded her head, and she's like, yeah. But you guys have that analytics module that just, like it does some of the stuff that they can't, and we really liked your implementation team. Like, I know they're gonna do a really good job on this thing. And she starts listing off all of a sudden the ways that, oh, they can't get the exact same thing down the street. We ended up getting the deal, and I didn't discount a penny. What I learned right there is oftentimes the frame in your negotiations with buyers is you're doing anything to win their business. Oh, I can give you a discount. I can change the billing terms. I can give you some extra seats. And buyers just keep asking, asking, asking, bleeding you dry because you're the needy one. But the second that you say, you know what? Maybe you should go take that deal. You flip the polarity, and it's not you chasing them anymore. They're like, woah. Woah. Woah. No. Look. We do wanna work with you. And I started doing that again and again and again. Anytime someone would be like, I need a 40% discount. I'm like, shit. We look. We can't do that. We would love to work with you, and maybe we can find some ways to, like, get creative here. But, like, if that's what you need, I'm gonna be honest. Like, we're probably not the right fit for you. And when I started just pushing away when I got asked for a discount, things changed, and I kept my status where I was no longer needy. And so and so that just, like, ingrained in my brain. You don't need to be a needy seller who is begging for their business. Alright. So this next one was one of the toughest negotiations I've done in my life. Yeah. So there was this really tough CFO who was running HR at the time, and I was selling compensation software. So oftentimes, you would be negotiating with a fluffy HR leader, but then this, like, rigid CFO jumps on the call. And she just eats me alive one call at a time. So I literally come in, and I'm like, it's gonna be 50 k. And she's like, it's gotta be 20. And I'm like, what the hell? I was like, there's no way we can do 20 k. And, eventually, I start doing some of the things that you talked about where I push her away into the And over three, four, or five calls, eventually, somehow, I'm like, look. We can get a four in front of this, but that's it. And she's like, fine. I can do 40 k. And I'm like, hell, yeah. I got away with the toughest negotiation ever with a 20% discount. Mhmm. And then she goes, great. And I want monthly payments. And I was like, here was the problem, is a lot of times when people get into a negotiation, they think that price is the only thing that people ask for. But a smart negotiator, they negotiate one meaty slice at a time. So you might have heard this analogy that happens where it's like, if you have a jar, for example, and I fill up the jar with ping pong balls. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And I ask you, is there any more room in this jar? You'll say, no. No. Of course, there's not. Right? And then what do I do? I pour sand in the jar. Mhmm. And sand is like the billing terms after you've got all the price. And then I'll be like, is there any more room in there? You'll be like, no. There's no more room. Guess what? Then they pour water into the jar. Mhmm. Right? Mhmm. And there's room for water. And the water is like, oh, the extra seats or the product. Mhmm. And so they ask for the things that are the most important to them first, and then they just slice you apart one ask after the next. So whenever you're going into a negotiation, I have this thing that's called you wanna get the full and the final ask. So the full final ask. That is how you get a negotiation done in one cut Mhmm. Is you're like, okay. So you need this to be 20. I'm not saying that we can do this at 20, but there are probably other things you're gonna ask me for. And I need to literally propose a full contract back to my CFO. Mhmm. And if I come back to him three times, he's gonna be like, nope. The first one was the only one you get, and you're gonna be stuck. So you need to tell me if there are any other terms that you are going to ask about on this order form. Yes. And that forces them to do the hard work of going through the contract, and then you can force them to make trade offs Yes. Instead of just getting beaten apart one ask at a time. The way that I would always frame it when I was selling to law firms is I would say, look. Like, I have to go back to my COO and my CFO, and I have to put together a presentation for these people of, like, what you're asking for. And I only get one presentation. And so I need to know all of the things that you're gonna ask for. And so one of the keys here is you can use those people who are not in the room as a way to protect yourself in that negotiation to get that full ask. So this next one is one where I actually closed the deal by letting my CRO convince me to lose the negotiation. I was selling to this law firm in San Diego, and they were using this piece of software that we were gonna be replacing that was getting end of life, meaning the vendor that had supported that software, like, they were like, we're not gonna support this software anymore. Like, we're literally shutting it down. So they had to move to something else. Like, they didn't have another option. And we checked all of their boxes. We were in the right price range for, like, where they needed to be. There were other options that checked their boxes that were, like, eight times our cost that were meant for, like, the multinational 2,000 attorney law firms. And so I knew we had this deal in the bag. Like, everything that they were saying, all the demos, we were gonna win the deal. And so I get on towards the end for, like, a more formal negotiation call with the head of IT systems. And the guy's like, look. We like your products. We wanna do this thing. You're priced at 9 k a month right now. I need you to get down to 8,500, and I'll sign this contract today. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. And I had it was totally within my rights to go to 8,500. I actually could have gone down to, like I think it was, like, 7,500. So I could have done it right there and gotten the deal. But, like, it was fully within my bounds to give that discount, and I didn't wanna do it because I wanted to keep every single penny of my hard earned commission check. And I'm like, hey, man. I'm sorry. Like, the 9 k is the price. Like, can't do anything about it. And he's like, ah, shoot. Like, I really need you to throw something in. I need you to, like, you know, either give us free modules or discount. And I was like, okay. Not gonna do it. So we got off the call. He's like, alright. Well, you know, I'm gonna have to give this some thought. And so we leave. I'm like, alright. Fine. Why do we why do we connect later next week? Thinking that make him sweat a little bit. He'll come back and he'll bend. So we get on another call. No movement. He refuses to budge. And, me too. I'm like, I'm not giving away any more money. And so this goes on for a month. We literally have weekly check-in calls. He won't budge. I won't budge. We're at a standoff. So, again, on a pipe review with my CRO, and we're going through my deals. And he's like, what's going on with this one? I feel like they pretty close to close. Right? And I'm like, yeah. The guy's just like, he's not budging. He wants me to get down to 8,500. I'm at 9 k. And I'm like, but, Steve, I know we don't need to give him a discount, so I'm not gonna move. And Steve's like, hold on a second. And I hear him. We're on the phone. He pulls out his calculator. And he had one of those big calculators that, you know, you can hear him him tap it away, and he's like, Nick, are you aware of how little commission that $500 actually is? It's nothing. He's like, I read never split the difference also. Go give him the $500 discount, get the deal closed, and now you don't have to have a weekly call with this guy for the next two months, and you can use all of that time and mental energy to close other deals. And you will make way more money than that 500 k delta. I'm like, shoot. So I get on the phone. I'm like, hey. Good news. We can give you a discount if you close this thing before the end of the month. And the the head of IT was like, great. Send me the contract. And he literally signed that day. And the lesson I learned was it's funny. We're talking about negotiation, battle stories, and how to keep all your commission check. Sometimes the way to make the most amount of money is to get the deal done and let the buyer win as opposed to trying to cling on to every single penny because you make the most amount of money closing the most amount of dollars, not necessarily winning every single negotiation. There are different types of negotiators in sales. And when I was a VP of sales and buying software, I was the negotiator for sport. In other words, like, I like to just get a win. Like, even if I knew it was the best product, even if I knew I was moving forward with it, I would almost look for reasons to go with the competitor out of spite Mhmm. If this seller would not give me a discount. And so what you need to do when you come up to, like, a stingy buyer like that is you gotta give them a win that hurts you the least. Mhmm. So a lot of times what I would do at Pave is, like, if I got a negotiator for sport, I would, like, make them fight like a dog, but I knew I had their number. I'd be like, okay. Finally. Like, I don't do this for anyone, but I'll waive your implementation fee Yep. Which doesn't pay me any commission. Mhmm. Or I'll give you, like, the quarterly payments, and I'm gonna have to nag my controller for it, and he approves it on every deal. Mhmm. And just by giving them some sort of win, they'll usually ease off. But very few people, especially in software tech sales, are willing to go through at a full list sale. Alright. So this one is the story of old man Ed, the negotiator. So one of my reps was on this deal, and he kept submitting it back to me for approval. Yeah. And, like, every time he would submit it to me, it was a smaller deal size. And I was like, what the hell is going on with him? It was like, every time I get on a call with this guy, he asked me for, like, 5 k more. And so it goes from, like, 50 to 45 to 40 to 35 to 32. And I'm like, dude, like, we can't go below 30 k. Like, you are at bare bottom. Like, it has to be enough. He's like, can you help me out? Can you jump on this call with me? And And so I jump on the call. I'm like, hey, Ed. It's nice to meet you. And he's like, look, Arman. I really like your product, but your competitors are at 20. I'm like, great. What do they do differently? He's like, well, you guys have this. I'm like, great. So the value is 30. He's like, look. The reality is, like, I have a budget, and I can only pay 20. I'm like, Ed, the reality is we've given you 20 k. You are aware that this contract expires at the end of the month. The end of month is seven days. We want your business, but at the same time, you have to make a decision. He goes, nope. I'm gonna think about it. I say, great, Ed. Your contract does expire at the end of the month. I'm gonna move this to a touch point tomorrow, same time. Goodbye. We hop on the next call tomorrow. Guess what? Ed shows up. He's like, yep. You know, I was thinking about this more. Really, the only amount that I can pay today is $22. He's like, can you do that? I'm like, Ed, I really appreciate you as a customer. I want your business, but the lowest we can do is $30. He says, nope. Gotta think about it. I'm like, Ed, I hope you know that your contract is expiring at the end of the month. I have to move this meeting again to the same time tomorrow, and I will see you there. Great. We jump in this rigmarole. Yeah. Four times in a five day work week, I meet with Ed Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and then it gets to Friday. Mhmm. And the end of the month is the weekend. Yep. And I'm like, Ed, I'm like you. I want a deal on everything, but I need you to know this is the best deal that I've approved all month, and I need a decision right now. Otherwise, I have to close this contract at the end of the day. And lo and behold, Ed said, tip of the hat to you. I wish my sales reps did this too, and Ed signed the contract at fullest. So a lot of the times, the battle in negotiation is where reps get themselves into trouble is when they give a discount, they don't get time line in return. Mhmm. But the one thing my rep did right is he gave a discount with a contingency to expire at the end of the month. Yeah. And once we hit rock bottom, I knew that Ed had to make a decision Yeah. At the end of the week. And so the battle in these negotiations is it's like a battle of that internal fortitude is it gets to day 23, day 24. It gets to day 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and you're nervous because the thirtieth of the month is approaching, and you have to stay firm if you have set the expectations because they know exactly what they're doing. No one gets paid to sign early in a negotiation. A savvy negotiator will always sign at the latest day possible. But if you set that exploding deadline, you can hold them to it. Yeah. I think the thing that you did really well in that story is, like, every single call you had, you reminded the buyer. It's not it's it's one thing to say, hey. This expires at the end of the month. It's another to reinforce it again and again and again. And you're gonna feel sort of like a broken record where it's like, I've already told them. Do I need to say it again? But by bringing it up on every single call that, hey. You've got a deal, but it's going to go away here, it becomes real for them. And you're totally right about the savvy buyer thing. It's actually funny. My wife is about to become an Equinox member, and I'm the one who's negotiating the deal. And I'm like, Emma, it's June today. And I'm like, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to stick with LA Fitness for a couple more days. I'm waiting until the very end of the month because I know that's how we get the extra guest passes. That's how we get the store credit. Like, we're literally gonna wait till the end of the month because I know the rep there is gonna start start to sweat. So, yeah, we'll see if I win that one or not. That's another good example of that jar analogy where you're gonna slice up that Equinox rep one ask at a time. Mhmm. The first thing is you get the ping pong balls in the jar, and it's like, that's the price. The second thing is if they can't discount the membership anymore, you start pouring sand in the jar in between the cracks, that's when you start asking for store credit. Mhmm. It's like, okay. They're out of store credit. You got a $200 membership at Equinox. You got $500 in store credit. It's like, now I need 20 guest passes. Yeah. And that's the water that goes in the jar. Right? Just slice them apart in a negotiation one step at a time. Yeah. That's how you get the best deal. Yeah. 100 percent. Alright. So this next one was actually a sponsorship deal that I sold for thirty minutes to president's club. It was a 75 k sponsorship deal. And what I did on this one was customer gets on the call with me. We're customer gets on the call with me. We're right at the end, and they're like, look. We wanna do this thing, but you're priced at 75 k, and we need to get this thing closer to 50 k. And I'm like, okay. Your current proposal, it's got stuff like podcast ads, sponsored webinars, newsletters in there. What do you wanna get rid of to get down there? And the guy's like, oh, well and I could see him sort of get taken aback because he he asked me for a discount, and he thought we were just gonna be negotiating on pricing. And I'm like, look. We can get there if you want. We can get you a cheaper price. We just have to get rid of stuff. And he was like, but, like, we really need those podcast ads. Those are really important. And, the guest on the show that really, really matters, and he's like, may maybe we can get rid of, like, one newsletter, Nick. And I'm like, dude, like, that's maybe $500. Like, you said you need to be at 50, and he's like, gosh. Shoot. And he's like, I don't really wanna get rid of anything. And I'm like, I totally understand. Like, if we need to get to 50, though, we gotta pull stuff out of your contract. And he's like, let me see what I can do. He gets off the call. We got on a call three days later, and he's like, let's move forward at 75 k. And so the old way that I used to do it would be if somebody said, you're at 75 k. I need to get at 50. I used to be like, okay. We'll get rid of ads here. We'll reduce your newsletters here. I think we can change the skews and deliverables over here. And what I learned there was, actually, instead of me just pulling stuff out, I ask them, what do you wanna pull out? And oftentimes, they don't wanna pull anything out, and so they'll stay at the higher price. So you put the thinking work on them, and you put the onus on them to figure out, do they actually wanna get rid of stuff, or are they just asking for asking sake? Alright. So this last one is probably the funniest negotiation story I've seen one of my reps execute of all time. Yeah. So there was this one rep, really awesome rep, amazing seller, would run killer discovery calls. And at the end of every single call, like clockwork, he would discount his deals from 5 k to 4 k. Uh-huh. And it was like you're just shaving off, like, 20% for free. Mhmm. And the reason for that is that's how he knew his deals would close on time, is he would give him a thousand dollars, and then he'd say, like, you gotta close by the end of the month. Mhmm. And you have to do that sometimes, but there were a lot of deals where they had a compelling event, and we knew they had to close, and we knew we were the vendor of choice. And if he just let the deal go through that full list Mhmm. He would have gotten 5 k, and he would have had to close fewer deals. And so I set a rule for him. We were selling valuations at the time. And if someone had to do a valuation in the same month, like, you knew they had to close on time. Yeah. And I was like, if we're vendor of choice and they have evaluation this month, I forbid you from giving them a dollar. And he's like, I can't give them anything. I was like, you can't discount a dollar. Like, if it comes in $4.09 $9.09 Yeah. I'm sending it back, and you will send it back to the customer. I will not send it back. And so he gets on with this call. He quotes him 5 k. The valuation's in month, and the prospect goes, is there any movement on that? And I could tell he's never been in this situation before where he's actually willing to push back. He looks at the prospect, and he just goes, no. And the prospect just looks back at him. Send me the contract. And that was the moment that he broke his addiction to discounting. A lot of times the problem is when you give someone a discount, a prospect actually rewards you Yes. By moving their feet. A prospect rewards you by closing a deal. And so your mind creates this, like, screwed up feedback loop where if I give discount, my deal closes faster. And sometimes that is true. Yep. But if you do that on every single deal, it's the difference between having to close 40 deals and 50 deals. It's a lot easier to just keep what you had on every deal instead of going and forcing yourself to go and find another deal. The other dynamic at play there of how prospects reward you is, like, if you actually think about selling, so much of the sales cycle, like, you're trying to build this relationship with the buyer. You're trying to build a rapport. Like, you want them to like you to some degree. And a lot of what you're doing in deals are they're like, hey. Can we get a demo for our, you know, our managing partner? Or, hey. You know, I'm wondering if we can talk about what implementation looks like. And your job as a salesperson is to to to serve them in some way and be like, yeah. We can set up that demo. Yeah. No no problem. Let's talk about implementation. And then something switches the second you get to negotiation where you go from being the person who says, yes. We can help you to, no. I can't. And that feels very, very uncomfortable to have that flip. And buyers oftentimes are like, oh, but you were you were so helpful before. You can't help me there, which is why saying no in that scenario is very uncomfortable for new salespeople. But when you learn to do it and you see that you don't need to drop your pants to get the deal done, it's a really empowering feeling. In sales, there's something called a BATNA, which is your best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Mhmm. And that's usually how you can tell if I need to give a discount. Yeah. So for example, if I'm going and buying an Equinox membership, and next door, there's a premium gym that charges half the price, well, then my best alternative to a negotiated agreement with that Equinox is a pretty good deal. Yep. I can get a similar quality gym for half the price. Mhmm. But if Equinox is the only nice gym in the entire city and they have a monopoly on premium gyms, then my best alternative to a negotiated then my best alternative to a negotiated agreement is going to Planet Fitness where I'll pay $12 Mhmm. And the dumbbells don't go past 50 pounds, and I'm, like, turning off off the lung alarm and all that stuff. And, like, the Equinox rep knows if I like my premium gym based on the way they look at me, I like to go to the gym. Yep. They know I'm not gonna go to Planet Fitness, and they probably don't have to discount. So this last one for me totally blew my mind because I offered this customer a quarter million dollar discount to sign before the end of the quarter, and they almost missed that timeline because the person I told that discount to didn't tell the law firm's COO, and so he had no idea that they needed to move faster. So this was a deal in The Cayman Islands. It was really cool. I the Cayman Islands is part of my territory, and I did get to go on-site for, like, a multi day demo, which I had a very, very nice time there. But we do this demo. We were in a bake off against Thomson Reuters, who was, like, our biggest competitor, and it was, like, neck and neck. And I was talking with my boss, and she was like, look. I think we could get them to move if we discount our professional services cost. Like, we were priced at close to, like, a million dollars on, like, the migration, all the professional services stuff. Like, these were pretty big projects. And she's like, I think if we give them, like, a pretty meaty discount on that, we can get this thing to come in this quarter. And I'm like, alright. Like, I'm gonna give this a shot. And so there were a couple, like, key stakeholders in the deal. There's the partners. They had, like, a project manager. Like, this is a person pretty high in the firm who was, like, responsible for, like, big projects like this systems migration that we were gonna be doing. And then there was a COO of the law firm who was he was the ultimate decision maker. And so I get on the phone with the head of projects, and I'm like, hey, Miranda. I feel like we're really, really good fit for you all, and I feel like we validated that in the last couple demos that we had. And she was like, yep. I agree. We we really like you all. We probably need to do something on the pricing though to to, like, make this thing feasible for us. I'm like, well, I have good news for you. You know, we really wanna earn your business. And I had a long chat with the head of professional services at our company, and we're actually able to discount our professional services rate for you. And based on the number of hours that your project is gonna need, that's close to a quarter million dollar discount. Now there's one contingency, which in order for us to be able to give that to you, you would need to come aboard as a customer before the June, so before the end of the quarter. And this is, like, early May. And so that's a feasible timeline for us. And she's like, let me give that a little bit of thought, and I can get back to you. Great. Awesome. So I get off the phone with her. And a week goes by, two weeks go by, three weeks go by. And I ping her and she's, yeah, you know, no movement, no movement, no movement. And I'm like, what the hell is going on here? Like, this is a quarter million dollar discount. That's a lot of money. And finally, my boss is like, Nick, wait. What's going on? Like, we gave him a big discount. I'm like, she's not saying anything. And I'm she's like, call the COO. Call the COO? And she's like, yeah. Call the COO. So I pick up the phone. I call the COO, and I'm like, hey, Sven. I'm just just I'm calling to check-in, see how you're feeling about things. And he's like, oh, yeah. You know, I think I wanna see one more demo of your analytics module, but we're really liking what's going on here. And then I'm like, cool. You know, we had given you all a a discount to come aboard before the June. I know it's, like, early June now, and I I'm wondering is is that something you wanted to take advantage of? And he's like, the hell are you talking about? Like, the hell am I talking about? I'm like, yeah. You know, the the professional services. Like, we were able to reduce the rate if you come aboard. We really wanna earn your business. And he's like, this is the first I'm hearing of this, Nick. And I'm like, what? And what I realized in that moment was I had told one person at the law firm about this exploding discount. And you would think that she would have ran to the COO and been like, hey. This is a big cost savings for us, but she didn't. And oftentimes, the dynamics going on at our customers is, like, they don't share everything that's going on. They don't talk as frequently as we think. Like, this one deal, even though it was a huge piece of mental real estate for me, and I was thinking about it every single day for for hours. This was one thing on their plates, and it just didn't get socialized. And so I learned, oh, I gotta make sure that every person who's involved in this deal, if we put an exploding discount in front of them, exploding in the sense that it goes away, it explodes if they don't do it on our timeline, every single person needs to hear about it. And so it was good that I had called the COO to also socialize it, although a little bit later than I should have, because he was like, yeah. We need to move now. Forget about that demo. Let me start reviewing a contract. And so we got it in right before the June. But the lesson there is just because you put a fat discount in front of somebody does not mean the right people at the company know about it. You've gotta socialize this stuff in full. So, folks, if you like these, we've learned a lot of painful lessons in all of these negotiations. We broke down how to finish a negotiation in one cut in two parts. Funny enough. Part one is here. Part two is there. You can get both of those newsletters down the show notes. It's a step by step breakdown on how to finish your negotiations quickly without discounting too much, and we'll see you on the next one.
