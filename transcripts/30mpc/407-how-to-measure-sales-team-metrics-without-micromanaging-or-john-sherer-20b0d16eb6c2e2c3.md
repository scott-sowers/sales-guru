## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Mark Cosiglow. And we are back with the one and only John Scherer. If you missed last week's episode, John has led a whole ton of sales organizations, most notably led Lattice from 20 to a 120,000,000. He was there at HubSpot all the way through IPO, and he's done a million other things. He's a hall of fame 30 MPC leadership guest. In the last episode, we talked about all the different ways you can onboard your reps. And so this episode, once your reps are onboarded and you're running your sales organization, we're gonna talk about all the different metrics you should look at as a sales leader in a way that does not make you a dashboard manager, but you use the metrics to actually drive action. So, Mark, why should people listen? It's really simple. Metrics can be as harmful as they can be helpful. And I think John does a really great job of helping you understand great ways to make metrics helpful and avoid some of the stupid stuff that all three of us have dealt with in the past looking at metrics. And, folks, we are live in studio with John. And so if you wanna watch this one in Technicolor, you can go check it out on YouTube. But until then, three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, John. Welcome to your second round on the show. We start every show with your top three actual leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Number one, if you give a rep feedback and they do not apply it immediately on the next call, pull them aside, ask them why, and then ask them to apply the feedback immediately on the next call. Easy enough. What's number two? When you're looking at metrics, look for gaps between reps. This is where most of the learning is. So if one rep has a 42% close rate and one rep has a 35% close rate and maybe the the general population average is 35, look for that type of gap and then study what the rep who is the outlier is doing differently. It's where a lot of learnings are that you can pass down to the rest of the organization. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. You win the award for the cleanest, shortest takeaways. Tell me about it. For numbers. Without without having any fluff in them. It's perfect. What do you have for three? Look at your Looker dashboard every single day. You don't need to study it. You don't need to memorize it. But you wanna train your brain to start to see patterns really quickly. Your job is to find potholes. Your job is to understand what's breaking in the business. And the sooner you do that, the faster you can drive change. But if you're waiting every single month for your sales ops team to send you a deck on what happened last month, you're way too slow. Alright. So there's about 10,000,000,000 metrics that revenue leaders can look at us. Take us through you, like, your top five. What are the five ones that guide you every single day? Or maybe you have a different number. I don't know. But what guides you? I'm religious about sales velocity. How many ops are you creating? What's your average deal size? What's your close rate? And how long does it take you to close a deal? The collective of those things will teach you a ton. If you're a small startup and you're trying to go up market, yeah, your deal size is going to go up and your close rate is going to come down. But like, what does that mean? Is that good? Is that bad? There's a balance there. Sales velocity will teach you that. But really, I'm always looking at those four metrics. I'm looking at them on a rolling basis. I'm looking them at a cohorted basis. I'm looking at them quarterly. I'm looking at the monthly by rep, by segment. Those four things, honestly, like, it's what I need to do my job. Do you have a dashboard that shows all of them diced? Are you using filters to get down? Like, how are you managing that? Because, you know, by segment, by team, by product line, how are you managing all of those cuts? You know, I've always had a great data person who can help me get exactly what I want, make me the reports that I didn't really know I needed, but would teach me the situation. I had half a dozen dashboards that probably had 20 charts on them each. Now I have my go to dashboard with my core things. But as soon as I needed to go deeper, if I needed to get into headcount planning, if I need to get into, am I going to resegment the business, I need to go deeper. And so all of those metrics are available. But then I have like the core dash with the velocity metrics, how much pipelines created inbound versus outbound pipeline by rep, by segment, by manager, that type of thing. I have it all laid out in a Looker dashboard where I don't need to filter, where the dashboards are static, and I can look at them every single day. So let's start with this core dashboard. You have your four metrics, which is number of opportunities generated, opportunity size, close rate, time to close. But core dashboard that I'm looking at every single day, typically, in most of the businesses I've been a part of, the deal sizes per segment are very consistent. So I wanna see intro meetings completed. I wanna see it by rep. I wanna see it by segment. I wanna see deals that entered late stage. How many deals are actually becoming real? We have very nicely defined deal stages, so that is trustworthy information. That information is useless if you have not defined your deal stages. So those two things are super core to me, and then I wanna see win rates, inbound pipeline versus outbound pipeline, and then I wanna see outbound activity. You always want to look quarterly. But for me, I've spent a lot of my career with at least one SMB team SMB is a monthly business. Yep. It's a fully monthly business. Like, I think about SMB and enterprise like rugby in the NFL, they are different sports. SMB is its own thing. It is a velocity game. It is a momentum game. And a lot of times, you know, when you see low metrics and SMB early in a month, you can actually fix it that month. But you're you're working on a six to nine month time horizon, maybe an in quarter time horizon with enterprise. But SMB, you're in it every month. You know, every month, you can kinda rewrite your fate. You can chop the ball. You can you can let up, or you can really push people. And so those metrics are gonna guide what I'm gonna do in that Monday team meeting. If I feel like we're low on inbound leads and low on pipeline in general, like, yeah, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna talk about outbound the entire time. I'm gonna talk about your closed lost opportunities. Wanna talk about bringing your manager in on your demos. Let's try to improve the close rates on the deals we have left. And that ebb and flow, you're you're a driver. You're you're you're sometimes you're going faster. Sometimes you're switching gears, whatever it is, and the dashboard tells you what to do. Yeah. We always used to look at it as a current quarter, quarter plus one, quarter plus two, except for in our transactional business, which was current month, month plus one, month plus two. And your deal cycle determines the horizon. And then I think best practice is current plus one plus two that gives you that, like, forward looking, but not being so caught up in the now that you're, like, you're ignoring the future. Right? If I walk into the average sales leader, their eyes are glazed over, their doom scrolling through stupid dashboards. It's what 8AM, you walk in, boom, pop open Looker and, tell me how you process it. Like all the way from when you start, like is it a daily thing? Yeah. It's not even 8AM thing. It's like, you know, when you're sitting on the couch and you open up the Barstool app by accident, you're like, we need to look at this for now. That's what I would do with my dashboard. So I then bookmarked at the top. You have a meeting ends early, and I thoughtlessly click Looker. Yeah. And I thoughtlessly click a dashboard, and then I just just look at it and scroll. You know, it's, like, it's not high intention, but I am a quantitative person. And so, like, numbers algebra numbers click pretty quickly for me. I just do that all the time, but the patterns just come out. I was a sit down and prep for a meeting dashboard person. So, like, I fancy myself to be well, I know I'm a very operational sales leader. I'll I lean heavily in the process. Part of processes measurement. So I have to have set times where I sit down and look at dashboards for specific purposes. Like, scrolling through, kinda like you're doing, I would be a glaze over person. Like, I wouldn't find it if I just did that every day. So let's say that I wanted to zoom in on one of these metrics, whether I'm doing it passively or in one of these scheduled sessions. Let's talk about deals entering the late stages. What are you looking for? And then what are you doing based on what you see? I'm looking for gaps and numbers. Right? So if I see one rep who has 10 deals entering late stage when the average is six, you know, in one hand, you'd be like, sweet. Great news. Anthony, you're doing great. But my instinct is actually more like, okay. Something wrong here. You know, like, is he actually doing great? Or like, is he moving deals too early? Right? And so then I'm gonna I'm gonna ping the sales manager and I'm gonna say, Yo, like, what's up, Anthony's got a ton of deals late stage, and they should have the context to be like, yeah, like, he's got a hot pipeline or like, oh, that's weird. Let's look into it. And then I can say, you know, hey, so and so in sales ops, can you just like check out to see if Anthony's deals are mature? Like, if they're actually in the right stage. So that motion, I'm doing it all the time. And at the end of the day, like, it's quantitative, but it's driven by a qualitative understanding of the people and your managers and what's going on in the business. Because a lot of times, like, data is just there to answer questions for you, or it's there to prompt you with questions that you should ask people. And so you really need to be both like locked in on the data. But really with 40 dashboards to look at what you're hearing from your managers, what you're seeing in Slack, what you're seeing in in the rep conversations that you're having when you're doing skip levels, ultimately, will tell you what charts to look at. So there's a balance there. One of the things that you talked about was, alright, if I'm gonna look at this level of detail, like, every day, but if I have to do something strategic, I gotta go deeper. I gotta know more. Like, if I'm gonna strategic, I gotta go deeper. I gotta know more. Like, if I'm gonna resegment, you have to know more. Like, help me understand, like, how are you determining is this a tactical fix between a manager and a rep, or is this a strategic fix where I need to go deeper to figure out, like, do I need to resegment because I'm seeing stuff? Like, how do you make that determination as you're looking through all these numbers? I think it's I think at the end of the day, it's instinct. Right? Like, I can think about a time where we resegmented at Lattice, and one of the things that we were seeing was, like, we had a mid market segment. I forget the exact numbers, but call it 10 reps in it. And that segment closed deals from 30 k to 200 k. And what I saw is three of the reps had really high close rates on deals between a hundred and two hundred k, and everyone else had really low close rates on that deal. Certain reps are better at something than somebody else. Maybe that's because it's a different sales process there. Maybe there's a line that should be drawn at a 100 ks and there should be a mid market segment that's 30 to a 100 and a different segment that's a 100 to 200. Then we looked at enterprise who had two fifty plus and kind of looked at the same analysis and made up a rejiggering the teams. And so that's an example of, like, looking at close rates on certain ACVs that taught us there's actually a a different segment than we thought. We thought it was zero to a 100 employees. Actually, it was zero to two fifty. I remember a similar exercise at Outreach. What we did is we plotted deals in, like, small cohorts of deals, and we started to say, okay. Let's look at what happens as the deal size increases. And sure enough, like, when you look at that data, there's these step changes that happen. Like, oh my god. Between twenty five and thirty, something happens to our win rate. Something happens to our cycle time. And when you start to cut the data like that, the data tells you what to do. And if you see large discrepancies that are holistic across a group of people, that's a signal for strategic change. But if you have specific individuals that aren't meeting the rest of the group's priorities or maybe they're far exceeding them, then that's more tactical. Like, what are we doing here? Right? And that that's kind of how we did it. But those those four North Star metrics tell you almost everything. Everything else is kinda like a dig in on those four. If you get those four, you're saying that the sales velocity thing, we need to get that up the formula up on the show notes or something for people. Yeah. Because that that's a very nice, you know, glom together, you know, cumulative type of metric, but you do have to break it apart into its constituents to really understand what's happening if the metric is bad. It's a great metric to communicate to your board. Hey. Here's how we're looking at things. Here's what it means. Looking at it rolling in cohort, we're looking at it by segment. And I know that a lot of sales leaders, the first time they're kind of getting invited to the board level, that can be a stressful moment. I found that educating the board on sales velocity and saying, hey, we're gonna use this has been a really effective way to to build trust and then, like, stay locked in on one set of metrics versus, like, constantly pivoting quarter over quarter. So sales velocity is a metric that measures how quickly a sales team can generate revenue over a specific period of time. It's It's also known as deal velocity or pipeline velocity. Sales velocity is calculated using four metrics, number of opportunities, average deal value, win rate, and average length of sales cycle. The formula is sales velocity equals number of opportunities times the average deal size times the win rate percentage divided by your sales cycle length. Right? So you're basically taking how many opportunities do I have, multiply that by my average deal size, so number of opportunities, how big they are, that gets you, like, the total number. And then times your win rate percentages, which is, like, how many of those actually turn into revenue. And then you're taking that and you're dividing it by how long it actually takes you to close a deal. And I think that basically gets you it sounds like that gets you, like, a dollar per day Mhmm. Type of calculation. Is that what it's going for? Yep. 100%. How did you practically use this in in your daily conversations with reps? So I didn't really use velocity with reps. This is an upward management tool everywhere everywhere I've used it. Love it. You know, with reps, usually, I like to simplify math stuff as much as I can. And it's usually like, hey. We're we're gonna pick one metric at a time. Yeah. And we're gonna put this into your quarterly coaching plan. We're gonna try to move this metric. But velocity to me, a lot of times, it's it's an effective tool at communicating what's going on in sales to a non sales audience. If you have a product or marketing founder and you're trying to communicate to them what's going on, I think they see this equation. They're like, oh, yeah, it makes a ton of sense. And they can buy into that. And then you can, you know, sort of communicate, hey, like, sales velocity is going up this, like, the goal is always to, like, be growing sales velocity, typically, you know, if it's like, hey, sales velocity went down this month, they're like, oh, why? It's like, okay, well, let's look at the look at the inputs. Oh, look. Sales cycle length got really long in this period of time. Okay. Why is that? And deal size didn't go up, which is usually why you're willing to accept sales cycle length going up. Like, okay. Wow. We had these two deals that took a really long time to close. Is that something that could be a systematic issue that we wanna coach reps on, or is it an outlier? I remember about year two or year three at Outreach, I realized that I wasn't doing cohort analysis, and so all of my analysis was kinda junk. What is cohort analysis to you? Like, how do you think about, the word cohort? What does that mean? Say I wanted to look at my close rate in September. What I could do is I could see all the deals created in September, and I could see all the deals I closed in September. And that's gonna give me a reasonable win rate. Right? And I could show, like, hey, take a look. But what does that actually telling me? It's actually telling me nothing. Nothing. Right? This is where I got burned. Yeah. Because what what I care about is what is the close rate on the opportunities created in September. Mhmm. But guess what? They're not mature yet. So I'm stuck in this place when looking back a month where I'm like, how do I tell the story of last month? And so you actually need to then go a couple levels deeper and you need to understand, Hey, out of all of the opportunities created in September, how many should I expect to close? 50% of the deals we will ever close from a September lead will close in September. 25% of them will close in October. 15% of them will close in November. The rest sort of on a long tail. So I can now thirty days later, look back at September and begin to see, hey, am I pacing with this cohort of revenue effectively? This is super important, right? Because as your business starts to scale, what's going to happen is marketing is need is going to need to find new lead sources. You can't wait for full maturity on a batch of leads to see if they're a good fit. You can see it way sooner depending on your sales cycle length. Studying this early and often as your business changes is super important because you can catch like, oh, shit, like we didn't close any of those leads. Yeah. It's like, okay, well, let's stop generating those types of leads. Let's pivot. Let's do something different. And that comes from a cohorted analysis. So many early sales leaders I see don't know the distinction of there's a difference between, like, a close date and a start date. Do I wanna do a close date cohort where I'm looking at everybody that has the same close dates? Or do I wanna do a start date cohort where I'm looking everywhere that has the same creation date? So I wanna track everybody and all the deals that were created in May and what happened to them after May. Or I wanna take all the deals that closed in September, and I wanna back look at what happened to all those deals. Right? And Mhmm. That's the two lenses you have to look at with cohorts. Otherwise, you will create meaningless numbers. You'll go to your board and say, our win rate was 57% this month. We crushed it. The next month, it'll be 12%. And really neither number was accurate. So if someone asks you guys, what's your win rate? How do you answer that question? I'm going to give them, like, an averaged cohorted win rate. The first thing you gotta understand is your sales cycle, how long it takes for a cohort of leads to become mature. So say I have a ninety day sales cycle. Right? So that means we're in October, September, November. So basically, you're telling me the July deals I have are mature. So what I'm gonna go do is I'm gonna go look at my, like, q one, q two win rates. And that's actually gonna tell me a true cohorted close rate. Now, if you see a ton of movement in there, and you made significant change that can put you between a rock and a hard place where you're like, Yo, but I actually think we started crushing it in August, and the data is not mature yet. And that's where you can go and look at sort of like, okay, yeah, but August is 60% mature, how does a 60% mature August compared to other 60% mature periods to begin to show signal, That's not a close rate. That's a signal that close rate might be going up. So if it's q three today and you had a ninety day sales cycle, you can safely assume that you can look at q one. And, like, most of those deals should be, quote, unquote, seasoned or matured. And so for any deals that were created in q one, the the way you calculate win rates would be close one divided by close one plus close loss, or are you including all the deals that remain open? I include the things that would be considered still open Right. In that case. So it's close one divided by all opportunities generated in q one. Yeah. K. And and, normally, I think this is a place where there can be nuance, and it's important to define what is an opportunity. I would highly recommend all sales leaders to only include qualified opportunities in that win rate on the definition of a qualified opportunity. This can get you in trouble also. So for for us at Lattice, this basically was called stage two. An opportunity made it to stage two. We counted it as pipeline. Nothing before an opportunity was pipeline. And so, like, that definition needs to be super clear. Yep. I looked at qualified versus nonqualified win rates. So we created the opportunity at Outreach when the meeting was booked so that we could do some early funnel metrics, you know, and and analysis there. But it wasn't for us, and that was stage zero. Stage one for us was it was SOW as a sales accepted lead. It had gone through our five criteria. And, yes, now that's qualified pipeline that I can look at. So I always did a little differently. For me, I always looked at I reported, closed one over closed loss plus closed one, and then I had a secondary thing of remaining pipeline open. And and that would show me, like, alright. This is our win rate on what's closed. This is what is remaining open that we think we can get this kind of a close rate on. That was typically the way that I do it. But I think it's really important to have this idea of qualified versus nonqualified, and it has to be a religion inside your company. Nothing moves to stage one unless it's met the criteria. No laziness and nothing that's met the criteria stage in stage zero or an early stage, it must be moved over. And that that's a huge part of my weekly deal reviews is making sure that that is running well because, like you said, if somebody says what's your win rate And somebody that doesn't know sales, which just happens all the time, runs a quick Salesforce report and pops over and be like, oh, your win rate's 10%. And you're like, wait a second. You just took, like, every deal that's still open and took it over. You then you've screwed up the number. Right? And that's what people do a lot of times when they don't really understand the numbers. That's why it's so important to have an Anthony or a Brett on your team that understands and keep can keep you from these kind of pitfalls when you're looking at numbers. Mhmm. For both of you guys, it's critical that whether it's going into stage one or stage two, there's some cutoff point where you're like, this opportunity is qualified. It goes into win rate calculations, qualification calculations, and all that stuff. The most common way that this is enforced is through pipeline reviews. So managers are scrubbing pipeline, making sure that reps are coming in prepared with proper pipeline head hygiene and all that stuff. How much of this should be done through pipeline reviews versus done through Salesforce automations and validations? So for example, you can't move a deal from stage one to stage two unless you fill out these three fields on your opportunity. Who's the champion? Who's the problem? Stuff like that. My sales team right now doesn't fill out any fields in the CRM, not one. If you're an organization that's doing 30 to 40 new opportunities a month per rep, I think your strategy on what needs to be filled out here is pretty different because a manager is not scrubbing 30 to 40 apps. What's important to me is, like, I hold the rep accountable to their sales cycle or their their close rate. And so they're not gonna move shit to their actual pipeline if they think it's gonna make their close rate look bad. So I I usually end up with the reverse tension, which is like, like, now that wasn't that good of an opportunity. I'm like, like, you set up a second call. It's an opportunity. Right? So that was always the thing for me is, like, hold them accountable on close rate. Make close rate something that we talk about regularly. But if there's a second call, it's not. Yeah. I I have a general rule of thumb in my CRM. If we're not gonna report on it, then it shouldn't have a field. And, like, for example, we're gonna put MEDDPIC all in Salesforce, and the reps are gonna type it out MEDDPIC, and we're gonna create a validation rule that if they don't feel have these fields filled out, they can't move to stage two. If they can't be stage two, they can't create a flow. If you're not going to run a report to do analysis on a number, then why are you keeping the data? It doesn't make sense. All it does is create busy work for everybody. So you definitely should use validation rules as sparingly as possible, and you should definitely make sure that you limit the number of fields on the op on the account. Get it down to five fields. Like, the less fields, the better. I completely agree. There's one last objection that I struggled with related to this all the time, which is I know that this isn't helping me drive the sales process forward, but everyone else in the organization wants information around when we lose deals, why do we lose deals. And so I think every leader has been pressured to have crazy analysis on close loss, by stage, by product reason. Are we losing because of the economy? Are we losing because we don't have this feature? Are we losing because it was sunny outside versus rainy outside? And so when you get asked that type of question and you need to educate the world on when you're losing deals, John, why are you losing deals? How do you do it? You know what our number one, number one competitor at Lattice was according to Salesforce? Fifteen five. You know why? Because it's the top of the pick list. There's this tool called Gong. It records all the calls. All the information is in there. I don't know why you want a sales rep to tell you what happened on the call. It's recorded. They are literally trying to power through their day. They are not thoughtfully giving you data. Gong's there. Get everybody who wants information to see. I don't know how cool the AI stuff's gotten, but, like, you can always, like like, I've got somebody in The Philippines who helps me go through all the calls and pull out the things that the team needs to know. Plus, like, $7 an hour. Most closed lost reasons that when I go in and look at companies in their CRM, it's a single pick field. And a rep now has to make a judgment call. I know I lost it for these three reasons, but I can only pick one. Which one is the most influential? Which one, you know, which one is gonna matter and communicate about me and my skills the most versus I just moved it to a multi pick list field. And you can pick as many of the things are the reasons that you did it. You do that over a huge tranche of deals, and certain things bubble up to the top and certain things never get picked. But creating the closed loss reason as a multi pick list field is was like a game changer for me as far as loss analysis. Yeah. I love that. When someone asked me when we lose, where do you lose? I actually think about some of the metrics that you gave earlier. Revenue is going down or if our win rates are going down. Now I need to understand where in our stages are we losing deals. And maybe as we go from demo to multithreading stage, that's when we're losing deals. And what that means is certain reps are better at getting access to power versus others. But getting that stuff from, like, a pick list field, I found is just, like, super, super unavoidable. I think another good proxy for that is just if you have a sales roadmap with a stage based deal management and you have specific exit criteria and deals are falling out at certain stages, you know what the problem is is they're not able to understand how to achieve those exit criteria. And that's why you're losing deals. It's not because of competitors or prices, because reps don't know how, for example, to help somebody set an implementation date. The exit criteria to me is a a really strong way to to get real close lost stuff based on skill, not based on what the rep wants to tell you in a pick list field. So naturally, some of this stuff will happen with product leaders as well. And product leaders, they wanna know, okay. If we solve this problem, if we build this feature, like, this is going to impact the most amount of revenue, the most number of deals, and stuff like that. And so when you're trying to apply pressure on product to build the right types of things so that you can win more deals, how do you go about answering those types of questions? I tend to trust certain people in the organization. So I'm like, hey, Ross. Why are we losing deals? Like, I need you to think about it and get back to me and tell me why. And usually, Ross will come back with a thoughtful take and examples of where it happened. So more I'm more interested in specific examples than I am in data. For me, like, maybe it's because I learned better via stories, but, like, I actually think it's it's a better way to help people understand the nuances of what's going on versus, like, didn't have Salesforce integration. Right? It's like, k. Like, there's probably more to the story than didn't have Salesforce integration. And so I with those product meetings have typically brought in the reps or the managers per segment to have the experience and story to tell into the meeting with product and let them represent it. So that way product can ask questions and you have a person who actually was there who can answer those questions, or I don't feel like the data really helps them. If product is asking sales what is losing us deals, then they're not talking to the customers in CS about what is happening in churn because that's probably why you're losing deals. And so if product is looking for direction from sales on what to do to stop losing deals, typically, what you're gonna get is every rep's last thing that is the most important on the front of their mind. They're not gonna get a thoughtful answer versus if you just go to Gong or call recordings and listen to actual customer calls with your CS team, they'll tell you everything that you need to fix in your product. And this is what 90% of companies are completely oblivious to. They will do everything in their power to innovate, to get new sales, and won't do the most basic shit on the planet to keep a customer. Don't ask sales what to build next to win deals. Go ask CS what they need to do to keep deals. I guarantee you win more deals doing that. John, another amazing show. We have to move to the final question again. We talked about a lot of good habits. What is one bad habit that every sales leader should break so that all teams get a little bit better? If you have any inkling of a feeling that you should not hire somebody, do not hire them. Period. Even if you can justify it and do the mental gymnastics because you've got a hiring quota to hit and you don't wanna miss it because it's your quota, if you've got a feeling that says, just stop doing it. Yeah. It's never worked out for me ever. Soft yes is a hard no. Love that. That's right. John, amazing show. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Mark. It is time for a two by two recap from this part two episode with John Sharer. What do you have for your two? Two by two number one is I, at Outreach, was the number one user at Tableau, and I realized I made a huge mistake. Every dashboard had all these filters at the top, and I shoulda just done what John did and just forgot all the filters and just had every little report on the dashboard pre done. It would've saved me so much time. It would've been so much easier to see stuff. And then number two is the less fields in your CRM, the better. If you're not gonna report on them, if you're not gonna be using them, if reps are gonna fill them in with crap information, which is happening on 90% of the fields in your CRM right now, just get rid of them. They're not helping you in any way. They're holding you back. Let go. It's okay. Number three. When you're calculating win rates, you have to have some point of qualification for the opportunities, so maybe it's stage one or stage two. And then from there, you should not be looking at deals that were closed and lost within September. You need to go back and make sure that you're looking at matured pipeline. So, for example, if you want to know your win rates in q three, you might have to look at the deals that were created in q one so that they've had proper time to mature. And then lastly, number four, the four metrics in John's core dashboard were, number one, intro meetings. Number two, deals entering the late stages. Number three, win rates. And lastly, number four, inbound versus outbound pipeline generation. So, folks, in a couple weeks, Mark and I are doing a live session on his ultimate five stage sales process that he used at Outreach. He did not come up with that name. I came up with that name. And so, folks, if you want to put some of this reporting stuff in action, the key is to have a stage based sales process that you've enforced in your sales organization. Whether you want to sign up for that session live or watch it on demand depending on when you're listening to this, A link to that session will be in the show notes. And we'll also include links to every other episode that John has had on our show. I would really recommend listening to the first one ever. It is not only a really great episode, it is also pretty hilarious and fun. Alrighty, folks. Hang on, and we will see you for the intro.
