So there's three types of offers that you can leverage. First one is pitching the blind date. This is the easiest one. If I was gonna set up my friend, Armand, on a blind date, I would make sure to talk about how good looking he is and how charming he is and all of this other stuff. I'd really hype him up. Right? It's a great offer. Great offer. I thought we're not supposed to lie to our prospects. Yeah. But the thing in sales is, like, we just don't do this in sales. I worked with a client that sold an automated welding solution, and the SDRs would set up meetings for their AEs who had, like, over a decade of experience working with, like, VPs of manufacturing and these manufacturing plants. So, like, that's what we taught them to pitch, and literally, they would book, like, twice as many meetings by weaving that into the cold call pitch, and it sounded something like this. Nick, what I'd like to do is put you in touch with Armand. He's our account executive. He has ten years of experience working with VPs of operations exactly like you at companies like x, y, and z. You're gonna learn a lot about what's going on in the welding right now. So worst case scenario, pitch the blind date. If you're an SDR, pitch the AE. If you have SEs join that first call, pitch that person's expertise. Let them know who they're gonna be meeting with and how much of a resource they're gonna be. The the second type of offer is these one to many offers. A one to many offer is a really, really high quality resource. Think about the stuff that you get from 30 MPC, all of the guides on the website, stuff that's extremely tactical, but that could be repurposed across one to many. So an example of this, I had a client that sold to ecom businesses, and their marketing team put together, like, a state of ecom. Later, what they actually did that was pretty cool was they hired a third party to mystery shop all these businesses. So they knew, like, response time, hours of operation, channels they provided customer support. And that talk track sounded something like this. Hey, Armand. It's Jason with so and so company. I was giving you a call. I actually submitted a support request. And when I compared the response time to your competitors x, y, and z, it was about twice as long. You got a minute for me to share a little bit more why I decided to call you specifically. And, like, with that talk track, you're in the door every single time. Because their next question is usually, wait. Wait. What did you do? Oh, we actually mystery shopped you and x, y, and z competitors. Found some interesting things that I wanted to talk to you about. How are you guys thinking about response time and whether or not customers decide to to tab hop to some of your competitors? Just a super easy talk track. The last is really the holy grail for any enterprise rep, and that is a one to one offer. So these are custom tailored experiences or resources that you promise to create for the prospect or that you create in advance of reaching out to them. I'll give you several examples of this. A lot of our cybersecurity clients, they'll actually do, like, a free risk analysis, and they'll benchmark their cybersecurity and their their posture, how they handle things. They'll benchmark that against other competitors. So that's something that you can talk about. If you sell any solution that touches something that you can see, like a website, their social presence, whatever it might be, you can literally do a cart audit, their shopping experience. You can audit their website. If you sell something that helps with SEO, you can look at that stuff. I've have a client that has a podcast recording software. I mean, there's just so many things that you can do. So a personalized audit really helps. If you're selling to brands that sell b to c, you could experience the brand. So there's a rep at one of my clients that actually went into a Patagonia store. They did a quick analysis of the store experience. They took a selfie of themselves standing in front of the store, and that was dropped into the email. For some of the larger, more strategic reps, hosting workshops with their team and your internal experts, like, you're bringing stuff in. Like, the whole idea here is that if you're selling something really large, very high end, very enterprise or strategic, like, this is a great differentiator to get yourself in the door. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out.
