## Transcript

Good morning everybody and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to precedence club. My name is Arman Farouk and I'm here with my co host Nick Sigelski. And today, for round two, we've got the one and only, Florin Tautulia. He's a director of sales now over at Barley. Nick, why should people listen? It is getting increasingly more difficult to book outbound meetings. Luckily, Floren's still doing it, and he shared a lot of his best practices around contact strategy structure, messaging for above the line and below the line personas, and generally some good stuff in terms of how you can get some meetings. Above the line, three, two, one. Now we're below the line. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Florin. Welcome back to the show. You remember we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Yeah. I'm super excited to be here. Thanks for having me. So three actionable takeaways. Number one, you need to get your email deliverability in order, especially if you're a start up and don't have IT teams. One thing that I'm thinking about right now being at a start up is that email deliverability is a silent killer. If your open rates are less than 30%, it's likely has nothing to do with your actual subject line or the first sentence in that email. So before you even send anything, you don't want it to go into spam. So set up your DNS records. I know that's a technical term, and we can get into it if we want to. We're seeing an inbox warmer, which essentially tricks Gmail and Outlook into thinking that you're getting replies to your your inbox. And then some other tactical tips which are very quick that you can do. So setting up your profile picture on your Gmail or Outlook account, having no links in your first email, whether that's, like, a photo or a video link, which might be contrary to some popular belief. Having your address in your signature also helps quite a bit. And it's not like any one of these things is gonna put you on a blacklist, but it's almost this idea of death by a thousand paper cuts where it's, like, like, if you do a lot of these things right, the algorithm is looking for any possible sign that you might be a bot. So you're just helping yourself out here and giving yourself a shot to even get that great subject line, that great email in your prospects inbox. Beautiful. What's number two? So number two is, calling out direct reports of your prospects plus providing the cost of inaction in a subject line has gotten me to 80 or 90% open rates. So a lot of people tell you that subject lines need to be short and sweet. They need to sound internal framework I have before I come up with the subject line. So one is understanding, okay, who is my prospect by title? Two, who are the direct reports that will be impacted by your solution and call them out by first name? And then three, what is the actual cost of inaction solution? I'll give you a perfect example of this. When I was at a company called PLATO where we were selling a mentorship platform for engineering leaders, I was reaching out to VPs of engineering. Who are the direct reports that were impacted by the solution? It was, director and managers of engineering because they were the ones that were gonna receive mentorship from us. And then the other thing that we found in regards to cost of inaction when speaking with our customers was that if you didn't have mentorship, you're much more likely to leave the company, and therefore, that led to attention risk. So a perfect subject line that worked really well for us in that case was what happens if Arman and and Nick leave with the two names being the the direct managers or directors, and we would find that out on on LinkedIn with a little bit of research. Very nice. Round us out. What's number three? Number three is messaging and sequencing should be segmented for above and below the decision making line. And I think way too many salespeople and SDR teams specifically have the same messaging that's going out to both executives and also direct managers. And I think you have to realize that VPs and c level executives have very different priorities or or incentives than someone that's a direct manager or even a director depending on the size of the company. So I'll give you a perfect example of this when I was selling at Lupio in in the RFP space. If we were gonna go to a VP of sales and said that we can save, you know, you and your team time from copying, pasting, and making sure that your RFPs are nice and clean, I don't think that message would resonate especially in a a time like now where everything is being scrutinized so deeply. You have to go to the VP of sales with, like, a bottom line. Like, what is having an RFP response solution actually doing for you? So researching, for example, hey. I noticed you're going into enterprise space. Have you thought about how you're gonna win RFPs in the enterprise space where they're much more prevalent compared to a company or one of your competitors that's been in the enterprise space for ten years? And that's a problem that a VP of sales is actually now gonna listen to. Right? As opposed to if I'm selling to a proposal manager, they care about their day to day. They want high quality work. They don't wanna copy and paste. They wanna, you know, log off and and go and actually enjoy their their weekends. They might not even necessarily care at an enterprise company or know what the bottom line or the three main priorities of the executive team even are. So those messages need to be very different. So, Florin, one of the things that I struggled with back in the day when I was prospecting is I would have so many different cuts and segments of sequences. And so, for example, I would have above and below the line like you discussed, but I would have it by persona. I might have it by product. I might have it by trigger. I might have it by, they raised around or they had a batch new hires. And when I wanted to add one thing to my messaging, I would end up having to add it to, like, 20 different sequences. And so do you have a recommended either number or way that you would typically segment your sequences? Yeah. Yeah. It's a very common problem, and I do a lot of of sequencing consulting too. And what you tend to find over time as companies grow, like, you'll end up with hundreds of sequences and no one even knows what's working anymore, and it's that exact problem. Like, you have to change so many different things. I'm a very big believer in keeping it as simple as possible. So I can't give you an exact number of what the best number of sequences is because it depends on how many use cases you have, how many different personas you have, how many industries you're selling into. But I like to make my sequences persona based. So if I'm selling, let's say I'll give you an example. Our RFP software, we're selling into sales teams and also infosec teams. So I'd have, above and below the line sequence for VPs of sales for CSOs, then also for below the line for the same type of persona. And, that's pretty much that's pretty much it. And then the use cases, I'd have three use cases within each sequence so that if a specific use case didn't resonate with that persona, maybe the second one did. If not, then third. How would you decide how you would allocate your time prospecting across those four different sequences? Because one area that I think I've struggled with in the past is I would say, alright. Like, I should be going above the line, and I would spend all of my time on, like, the above the line sequences. Or I would spend all of my time on the infosec persona, and I would I would, like, exhaust my territory there, and then I would go after the VPs of sales. Like, what's your approach to the division of your focus? I think it's very important that you focus on both almost equally. I think what's really valuable about the below the line sequences is you can get a lot of good information from them without necessarily trying to book a meeting and being more educational, where you can take that information and then go to above the line personas and come with an educated email that actually is relevant to them. For example, it's way easier to cut through the noise and for us to get through to a proposal manager than it would be through a VP of sales. So having a conversation with the proposal manager, I'm not trying to sell you on the platform. I'm trying to understand how your process is running, what your win rates are, how long it's taking you to onto an RFP. Then I'm gonna go to the VP of sales in the above the line sequence and be like, hey. Talk with a few members of your team. It sounds like your win rates or RFPs are 10%. That's generally lower than what we're seeing, and then try to explain to them why our solution would help with that. So I don't think you should neglect any one of those personas. I think they're both equally as important. I I wanna ask about sort of the the backdrop or context for that conversation with the proposal manager because my entire career, any prospecting outreach that I'm doing is with the intent of I want to have a sales meeting, a sales interaction And you're not doing that, it sounds like. You're setting up a conversation. I don't know. Is it over email? Are you getting on a Zoom call? Like, how are you incentivizing this person to just share a bunch of information with you when you're you're not even gonna try to sell them the thing? You're gonna go to the VP of sales next. What's the context you give them? Yeah. Well, I I still think you need to highlight what the future state is gonna look like for them. Ultimately, we're trying to make your your life better. I generally know what kind of problems you're facing as a proposal manager, so I'm stating that in an email, and I'm highlighting with the future state what your future could look like. So imagine instead of having to write, like, a a 10 page document, we can automatically, with a click of a button, answer all these questions for you, and now you can actually focus on quality, improving your win rates, and just giving you back more time. One of the main things that we were hearing were, like, people were working into weekends, evenings, not spending time with their family because it took so long to craft these documents. So just like going to them and painting the picture of, hey. We can help you. I know you're not a decision maker. I just wanna understand how you're doing things so that we can build a case to go to your leader and and ultimately help you out. So there still has to be something in it for them. We're not, like, not selling them, but letting them know that, hey. I'm not here for you to have a formal evaluation. It's totally okay. I just wanna learn how you're doing things. In our prep, Lauren, one of the things that you talk about is the new low friction CTA is actually not having a hard ask for a meeting or for something, but rather focusing on educating your prospect without an ask upfront. Can you talk about that process a little bit more? Yeah. So there's a guy called Harry Sims. I keep calling him out when I talk about permission slapping because he's the one that came up with it, and I've been using it, and I I love it. The whole idea is that I'm not even asking for interest anymore, especially below the line. I'm essentially just asking you for permission to give you some kind of valuable information. So that'll come in the form of, here's an observation that I have about your business. For example, like, I noticed that you're going into enterprise. Do you mind if I send you a quick ninety second videos to show you how we can help you respond to RFPs? And it's a painless ninety second video. Or here's a a benchmark report that we built out just so that you can get an understanding of what win rates in the RFP space actually look like. And that tends to facilitate a conversation, which then leads to a sale later on. But, again, this is long term thinking, not short term thinking, and this can be a whole separate conversation around incentivization for people like SDRs that are prospecting. But I think, especially in this environment, we need to start thinking more about educating, in some sense, becoming an inbound engine even though we're outbound. So what you're doing is you're essentially creating your own inbound in this case. Instead of saying, can I get a meeting with you? You're trying to warm up that interest by giving them something first. When you compare your replies on an educational give versus a meeting ask, how meaningful of a lift do you see on the reply rate if this is done correctly? Yeah. Like, 30 to 40% is is what I've seen in terms of reply rates. Now that doesn't mean that's outbound accepted opportunities, and there could be some issue there around, like, attribution. Because what ended up happening to us a lot, a lot of people would come inbound from the same accounts that we outbounded two or three months ago. So that indicated to me that it was ultimately working, but it's not very easy to track. So I tried this strategy once when I was selling to law firms, and I remember once just getting a response, y e s, all lowercase letters from, like, this managing partner of the law firm. And I was like, oh, okay. I guess I can send this person more. But is your approach when somebody all they give you is a thumbs up? What happens next? Yeah. I think the most important thing is make sure you don't go into selling mode there right away. I think a lot of people will be like, okay. Here's the piece of content, and now do you want to have the meeting? I think you should do the exact opposite and have patience. I like to personally send videos. I send, like, a the sixty or ninety second loom, which is what I promised them in the first place when I was permission slapping or asking for permission to send. Then I wait a couple of days, and then the next thing is just asking what, like, in some form, what they thought of that piece of content or that video or maybe highlighting one specific thing. It's like, hey. In that video, I actually talked about this one thing. What are your thoughts on that? Do you think that could help? And then if they don't respond, waiting another few days and then sending them another piece of content. So I I don't even think you should try to push for that meeting until at least, like, the second week is what I've been doing. But right now, yes, I 100% recommend you put them into another sequence. That's essentially like a a short term nurture sequence. One thing that this reminds me of is a couple weeks back, we had Charlotte Johnson on the podcast, and she very much differentiates her outbound sequences where she's explicitly trying to get a meeting versus her deposit sequences. And so once you've worn out a prospect and you've asked them for meetings a bunch of times, this can be one way that you can warm prospects back up because what a lot of reps will do is they'll just sequence someone for thirty days. They'll wait thirty days, and then they'll do the exact same thing, and they'll hope that something changed. But the reality is usually something has not changed, and you're just begging for someone to be in the right place and time at that point. Florent, can you you've mentioned the concept a couple times of above versus below the line prospecting. And we've talked about how you should segment your messaging, how you're often And we've talked about how you should segment your messaging, how you're oftentimes using the information you get below the line, above the line. But can you talk about just, like, key principles or things to or to not do when prospecting above versus below the line? One, you always need to do your research above the line. The very generic emails are never gonna get across to those types of people. If you think about how much noise they have, and, Arman, I'm sure, like, you can relate to this too as a VP of sales. Like, you probably get a ton of of messages. So something that's generic is just not gonna work. You have to spend more time doing it. If you're working with public companies, I think it's a 100% necessity that you're going into the 10 k reports, you're going to the call transcripts, or you're doing some kind of Google search on the company to try to understand what is their strategy for the next year. And the I haven't come across a case yet in our account where you can come up with some personalized information that somehow ties the bottom line to to your solution. And if you can't do that, maybe that means that account is actually not a good fit for you. And that's telling in itself, and it's probably gonna save you a lot of time anyways. So I think I think that's the main thing. I think you can do a bit more of an automated type of sequence below the line, but never for above the line. What's the depth of personalization that you're doing for these above the line folks? Maybe at a public company, that's a really great target for you. The standard that I've seen is that most people will personalize the first email that they sent. And then from there on out, it's bumps and then generic follow ups. But you're doing a lot of work reading 10 k's, like, learning about their strategy. Are you incorporating deeper personalization into multiple steps? What's that look like? So most of the sequences that I have are mostly automated for above and below the line, but the difference is that above the line, there's two to three emails that are, let's call it personalized or relevant based off of research. Yeah. So if I'm working in account, going into that call transcript quickly, going on their website, going to the investor tab, doing control f in the transcripts to look for certain keywords that you can identify that usually signal that they're a good fit and something that you can use. And then two to three emails. So remember I said there's three use cases per sequence? So that first email for each use case is personalized above the line. Can you talk about if I'm an SDR or an AE and I'm trying to prospect and I don't wanna read a 10 k or an investor or the investor day transcript line by line, what are the types of keywords I might use that would illuminate a problem that a customer could have? Yeah. Very specific to what you're trying to solve for. Because, for example, when we were dealing with, Plato engineering teams, we were looking into, like, r and d investment in the risk section around, like, hiring issues, retention. When you're focusing on sales teams, you probably wanna focus more on, like, top line growth expansion into new territories, twenty twenty three plans. If you're a cybersecurity company, you probably wanna stay more in the risks and, like, are there issues around security breaches? So the it really depends on on what who you're selling to or what division of the company. It's definitely a bit of an art. Like, at this point, for example, I can go look into a transcript. You do a control f, and you you look for your 10 keywords, and then you can formulate some form of an email within, like, ten, fifteen minutes when you get good at it. This is not something that's meant to take you an hour of time, and it might in the very beginning, but I also think it's up to the managers and the sales enablement team to teach you or have some kind of a session on how do you read these things, what are the keywords that you need to search for. Lauren, I wanna ask you about your general sequence structure. So let's say I'm prospecting into a VP of sales. Can you give me a sense of the touches that you're making, the frequency of those touches, like, the density of the touches? What's a general sequence look like for you when you're going after a VP of sales? Yeah. I'm not gonna say anything revolutionary here. I think, my frameworks are somewhat based off of the famous Goji sequence. I I'm very much a believer in don't fix what's not token. And I've tried a ton of different sequences over the last eight years, and that one still tends to work really well. So just to summarize probably what other people have said as well, 12 to 15 steps at least must be over twenty business days, twenty to twenty five business days, and it must be, like, a omnichannel approach, Emails, phone calls, and, LinkedIn. I think that the only thing I'm gonna say that's different here is a lot of people feel like, oh, all of my meetings are happening over email and, like, calls don't work. What you need to start thinking about is how a sequence is very much like a demand gen engine and like a retargeted ad. Just because people are not picking up their phone, if that truly is their phone number and they can see that call from you and then you send them an email and then they see, like, that phone number in the subject line and then they see your face on LinkedIn, that that means it's it's working. If you're getting a reply anywhere in your sequence, it means that all of the channels are, like, working together in unison somehow. So don't discount one channel because the other one because that one is not working. I also have some data on this. I actually did an experiment where I ran the exact same sequence, with just LinkedIn and email and then added calls to it. And it was a I think it was close to a 40% increase in replies just because the third step was added. Wow. It's, similarly, I ran a an experiment when I was running the SDR team back at Carta where we were running two sequences that were exactly the same, and the only difference was we added two calls to one versus the other. And even where people weren't picking up the phone, it was because we were leaving voice mails. It was because they were seeing the phone number pop up. It powered the replies of the other emails. And I think there's a similar concept around LinkedIn messaging too where I I from personal experience, I don't book a ton of meetings on LinkedIn. I get a lot of people who will reply to my email because I reached out to them or nudge them on LinkedIn or I connected with them. And so on the note of sequence structure, Florin, can you give me a sense of when and how are you weaving in social touches into your sequences? And then second piece of this would be, are you doing this for all of your prospects, or are you really only reserving this for your key prospect? Yeah. So I'm a big believer in bursts. And the reason I say that is because I I actually let SDRs I don't even reply to SDRs right away because I wanna see their sequences. I don't know if that's, like, bad to admit. But, one thing I noticed that works on me is bursts. So what that means is that on day one, for example, if I'm sending an email, I'm gonna make a call right after, and then I'm gonna either connect with them or at least have my profile views on so that they get that notification. What I realized is even if I'm not picking up the phone, I'm in a meeting. But if you send me an email, I see that you connect with me on LinkedIn and you called me within an hour, I now know you're there. And that that is from personal experience. So it can't just be me that's that's going through this. So that's why I think bursts work because they're you're kinda getting surrounded across multiple channels. And you're also letting people respond to you how on their preferred platform of communication. Right? I think that's the other most important thing. I'm a believer that everyone needs to get at least some. And remember, a touch can be as simple as a profile view. If you're already on sales navigator and you're prospecting, like, let's say, maybe it's not a priority account, you're already providing some kind of a touch point there. It doesn't take much to add a connection request in and then send one email message at some point as well. So I think you should do it for everyone. When you're doing that social prospecting, are you sending a connect request with a note? Are you commenting on their stuff? Are you sending them an InMail? What's sort of your preferred use of of LinkedIn? Yeah. I actually don't love InMails too much. Again, it depends very much on your persona. I just found that it didn't work for who we've been reaching out to. So two options. One, it's either a blank connection request that usually has about a 70% connection rate, like, over time from what I've seen, or it's almost similar to voice mail. It's like you're guiding the person through your email. You're never pitching. It's very short. Be like, hey. Sent you an email regarding mentorship. Wanted to put a face to the name. Florin, this has been a phenomenal episode. I love getting to dig into the specifics around your contact strategy, and I felt like you gave so much more detail than we've gotten in our past couple episodes. So thank you. We're running out of time. We gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really good things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think that they need to break because it hurts them more than it helped? Yeah. And this might not be a very tactical sales one specific. It's more general advice to salespeople. I think too many salespeople go to to podcast, go on LinkedIn, and follow, like, content creators and then take these tactics and apply it to their own company. What you have to realize is that context is very important. You have your own personas that you reach out to, your own industry, your own product market fit. Just because a tactic works for one specific person doesn't mean that it's gonna work for everybody else. So take advice with a grain of salt, but the biggest message I have is use the data that you have because you're in a unique situation. And if you understand the fundamentals and this is why it's so important to understand the fundamentals and not just, like, take tactics because tactics change, but fundamentals never do. And if you understand the fundamentals, you can be the one that's creating the tactics as time goes by. Boom. Florin, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Florin Tetullia include, number one, segment your sequences between above and below the line decision makers. Number two, permission slap. Ask for permission to give valuable information. In other words, you can ask someone if you can send them a ninety second video to show you how you might get a sense of what win rates would look like in an RFP. Number three, look for keywords in the investor day transcript or in the 10 k, then attach those to the messaging that you use above the line. And then lastly, number four, prospect in bursts. And that doesn't mean bursts of sending 50 emails. That means bursts of voice mails, social touches, and emails because all of those things work in the totality of the touches to drive more replies. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So Florin talked about his sequence structure in this episode. And if you were the type of person who, like, whipped out a pen and paper and was scrambling to write everything down, well, you didn't have to do that. Believe it or not, we document best practices for sequence structure or cold call scripts on the 30 to presidents club website. So if you go to 30mpc.com, you can actually steal some sequence structures that we put together for you. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes to presidents club.
