## Transcript

Sales managers, no one ever teaches you how to do your job. If you've ever wondered, why are my pipeline reviews useless? Should I actually hire this person or am I gonna have to fire them in three months? Or maybe my forecast is like a finger in the air exercise where I'm totally guessing. Guess what? You're probably a little bit like me and you had to figure out this stuff from scratch. Fortunately, I partnered up with the best sales leader in the game today. His name is Mark Casaglow. He led outreach from zero to 250,000,000 plus in ARR, and he has graduated eight sales managers who just became VPs. And that is through his three step sales management operating system. There's a special discount code in the comments. I guarantee it will be the best sales management resource you've ever used in your life. You're hiring wrong, and I know why. Actually, I do know why. The reason is very simple. There's something called the halo effect. And what the halo effect does is your first impression around somebody dramatically impacts how you think about them for the rest of the time you talk to them in an interview. Because you haven't sat down and thought out exactly what do I need to figure out about this person and how do I do that, You will always hire wrong. So today, we're gonna get into three things. What are our hiring principles? How do we build the ideal rep profile so we can go grab those all stars? And last, what is the four step interview process that'll make sure that you're hiring winners? And little hint here folks, most of what we are going to be looking for is stuff that actually cannot be found on someone's resume. So if you think most of what you need to hire for is based on experience, that is about to be flipped on its head. So Mark, let's talk about your upfront hiring principles. What are the three things that you can hire for? My three principles of hiring are traits, skills, and experience. Traits are who you are. For example, are you a hard worker? Do you have IQ? Are you curious? Do you have grit? Skills are what they can do. Can they just do discovery? Are they good at negotiations? Are they good at prospecting? Experience is what they've done. In other words, the context in which they've used those skills and demonstrated those traits. For example, I've been an SMB rep at a transactional company that does $5,000 deals every thirty days. So how should I think about prioritizing traits versus skills versus experience? This is where most people get it wrong. Most people look at experience and that is the number one thing because they feel safe. This person has done this job before. If you hear that and you're hiring, oh, guess what? This person's done this job before. That's usually like a yellow flag for me. Something that makes me concerned because that means we're over indexing on experience. So experience is the easiest thing to get someone, especially today when you can look at Gong calls, when people can sit with a mentor. It's very simple to help get somebody up to speed on industry knowledge or segment knowledge or specific product knowledge or something like that. Sales skills are teachable. We've talked a lot in our other modules about having these containers for enablement where we work on the skills of the rep, where we increase their ability to do certain certain things that are required for the job. Right? But we don't want to over index on skills in hiring because they're teachable. Also, people that have skills usually have baggage. There's things that we have to untrain them in order to do it the way that we want to do it, the way that works best at our company. The last is traits. Traits are innate. You can't teach them. They're very, very hard to develop. If you have to change someone into a hard worker or a curious person or someone that has EQ, think about the amount of effort that you have to do there. These are also the foundations or the platforms on which everything else is built on. So make sure that you hire for traits first, then you look for skills, and then you look at experience in order to find those right candidates. We just hired one of our first SMB sales reps. Her name is McKenna. And I promise you, I would have rather hired McKenna, who has two months of closing experience, over most mid market AEs that I see in the market today. And the reason for that is she has extreme curiosity and coachability. And anytime I teach her something, she soaks it up and figures it out the next week. I can teach her our discovery playbooks extremely quickly. I can teach her how to story tell in a way that exudes the enthusiasm of 30 MPC extremely quickly. I can't do that with a lot of mid market and enterprise reps who are ingrained in their bad habits and are not curious and are not coachable. That said, there's probably a point where this gets taken to an extreme. Mark, my guess is you're not hiring someone with zero closing experience whatsoever into an enterprise AE role. Right? That's exactly right. You want to hire on traits, but you want to screen for experience. That gets your playing field down to the people that have the ability to do the traits in the right way. You don't wanna, for example, hire an SDR into an enterprise sales role even though they may have all the traits that you want. There needs to be some context, but we do not hire based on experience and skills. We screen on it. Exactly. So if you're opening a mid market AE role, you might say that three years of closing experience gets you in the door. But then once all of your candidates are in the door, you make your decision based on traits and maybe a little bit on skills, but mostly on traits, not on experience anymore. The way I look at it is the cake is traits. The icing is skills. Experience is the sprinkles. Right? So we wanna make sure that we hire based on the cake, not on the icing. So let's talk about your ideal sales traits because your interview process is built around testing for traits, not testing for experience or even skills. So what are the most common traits that I can look for in a sales rep? Now we're gonna give you my traits, and these are traits that are generally applicable. It is vitally important that you decide on your traits in a story to give you an example of how this went wrong. At Outreach, when we had just gone to about $10,000,000, we were ready to go to 25,000,000. We had to hire some reps. We hired a bunch of number one reps at other SaaS companies. We were just attracting amazing talent. Almost all of those people failed. The reason they failed is most of them had a big brand that was somewhat established behind them, and they were used to selling into that type of a market. The trait that we needed was we needed this evangelical passionate person that could go out and evangelize and proselytize and get people to come over to our side of thinking at Outreach. And these people, while they were great sellers, didn't have that trait. So So it's a perfect example of why you need to make sure that traits are what you hire on even though all those people made it through the the screen. Another example I'll give you is when I was selling compensation software at Pave, I joined that company at about a 100 k of ARR. And early on, the most important thing that you need is number one, you need someone who's really curious about problems because oftentimes, you don't even have the right product yet. So you need your salespeople to be so good at finding problems that they can work with the product team to pull your business into product market fit. And then number two, I was looking for someone who is like a really, really, really good storyteller. And that was just something where I needed to feel that person's enthusiasm through the phone because we weren't gonna win on product. We needed to win on the transfer of vision to another prospect. And that is something that you can't teach someone enthusiasm. That is something that is innately going to come through as a trait in that human being. So, Mark, you have nine traits that you test for. Let's walk through your nine traits. Alright. The nine traits are coachability. Can someone listen to what I tell them to do and then go do it? It's not just hearing it, it's actually putting it to action. Two, passion. Can they transfer enthusiasm or not? Three, curiosity. Do that natural inclination to ask questions and to really poke to find answers. Four is grit. Can they push through tough situations? EQ is next. Do they have the ability to read the room and adjust the energy based on what's happening? Dot connecting. Can they take their internal curiosity of what they know about their product and their company and the external curiosity they have about the customer or the buyer and connect those dots so that things make sense. The next one is can they teach? Can they take complex concepts and break them down very simply for people to understand? Comfort and ambiguity is the next to last one. That is in a world where things aren't certain, where I don't quite know what to do, do I have ability to make sense of something, pick a path, and move forward? And the last one, really important to me, hard work. Can they push through? If they have 99 dials and it's 5PM, do they stay an extra five minute to make the hundredth one because they just can't help themselves? That's what I'm looking for in a rep is those nine traits. So let's start with coachability. How do I test for coachability? Alright. Coachability is the funnest test I think that there is. And what we're gonna use is this is a secret, and I hope you'll see this. We're gonna use skills to test for traits. So what I'm gonna do is for coachability, I'm gonna use objection handling skill, which is teachable, to see if they have the hard to teach trait of coachability. So, Arman, let's role play this out real quick. Arman, what is your biggest objection you get as an AE at Pave? It's usually that the timing is off because our merit cycle isn't for another six months. Great. So timing. Would you mind real quick if we did a role play where you did an objection handling for a timing objection for me? Right now. Alright. Pause. See? We just saw the nonverbal cue of a reluctance to walk into a role play, which says to me they might not want to be very coachable. Right? So I've not picked up on the first queue, so we're gonna enter back in. Yeah. Right now, do you mind if we just jump in? I sure. I wasn't ready for it, but I I can give it a shot. Alright. Great. Now what I would do now is I would say something like this. Armand, you know what? You've been great. Your pricing is pretty good. We think Pave is act actually pretty awesome. But for some reason, the timing just isn't right for us right now, man. Why don't you call us back in six months? Now Armand is gonna answer however Armand answers. Right? And I actually don't really care that much about how he answers. What I wanna do is see what he does with my response to the answer. So let's say that Armand finishes his answer. This is what I would say. Armand, great job. I see that you do get that a lot. That sucks. We need to get you over at a company like ours where we don't have that objection that much. But anyway, let me ask you this. Do you really think that the objection was timing? No. I feel like the objection was actually that it's not valuable enough, so it's the easiest thing for them to just, like, kick down the road. Right. So now what I'm gonna start to do is I'm gonna give coaching. I'm gonna watch what happens when you do coaching. So I just ask an open ended question. I'm seeing him oh, he's actually starting to think through this. And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give some advice. I'm gonna eventually say something like, I know what, those are interesting thoughts, Armand. What would you think about this? Is, most people when they give their first objection, it's like a knee jerk trained response that isn't really real. So what I'd like to do is can we redo the role play? And this time when I give you the objection, can you ask me a clarifying question back? And then let's run the role play like that this time. Sure. Alright. I can give it a shot. So pause again. We've already seen there's a difference now. See, sure. Yeah. He's now showing me that he maybe wants to learn. Maybe he's hesitant on role plays, but I'm getting a little bit deeper into him now. So I would say, alright. You know, hey, Arman. We love Pave. We love you. You're awesome. Price is great. Timing is wrong. Got it. Hey. Completely understand. Honestly, a lot of times, it's not always the perfect time to invest in comp software when you got other things going on. Could I get a sense of, like, is it that it's just because your merit cycle isn't for another six months? Or is it that right now, like, compensation just, like, isn't the biggest problem for you guys to solve given all of the other things you're doing around, like, performance reviews right now? So So we're gonna pause the role play. What I'm looking for right now in this time where we're redoing the role play is one of three things. One, does Arman just get it? Obviously, Arman's a pro. He just got it. Knew where we were going. Cheat code. But Arman, first of all, got it right. I actually don't care about that one that much. The second thing that happens is Arman completely ignores the coaching. That's where I'm like, this probably isn't a coachable person. Right? He just cannot get his brain to behave differently based on the information that we've given him. The third thing that happens is Arman tries it, and I can feel the gears turning in his brain. I can feel him working on it. That's my favorite. That says to me somebody is willing to embrace that ambiguity of the situation, the complexity, the uncomfortableness of it. And now I know if this person is a good coachable candidate or not. Alright. Let's look at another one, passion. Passion is your ability to transfer enthusiasm. So I'll tell you a story about this. And the way that I do this is I say, hey, Armand. What's something that excites you that most people may not be excited about? I I've really been enjoying musical improv recently. Musical improv. Okay. That sounds, a little anxiety inducing to me. Make me excited about musical improv. Hey. Have you ever watched the show Whose Line is it Anyway? Alright. So this is what would happen. Right? So you can already see there was an immediate lighting up. There was something there was a transfer of energy right there, and I'm gonna listen to him. And my story of this example is one time I asked somebody this question, and they said, I love interpretive dance. Now listen, I'm not really a dancer. I was very lucky. I have two daughters that weren't into dance, so I didn't have to do the whole dance dad thing. But here's what happened is that guy took me through. He's like, Mark, imagine that you're on a stage. And the man, I could feel the energy. I guess, actually, feel it right now. He was like, imagine you're on a stage with 30 other people. Everybody's arms are the exact same angle. Everybody's feet are the exact same width apart. All of a sudden, the music hits, and everybody in the crowd's going wild, and you're just you don't even think it. It's just a reaction, and everybody's like a robot all working on this. I was like, damn. Sign me up for interpretive dance. Let's go. Right? I knew that that guy had the ability to transfer enthusiasm or not. And, like, all it takes in this stuff y'all is one little trick. Think for a second in a thirty minute conversation, how can I get this person to go into the state of the trait I want to assess? I'm gonna put them into the state of coachability to see if they're coachable. I'm gonna put them into the state of passion to see if they're passionate. You ready to do another one? Let's do it. Let's put you into the state of grit. So this was one of my favorite ones. My buddy, Alex Kramer, who we've mentioned before, helped me come up with this one. So let's say that I wanna measure grit, and this is what I would do. I'd be like, Arman, tell me a story about you that really really, like, resonates with me with grit. Like, tell me why you have grit. Right? No matter what Arman says, I don't care. This is my reaction. I'm not really feeling it, Armond. Alright? And this is what does, because I've now put him into a state of grit. Someone that has grit, you know what happens? They get pissed. They they actually show their grit. They go, like, what do you mean? People with grit will fight back. People that don't have grit will say things like, well, maybe let me re explain it. Oh, I'm sorry that didn't land. You know, and they just really regress backwards away from grit. So that's the third example of a way to make sure that you're testing for something that most people say in their values that they want, but they have no idea of how to make sure that they assess if somebody actually has that value or not. Alright. So what's the last test for hard work? The last example we'll do is around hard work. Alright? Hard work is very difficult to assess, but what I do to do that is I put them again in a state where they have to show me hard work. What I do is I say very simply, let's say that I'm at Thanksgiving dinner with your family, Armand, and we're sitting around and everybody's making fun of everybody and it's super fun, and I ask a question. I'm like, hey, I think all Armand is like a workaholic. Like, what where did that get started at? What would be the story that your entire family would rush to that would tell me that you were a hard worker? Right? Now that seems like a weird question, but let me give you an example of an answer that I got one time. This is why I so believe that this is a great way to assess hard work because hard work is a choice you make every single day. Right? It's a trait. It's inside of you. You should have a story of when you decided that you wanted to work hard. Right? So I had this young man. I was interviewing him, and he goes, you know what? My dad grew up in Eastern Europe, and he moved to Chicago as an immigrant, and he worked his ass off to buy our house and the two lots next to us. And he tore down those houses, and he built a small farm that looked like his farm when he was growing up as a kid. And every morning, he would make me wake up at 4AM to tend the farm on a city block in Chicago. This is, like, insane. Right? And he's, like, he would pay me to help him, but I hated it. So when I got like 16 or 17, what I ended up doing is, I was like, you know, dad, I don't wanna really help you out anymore. You don't have to pay me for this anymore. I'm gonna go hang with my friends. He goes, you know what, son? That's really awesome. You'll show up at 4AM, and I won't pay you now. And immediately what he did is he started to understand how important this was to his dad, and he aligned to his dad's hard work, and that's the point at which he chose, you know what? I this is so meaningful to my father. I am gonna get up every day at 4AM. I am gonna help him. And that's how he makes that choice every single day to continue to work hard. That's an amazing story, and he didn't have to think about it. I could tell it was from the heart. I could actually tell he probably told that thing dozens of times. I know inside of him that he knows how to work hard. So that's just another great example. All it takes is literally you sitting down for a few minutes and figuring out how do I put somebody in the state of something so that I can assess if they actually have that trait or not. So folks, those were the nine traits. We gave you four example tests for those traits. The remaining five traits, you'll see down below. There's a link to our nine trait interview guide, and you'll be able to see example tests you can use for the remaining traits we didn't cover in this video just for the sake of time. Now let's go through your interview process. How do you design an interview process to test for each of these traits? Here's my four step interview process. Step one is the recruiter screen. That's where we're gonna look at skills and experience to see if if they've earned the right to get into the rest of our process. The second part is the hiring manager. This is where you, as a hiring manager, pick your two most important traits, and if they don't have those, they don't go any further. The third part is the interview loop. This is where we start to bring in other people to assess this candidate. There's two parts to the interview loop. One are two more individual interviews where we continue to look for the other traits that this rep needs to have. So if I did two, then there'd be two more and then two more. Now we've tested for all six traits. I also do a panel interview here. We get a group of their peers or surrounding functions to make sure that they're a good cultural fit to the company. And then lastly, we have my talk them out of it interview. This is where I tell them everything crappy and bad about the job and why they shouldn't take it to see how much they want it. 99% of the time, people actually lean into the job more because you're being so honest. So let's start with the recruiter screen. It's usually a fifteen minute phone call. You're testing for experience. You're validating it. And then, like, baseline ability to hold a conversation as well. How do I run a good recruiter screen? Or if I'm talking to my recruiter, what should I be telling them to screen for? The recruiter screen is really important. Most recruiters are more worried about experience and information collection. So you really need information collection need information collection, but make sure that you do the information collection you need to do. So for example, I really like doing 10 rapid fire questions, like machine gun questions where we will be something like, hey, Arman. I'm gonna ask you a quick question. Give me the most concise answer you can because we just need to know a few things about you. For example, what's your deal size? 45 k. What's your win rate? 33%. What's your cycle time? Forty five days. So you can start to see, I'm just wanna get information. Right? I'm going through and I'm seeing, do they meet the criteria required in order for them to now go through hours of processing of interviews and scheduling and all that kind of stuff. So the pro tip here is how much are they explaining the numbers? When I did it with Arman, he was just like, boom. Boom. Boom. People that are great reps, they don't explain their numbers. They just tell you their numbers and then they expect you to ask them to explain it because they know that they're good. Right? When somebody's like, oh, my deal size is, 20 k, I think, but it depends on this. I already know that this person doesn't know their numbers, and they definitely aren't confident in what they're answering right now. That would be the type of thing that I would have the screener be looking for and a reason why we wouldn't pass them through the rest of the loop. Now we're on to the hiring manager interview. This would be you as the sales manager. You're about to interview this rep. Right? This is typically sixty minutes, but, Mark, we only do thirty minute interviews. Listen. Hiring might be the biggest impact on your ability to win. I would argue, Arman, that if you have the right person, even if your operating system and your operating rhythm aren't right, you might still win. That's right. So make sure that you give yourself time to get into a person to figure out if they're that type of person or not. Right? So, again, I'm gonna take the top two traits, the two most important traits, and I'm gonna make sure that they have those. Now in this sixty minute interview, I'm gonna kinda parse it like this. Ten minutes or so, I'm just trying to figure out do I like this person? Can they have a conversation? Are they actually gonna fit into this company? I wanna see, will they slow down and try to build a relationship with me? Or are they just, like, jumping into the interview, super nervous, not ready to do anything. Right? The pro tip here is in this part of the process, I'll kinda let it go for a while. But what I'm seeing is is, is this a rep that, like, understands that there's a purpose to this meeting? And will they eventually try to redirect me back to the purpose of that meeting or not? Right? So if they say something like, hey, Mark. You know, it was really great to get to know you. I'm real curious. Like, what are you looking for in a good rep? And they start to move into the interview themselves. Right? So that's what I'm looking for. Like, how long will they allow that to stay in the casual mode before they decide, hey, it's time to get back to business. The second part of the interview is a forty minute part, and that's where I'll do each trait. Twenty minutes each or so, but I assess each trait. And then the last part is ten minutes that we reserved for questioning. And I am looking for, like, what kind of questions they're asking here. So the pro tip would be, listen, are they asking selfish questions like, what how does the compensation package work? What kind of benefits do I get? Listen, we're in, like, the second time we've talked to you. I I don't know if that's a right question to ask yet, and probably a lot of it is inside the JD. So what I really wanna do is I wanna see, are they asking selfish based questions, which give me a peek into that type of person? Are they asking me curiosity based questions? Like, real quick, like, what percentage of your reps actually hit quota, Armand? That is a curiosity based question, like, that they wanna they're trying to figure out, can they be successful here? Not is, am I gonna make enough money to say yes and I have no idea if I can be successful here or not. Right? And now at this point, I've screened for the experience. I've screened for the top two traits. Now they go into the loop. There are three interviews in the loop. Two of those interviews are just basically this Yes. Interview structure testing for the remaining four traits. And then you have a cultural panel where you're testing for culture fit. What does that look like? The cultural panel can be done horribly or awesomely. Alright? Now horribly is we put them on a Zoom or in a room with three people, and it's three on one, and they're just kinda peppering going back and forth. Awesomely is if you're on-site, you set up lunch with three of your reps and you have them go lunch. My favorite thing to do at Outreach is we had this beautiful office with this really long, like, walking path right in front of the, the water. And what I would do is I would take me and a couple other people or send two or three people out on the panel interview, and I'd be like, go for a for an hour. And they would just walk around. I'm telling you, going on a walk with somebody, you figure out who they are and what they what they care about. So that would be ways that that are in person. If you're not in person, you can still do, like, the lunch thing. Hey. As part of this process, we usually buy lunch because we know we take a long time for interviews. So So we're gonna have a couple other people eat lunch, break bread together, talk shit, whatever. Right? That's a really great way to do it, but you want to create a situation where you end up having, like, a peer to peer not really an interview. We don't want them coming back in and be like, well, corporate value number two is hard work. We've already screened for the traits that we want. If they've gotten this far, they have the traits. We now are assessing, is this a person we want to work with that can add to our culture? And the only way to do that is, again, you gotta put them into a situation where they have to show you that they're awesome culture people. So at this point, you've done most of the trait testing. And now your final step is the sell you out of it interview. How do you run a sell you out of it interview? Yeah. I would say by this time, if you've gotten this far, you've had enough interaction with this candidate where you should start to feel some kind of connection. And I think what you can do is you can use that and leverage that to have a great conversation with them to make sure that they want the job. Because being good for the job and then being good for the company doesn't mean they actually want it. And if they don't want it, that's always gonna be in the back of their mind. So what we do in the talk you out of the interviews, I would say something like, Arman, hey. Listen. We've gotten to know you pretty good in this interview process. And I feel a little bit like I would be cheating you if if I didn't tell you some of the bad stuff so that you came in eyes wide open. Like, are you cool if we talk through, like, some of the reasons why this job is gonna be really hard? And then I would say, like, our top of funnel is really struggling right now. You're gonna have to probably do more prospecting than you do right now for the next six months. Like, how do you feel about that? Is that cool? And I'm gonna start to go through and get their reaction to adversity. And I'm gonna start to see what do they actually think. And what I'm looking for here is, at the end of the call, are they more enthused because I've given them more information and their brain is already thinking, oh, I could fix that this way and I could do that? Or do they seem like a little bit more withdrawn? And if they seem withdrawn, that means that they don't really want it and I need to probably deescalate that type of a candidate. So So I've got my four steps, recruiter screen, hiring manager, interview loop, sell you out of it. At the end, we have to make a decision. How do we do that? Well, what we wanna do is we wanna score the rep on a scale of one to four on each trait and on their cultural fit. You go around the room. Armand, what did you think about hard work? I gave him a four. What did you think about curiosity? I gave him a three. Alright. Great. We're not looking for all fours. What we're looking for is mostly fours. Right? If we start to see mostly threes, that's a soft yes. And there's one overarching rule when making a decision on hiring. Anything but a hard yes is a hard no. So we're looking for the preponderance of people, the consensus that this is a hard yes. If we can't get there, we don't make the hire. So go around the room, score everybody one to four on their traits, on their cultural fit. We average all that together. If it looks really good, we go after them. Right? If it doesn't, we move on and find another candidate. And if you get to a place where you just don't know what to do, it's really balanced. That's when you might trust your gut. Look at your gut. If it's saying take a chance, take that chance. If it's saying I'm a little hesitant, trust that and move on to the next candidate. Folks, don't try to logic yourself into a hire. If you see all these, like, threes, some twos across the board, there are a lot of times where you'll feel the pressure to fill a seat quickly. Do not. Wait until it is a hell yes. Every single time I've ever made a hire where it's like, I think they'll be fine, they end up just being fine at best. You are better off waiting for someone who jumps out of the water, and you're like, that's the one. Yep.
