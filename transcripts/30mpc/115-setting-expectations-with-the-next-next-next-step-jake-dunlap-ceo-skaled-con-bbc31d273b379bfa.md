## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Farouk. I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the one and only, the CEO over at Scaled Consulting. It's mister Jake Dunlap for round two. Nick, why should people listen? Jake's got some really powerful stuff around controlling the pace of the sale and who's involved in the sale and really having conversations that are planned and orchestrated. He talks about disarming objections in your proposal and then some really good stuff around getting very, very firm clarity around timing so you can actually not screw up your forecast. Three, two, one. Very, very firmly good episode. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? Rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Jake. Welcome back to the show. We start every single episode, as you recall, with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Love it, man. Really excited to be back, guys. Excited to share with the audience and hopefully get some people to president's club. So number one, a context around the demo that we call matching, which is very simple. If you want to talk about a feature, you have to be able to say, if you said this, you said this in the discovery, and now this is how we help. So if you can't do that, you shouldn't talk about it. Alright? Number two, most people blow it after the second meeting, and they do that because they don't set a strong agenda. And they have this big meeting with a lot of people. And instead of starting the agenda with, hey. After this, we're gonna have specific meetings with IT and operations. Instead, they turn it over to a champion, and then it gets lost in the shuffle. That's where we're the number one place we see people lose deals. Number three, if you want to have a proposal that wins, don't just send a proposal over that's like a order sheet. Make sure you always have a section that highlights the two to three business impact points that they said are most important. Those are my three men. Alright, Jake. So this has actually happened to a couple folks on my team at the end of last quarter where they got their champion to say, great. We wanna buy Pave. And every single week, they had a touch point with their champion, and we would ask, what's up with security? What's up with legal? No movement. Four or five, six weeks go by, and the deal slips. How do you prevent that from happening? So here's what happens. You get that big meeting with, like you said, IT and these other people. Here's how you start the meeting. Hey, Jake. Really looking forward to the conversation today. Today's goal is to really just talk through my conversation with Armand, give a high level on where we think we can help. And then after this meeting, we'll set up a separate meeting with IT in the next week or two to just to talk through some of the more details around security. Operations, we'll set up another meeting to talk about, again, how we usually integrate with your stores, your operations. And then if it seems like from those that we have a fit, then we'll bring everyone back together and see if there's a path forward. Does that work for everybody? Fantastic. That's it, dude. You set the expectation upfront. And that way when IT asks that stupid question about, well, how can this API that's a that's a super question, Nick. That's exactly what we're gonna talk about next week. So you keep that second meeting focused on the business partnership so it doesn't get derailed with all these other groups. So that's number one. I promise you all, just use that technique. Just set a stronger agenda and set the tone that there will be subsequent meetings to talk about non business related, more tactical details. So that that's number one. Number two, whenever you get into these situations, you have to be okay. Look. Sales, if it was called information giving, we'd all get paid a lot less. You get paid. We get paid in sales to have the uncomfortable conversations. And so, again, I trust me. There's many I I don't even know. Hundreds of champions who turn into blockers, which I love. We never talk about that, how champions turn into blockers because it happens all the time, is you have to have a conversation. And so here's what that conversation looks like. Maybe it's been, like, two weeks or something is you say, Nick, hey. Look. I just wanna have, like, a very straightforward conversation from working with hundreds of companies or how many ever. We know that if there's a path forward, we have to have at least a thirty minute conversation with infosec. Like, again, I'm just telling you, we have seen this. Again, you you don't make it sound out of the ordinary. And and, again, there's ways that you can set the precedent upfront in previous meetings, but before, that's what you have to say. Look. Hey. I totally get it, and I know that you don't wanna do that. But I'm tell like, just from our experience, it's not gonna work. It's like, would you feel comfortable based on where you are setting up a quick thirty minute meeting? I'll tee up a very specific email as to why. And then if it you feel comfortable, forward it along, and we'll set the meeting up. You just so you gotta be direct. And, again, you make it sound like not make it sound like you know who needs to be involved. So you just you tell them and you just say, look. This is my experience and how deals get done and who needs to be involved. So that's two kind of two ways to handle it. Hopefully, you deal with it upfront so it doesn't come up. And number two, and it does, that's why you get paid. That's why we get paid the big bucks is to have the tough conversations. I've seen you write about this in the past where people screw this up, where they say something like, I'd love to have a conversation with InfoSec. Mhmm. And when you use those words, I'd love to, it makes it seem like what you're proposing is not part of the standard process. And people don't wanna deal with your, like, shooting from the hip where it's like, oh, you'd love to do this, Jake. What you're saying is, like, I've worked with hundreds, dozens, however many number of companies, and, like, every single time, like, if we don't do this, this thing falls apart. I wanna ask you about this champions that turn into blockers scenario that you've talked about because I've dealt with it too where it's like my main point of contact, this was moving along, moving along, and now it's like they're sort of stonewalling me. They're not granting me access to other people. What the heck do I do in that scenario? So first, your preventative piece of medicine about how to to do this is you set the stage in the very first meeting. The very first meeting. It's like a first one or two dates. If you set the precedent that you're like, oh, yeah. I'll drive across town, and I'll do this and that and that. Guess what you're doing? You're setting a precedent. And, like, look. We might not wanna believe it's true, etcetera, but you do. Again, it's like, what do they say? First impression is everything. Right? So if in the first meeting, you say and you start the agenda. It's so silly. It's the agenda. Right? It's like, hey. Nick, I'm really looking forward to conversation. I've worked with two other people that are very similar, this and this. I'm excited to talk about the work there. But first, each organization I work with is different. So I wanna spend maybe five or ten minutes getting into some of the nuances, then we'll spend a bulk of the time talking about what we do at x y z. And if it seems like a good fit, then we'll talk about next steps, maybe looping in other people from the team. Okay. That's step one. Step two to prevent this is the first set of questions. It's gonna be like, great. So I work with lots of VPs of operations in industrial manufacturing. You know, sometimes they handle these two responsibilities. Sometimes they handle these. What are your top two? Then she or he tells me their top two. Great. Tell me about the team. As soon as she or he tells me about the team, I now can tell them who needs to be in the next meeting. So he says it's Nick and Arman. So then at the end of the meeting, I don't say, great. What are next steps? Instead, I say, great. So, hey. It seems like there could be a fit here. Let me tell you about typical next steps. So you mentioned Nick handles analytics. So, typically, what we'll do next is we'll set up a quick conversation with Nick, make sure it's something that he even sees value or might see utility in. Then if that seems great, it sounds like maybe we'll loop in Armand and maybe some more of the team, but that's typically next. So does that work? You know, we'll set up a meeting with Nick probably for, like, early next week. So if you wanna stop a champion from becoming a blocker, you become the project manager from the very beginning. You tell them the typical process. Just like you said before, it's no different. So, Jake, I'm curious. Sometimes what'll happen, especially with below the line folks, is they want to gain lateral consensus first. So instead of bringing you up, they wanna bring you around town to every one of their friends because they need to build peer consensus because they're afraid to bring this to their boss. So how do I coach my champion away from that and away from the demo train? It's the opposite. Embrace it. It is what it is, dude. We live in an era of consensus based decision making. Sometimes we want to short circuit and that and then then the champions goes on vacation, like, as opposed to me driving momentum. So what I would say is, like, at the very end of the meeting, again, knowing that, let's say, earlier, she said, oh, my team does this. It's actually very similar to that script I just gave you. Which, like, okay, Nick. Sounds like from your team, Armand and a couple other people, Jake, need to see, like, maybe a quick high level. So typical next steps, and we call this the next next to next next next, steps. So typical next steps is we'll set up a high level for them, make sure it's something they see utility in. Then if it ends up being like, hey. This is something that could potentially move the needle. You mentioned Kathy will ultimately decide, you know, where we move. If they see value, then we'll set up a meeting with Kathy. So at least she understands what a proof of concept looks like. No pause. Does that work for you, Nick? And so I want a split second response. I don't want you to sit there and overanalyze, like, what happens when he gets in front of Kathy, etcetera. So there's a lot to that. But, again, the next and the next next steps, and I'm laying those out. And I do that at the end of every single meeting. At the end and then I lay out the next two or three steps and the next two or three steps. So, Jake, one thing that I think is really important for the audience to note here is you're not just saying the next step is great. Your team's gonna see a demo. You're setting two steps ahead because the first one is the step that they want to take, but then the next next step is the step that you want to take. That's right. And so you're driving them in the right direction. Now my guess is you're gonna jump on this next call, and the step that they're gonna remember is probably just the next step. In other words, the step that they wanted to take. And so I'm curious. As you go from call to call, what does your agenda look like at the beginning of calls to say, like, hey. We agreed upon this last time, and this is where we're going in the next next step. How do you start to stitch calls together based on how you ended the previous one? So I think you're hearing a consistent thing, which is the way you set the agenda has a direct impact on what you can ask for later. So if, let's say, now I've got the team. I've got the team on the books. They're there. And you're there as well too. You're their boss. Great. Hey, everyone. Really looking forward to conversation. I had a really great conversation with Nick last week. So goal for today is, one, I wanna do a quick recap on some of the big picture items that we talked about. Two, get your feedback team. Two, we'll spend a bulk of the time kind of talking about what we do. And then, hey, if this is something that you guys you know, that you all feel good about, you see the value, then I'm gonna work with Nick, and, you know, we'll talk about setting up a potential proof of concept if it makes sense. Does that work for everybody? Great. You never just jump in. You're not you don't have to get up on stage and dance. Too many people, like, they feel like in that second call, it's like, oh, here I go. I gotta show no. Like, slow down, be confident, and so then at the end of the conversation, it's the same thing. Great. So tell me, John, how do you see value? Yeah. Look. I think this could be really helpful. Okay. Rachel, great. How do you see value? Oh, this seems great. Okay. Perfect. So awesome. So I'm glad that you all are excited about it. I'm gonna go ahead and send you both over a quick high level video. And then, Nick, it sounds like there could be some opportunities here. So why don't you and I maybe catch up for ten minutes? What's your schedule look like tomorrow morning? Cool. Alright. And then we can talk about next steps from there. Does that work for everyone? Great. Sounds good. Thanks. Bye. And then I'm gonna be like, great, Nick. So, hey. It seems like there's an opportunity here. Typically, again, we talked about this before. Like, we'll set up a quick conversation with Kathy. Here's why. I have a question, Jake. And I'm running into this actually selling sponsorships for thirty minutes to presidents club, where I'm actually doing what you are describing where it's like, tell me about the team because we hit on different drivers for different, like, marketing and sales orgs based on, like, what's important to them working with our media brand, you could call it. And I'll sometimes have a great first meeting with, like, a director of demand gen, and then we meet with someone on, like, the content side. And despite me doing what I think is right where I'm, like, sending all sorts of prep over and, like, it's well formatted, people are showing up to these meetings with, like, zero context at all, where it's like they have no idea what the meeting's even about. What do I do in that situation? They're not gonna read anything, man. Give up all hope. That's my advice. Like, look. It would be great if they would do their like, if people would read things. I come into this I never ask those, oh, how did you find us? How it doesn't matter. Doesn't I don't care how you found us. I don't care how much research. I wanna be the one to tell the story. So if if I had those meetings, Nick, what I would do is I would again I think a lot of people feel the need in that second meeting to start dancing, start doing the thing, talking about what we do. Here here's our stats. Here's how great we are. Hopefully, again, you'll see the pattern is this. Again, I set the agenda, and I say, great. So from my conversation with the head of demand gen, here are the top two priorities I heard around marketing. Hey, content manager. How do you see that? How does that play into your world? I need to get the ammo from them. I need to know what they care about. If you go into every meeting as opposed to looking to verify what happened in previous meetings, instead, you go into every meeting expecting everything has changed. You take that beginner's mind. I take that beginner's mind into every call. I assume everything has changed. I assume, you know, like, that each person has their own everyone needs to feel heard. If you want a deal to close, everyone has to feel heard. And so that's what happens is you start to jump into it and sell based on the reason somebody else told you, but you didn't get the reason so that this person cared about. So that's what I would do in that situation, Nick, because I would maybe take a step back and say, hey. I had a great conversation with with Jake, but, obviously, I wanna understand in, you know, some of your initiatives. But let's start with kind of a re quick recap of what I heard, and then why don't you give me your 2¢? So and then I would try to match it to the content person and what they said. So, Jake, I'm curious. This happens a lot in that third meeting when you're getting access to power. So Yeah. Your first meeting might be a champion discovery. Second might be a more a deep dive demo. And then that third meeting might be you're getting access to power. And that's oftentimes when you have to do a little bit of discovery and a little bit of demo, and it can get a little bit weird because I've brought four people along in the sales cycle, and I know I wanna do discovery on the CXO. Right? But these four people have already gone through discovery. Right? And so are you doing, like, mini lightweight discovery? Are you trying to break that into two calls? How do I, like, manage that executive dynamic when I've already sold to three or four people? I always do a prep meeting with my key stakeholders. So I'll say, hey. I'll say, hey. Help me to understand what are they gonna be the hot points? What are they gonna care about? I'm gonna start the meeting with the CXO. I'm gonna say, hey. Great. Rachel, I'm really looking forward to the conversation today. I've had two or three really great conversations with your team and excited to talk you through, you know, different ways that we're impacting ABC in the industrial manufacturing space. What I wanna do is spend the first, let's just call it five five to ten minutes, is I wanna highlight some of the, we'll call it, the key goals or priorities that I heard in those meetings. I wanna get your 2¢ on it. And then I say, we're gonna spend a bulk of our time talking about x y z. What does that tell her? This isn't gonna be an interrogation. This isn't gonna be some BS. And so then I do the same thing. Great. Hey. From talking to your team, Rachel, here are the top three themes that I heard as top priorities for marketing this year. What would you add? You know, how do you see these things? Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. And then I've already got my talk track laid out. Every company should have two different demos, a level one demo and a level two demo. A level one demo is a five minute. Hey. So, Rachel, you know, we talk about these things. Here's what that looks like. And so you can talk them through it, but you're visualizing it for them and you're visualizing the impact. Level two is like and here's the admin features. Rachel is never going to log into this platform ever. She's never gonna log she doesn't need to see the admin features or the alerts or, like, that that's what it is. So so then I say, great. So, Rachel, let me tell you a little bit about us and how we support executive teams like yours and and the frontline team here. So first, I'm I'm gonna show you a little bit about, like, the platform, but you're gonna walk through it at a very high level. Right? You're gonna walk through it in a way that that is like, look. So a Brad and Rachel, your team now is gonna be able to do this, which means this for you. You know, you're not talking about the features. They're translating the strategic impact from the tactical software or whatever you sell. You have to be able to run parallel sales processes, you know, which is like something that gets end users excited, but you also need to be able to level up and have an executive conversation so they can see the impact this is gonna have because they don't care about the features. I think too many salespeople, they just don't realize they don't know how to translate it to the what's in it for me. You put some stuff in the prep doc about that, the translation and the impact, about the impact in a proposal and what proposals like, where people commonly screw up proposals and what they should be doing instead. And I'm curious. Can you talk a little bit about that? You have to understand. You've had four hours of meetings with a person. And now what you're asking that person to do, what most people do then is they send, like, a whole bunch of generic stuff, and then they send, like, the products. Is you're expecting that person, and it's probably been a month, to remember all that, to, like, all the value props and the ROI and all that. And you're saying, yeah. Go pitch this to whoever. You're not teeing it up for them. So, again, what a great proposal is, very simple formula. It should start with the key business objectives. So then when I go meet with the CFO, I go, hey, Ken. You know how we're trying to do this? You know, an x y z and this and this. This company is gonna help us do that. And then you've got a few different relevant case studies. And then then all you do is it's very simple. So objective one becomes the first thing. You say, so objective one. So I you know how we're trying to increase productivity by 25%? Their x y z platform is gonna help us to do that by doing this and this objective two. So instead of sending, like, a bunch of products, you break out the features by the problem that they solve. So then I can go have a conversation with my boss. Objective one, here's how they're gonna help us with that. Objective two, here's how they're gonna help us with that. And objective three, here's that. Then you have to lay out the implementation schedule in the proposal. Business objectives, a few relevant case studies, break out the product by business case, and then implementation schedule. I'm gonna tell you the number one killer of deals is everyone looks around the room. They go, are you gonna do this? Are you gonna do this? Are you gonna do this? Sales does not usually feel comfortable talking about the implementation, whereas that's that's all I do. So I walk through the proposal. I say, great. So let's talk about next steps. Again, what do I do? I'm laying out the next next, the next next steps once you buy. Because that makes people feel like Nick's got me. He has a plan. It's not gonna be, like, throw it over the fence. I wanna disarm any objections. Like, my goal at the end of proposal, they go, okay. You know, I might not get the yes there, but, like, and it's not like a no questions, like, god, no questions. It's like I know I have disarmed every possible thing that they could possibly have objected to. Hey. How are we gonna go live? Already answered that. What happens next? Already answered that. How are they gonna help us? Already answered that. And so I think the problem with the proposal is we just wanna send out we wanna be lazy. We we spend all this time on the phone and we get lazy. We email the proposal. We ship it over. But just put a little bit of work in it, and I'm telling you, it will have a massive impact on your close rate. You spend all those hours up front. Spend the next spend that last thirty minutes to, like, you know, get the deal done and customize it. So, Jake, I think one thing that makes this situation much easier is when you have some sort of compelling event that's like, on this date, I gotta get live. Great. That means this much time for implementation. That means this much time for red lines. What do you do in a situation where the exec team loves your product? Your champion loves your product, but one of the things that can be scary about a deal slipping is there's nothing driving them to sign this today versus next month. How do you walk back a closed plan when there's not a clear defining compelling event to sign today? Many times people say, hey. So when do you guys need a a solution? Yesterday. Yesterday is when we need a solution. So one, when you hear that, you got that immediately has to send off alarm bells. Okay. That doesn't mean that means nothing to me when they say yesterday. I'm gonna keep digging in. Okay. Yesterday. Okay. Well well, let me ask you the question, Nick. Like, how long have you guys been in the market for a solution then? Well, we just started. Well, Nick, I mean, like, help me to really understand. Like, when did you actually need to have something in place by? Problem is, like, I just I think a lot of times, Armand, we just don't ask the difficult we we we again, I go back to why every deal I lost is my fault. Trust me. I've been in those situations where, like, yeah. We gotta get something in place by May 15. I'm like, yeah. Oh, this is May 15. And then the deal slips. If the deal slips, it's your fault. I guarantee you did not ask tough enough questions. You did not say in that meeting, hey. Look. What and, again, there's a classic, what happens? Oh, my goodness. What happens if it doesn't? Well, Jacob, we would be in a lot of trouble. That's not a good enough answer. It's not a good enough answer. Nick, look. I understand we wanna get something started sooner than later. The reality is, look. What happens if we wait a month? Like, like, what would, like is there really gonna be an impact? I just wanna get a sense of, like and and and I'll tell you this, and this is for kind of all your listeners. The other thing that when we work with teams, stop worrying about when they need to go live by and instead say, when do you need to see impact by? So go live is a date we care about because that's contract sign. Impact is what they care about. So instead, in that situation, Armand, I'd say, like, okay. So you need to be live by the fifteenth. Let me ask you this. If you want this to impact your revenue and whatever, when do you actually need to see the impact by? Well, if we don't have something in place by August 1, then okay. Well, look. Then let me just give you the timeline of what that actually means. That means we need to go live by here and this, and then I can go back to when you needed to see impact versus go live because that's what most companies don't know the difference. They don't know the difference of how long is this gonna take for me to see impact. All of those are techniques and things that you can use that will help you to cut through the BS. One more question I have for you. You mentioned the scenario where you ask Arman, hey. When do you need a solution in place? And he goes, yesterday. And then they tell you he tells you, like, got into the market last week, and it's like, wait. That's a big red flag, which is like, if you needed this thing yesterday, yet you just started looking now, that tells me, like, you're probably not really serious about this thing, and Arman is is probably not high enough at power and is kicking a bunch of tires. How do you respond in that? So, like, you talked about sort of sussing it out and, like, really trying to get to a timeline. Let's say you've got someone who's, like, you know, director level. Right? And you know you're gonna need them to mobilize and get you actually get you to power, but they've got this weird soft timeline, and it sounds like it might be a tire kicker. Do you just say, like, hey. Come back to me when you're more serious about this? Do you, like, try to go through a sales process? Like, I'm mindful of how I spend my time, and I'm curious how I should approach that situation. Well, no is the answer. No. That doesn't mean that someone's a tire kick. I mean, they did look. You gotta understand. Most people don't know how to buy what you're selling. You sell a podcast. How many podcasts you think the average company that you've, like, sold to has ever bought? And that's goes for a lot of you who sell software. Like, a lot of this is some empathy. They've never bought it. Your job is to help them and support them in this process. So if someone doesn't have it all figured out, I mean, to me, that's just lazy. If you're like, well, I don't wanna have to work for it. It's like, not an SQL. Come on. Give me a break. So so going back to it again, yes, part of it is just being more direct to say, like, hey. Look, Nick. Like, I totally get it. Again, one of the questions I'll ask instead of budget is I'll say, look. Let me ask you this. Have you guys already designated internal resources against this problem? Whether that's headcount, budget, whatever. Like, is this something that's a p one or p two or p three for your your department? And I'll just try to get I just try to get at that. And then if they're like, hey. It's a p three. I'm gonna, like, amazing. You know? Like, hey. That sounds, like, fantastic. Let me give you a quick high level on what we do. I'll get them real excited and pumped up. And I what I'd say is this. Like, look. And if things change, like, I'll make a note to fall up in, like, three to four weeks. If this starts to escalate or becomes bigger picture, but, no, I'll treat them like gold. I'll be like, hey. Awesome. Like, because it is what it's not their fault. It's not a priority. Like, it's just not a priority. So I'm not gonna try to oversell. I'm just gonna get you excited, and we always call it planting seeds. I'm gonna plant a seed like, hey, Nick. And if the next month this comes up, which I already know it will, then maybe we'll connect later. Cool? Alright. Thanks, man. And so, again, I don't try to force anything, but I also realize, look, it's my job in sales to really suss it out. It's my job to get to the heart of, like, is there something here, etcetera. But I never, man, I never look I I never looked at it like that, Nick. I never looked at it like qualifying or what it's just like it is what it is. It either like, the variables add up to there being something here or they don't. And it's not qualified or unqualified. And I think that's one of the biggest problems I see in sales is that. It's like, we're so focused on if it doesn't equal four, then it's not a good deal, and that's just not sales. You might need two or three calls to get it to a four or whatever it is. Jake, this has been a phenomenal one. We're running out of time, though, so we gotta move ourselves to the final question. Final question is this. We've talked about a lot of great things salespeople should be doing. Now let's flip that on its head. So the final question is this. What is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think hurts them more than it helps so they should probably stop doing it? Know your industry. Care about the industry you serve or get out. Go find some industry you actually wanna know the trends or those things. I wanna make you smarter. I like having business conversations. And so if you're a seller out there, be obsessed with understanding the trends in your space, what your buyers are going for so you can actually help them. If you if you don't know the trends, if you don't know what your customers are going for, how can you help them? You don't know how they make money, how can you help them? And so, really, I think put in the work to really understand and care about your space and treat every conversation like an opportunity to provide value. And if there's an opportunity, great. If there's not, that's fine too. Beautiful. Jake, thank you so much for joining us. Everybody go check out Jake on LinkedIn. I've been following him for years. Super impactful stuff. And everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Jake Dunlap include, number one, don't just set next steps, set the next next steps. Don't just set one step ahead, make sure you're constantly steering your sales cycle in the right direction. Number two, your second meetings should not be technical demo focused. They should be purely business problem solving focused. Number three, your third meeting or your fourth meeting when you get access to power, the way you structure that meeting is lead with the top three themes that you've heard from the team, but then ask, what do you think? And then you can get into your solution, which brings me to number four. When you do get into that solution with power, make sure that you have an exec demo that's, like, five minutes and then a detailed demo that's probably a little closer to an hour. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here? Well, in the beginning of this episode, we made a little small talk with Jake who's based in Austin, and he enjoys eating barbecue. And I enjoy eating barbecue, and I know Arman likes a good barbecue, and I was thinking, I'd love some barbecue this time of year. So if you're open to sending me a gift card to go eat some barbecue, I promise to send half of it to Arman. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes of president's club.
