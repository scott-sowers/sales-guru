## Transcript

What's up, folks? We're talking trade shows and in person conferences today, which can be the number one way to accelerate your pipeline if you run them right. And if you run them wrong, you will fly home disappointed with nothing but airline miles and crummy hotel food in your stomach to show for it. So today we're gonna be talking about the three big things that you should be doing before you even get on a plane to go to one of these things to make sure that it's an actually effective conference. With that said, pack your bags. Let's do this thing. So if you're expecting prospects just to flock to your booth ready to see demos of your product, you're actually gonna be really disappointed. Most of the success that you'll find at these in person events comes as a result of the prospecting that you do to set meetings at the event. Do not show up with an empty calendar expecting just to meet prospects. You've got to do the work in advance to pre schedule in person meetings. And so how do you actually do that? One, you should build some sort of pre conference sequence, call them, email them, make your subject line literally the name of the conference. Goal with this sequence is not to schedule a demo. It's not to have a discovery call. It is simply to meet for fifteen minutes. I usually try to set a coffee meeting because it's a quick stand up. Your goal is to make contact with folks and determine, hey, is there any sense in us talking after this conference? And so that's the goal of your sequence. Who are you actually going to be contacting though? If you can get the list of the people who are actually attending this thing, Of course, that is the best. But that's not always the case. You won't always know who's going to one of these events. Here's some ways that you can set meetings with folks even if you don't get the list. So number one, contact prospects who are part of the trade association of whoever's putting on the event I used to sell to law firm legal administrators and there was this big conference called the Association of Legal Administrators conference. And so I would just look to see who was part of the local chapters. And those are the folks that I would call and say, Hey, can we meet at this thing? So trade show association can be one of the best ways to figure out who's going to the trade show conference. If you don't have that, the other thing I might recommend is look at what companies are have speakers at these events that can often inform who's going. Two, look at prospects in the same geographical region. So if you're flying to San Francisco for an event contact all of your California prospects they're more likely to be there than your New York prospects are. And then three, just assume that your top prospects are going to these things. You're always better off assuming they'll be there and prospecting with the assumption they'll be at these events and hearing oh no I'm actually not going then not contacting them at all because you're unsure. So go after your territory assume people are going to these things They most likely are and I'll tell you I've even booked meetings with people who are like, Oh, I'm not going but I'll talk to you virtually. Awesome. That's a win. And so if you do this right, you should be going into these events with five ten, maybe even 15 in person meetings to get a quick coffee maybe drink decaf you don't want to be that caffeinated before you even get on an airplane. The reality is though you're gonna have a lot of prospects you can't pin down and so the next thing you should be doing number two of the things you should be doing in advance of these conferences is preparing to do what I call floor hunting. Floor hunting is simply seeking out the humans that you were not able to pin down a meeting with at the event. Yes, I know you prospect all the time. I just made you prospect to book meetings in advance of this event. Prospect all the time. I just made you prospect to book meetings in advance of this event. Floor hunting is in person prospecting, seeking those people out. Here's what you're gonna do. Step one, make a list of all the prospects you know are going who you were not able to pin down time with. Step two, go to their LinkedIn profiles and get their picture so you know what they look like. It's really tough to, like, hunt for people that you don't know what they look like in person. Step three, share those faces and that list with your entire team and tell them, hey, these are the people I'm trying to meet. Can you point me in their direction if you see them get your whole team working for you. And then step four, figure out where those people might be happy hours. Look at the other vendors that are going to this event and what events they're throwing a lot of them throw happy hours or like socials during these things. Ask your customers hey what are some of the events happy hours things that I should be going to where I should be looking out for folks. Oftentimes your customers will be your best source of intel in advance of these things. And then the last one is you might consider going to some of the speaker sessions. A lot of prospects go to those to learn. You should be going to learn but you should also be going to meet those folks floor hunting. The moral of the story is and you'll see when we talk about the next video where I talk about what you should be doing at these events is you should not be waiting for prospects to come to you, you should be seeking them out. You've got to live by the mantra here. If it's to be, it's up to me. So what we've done now, we've set a bunch of meetings by prospecting in advance of the event. Two, we've made a plan so that we can floor hunt and prospect at the event. The last piece is to reduce all of the logistical stress and noise that will prevent you from having the most effective conference. These in person events are stressful enough, and the last thing you want is added logistical stress on top of all of the selling that you're going to be doing at these things. So some tips to minimize the logistical stress. Step one, get your calendar right to get every single in person meeting, speaker session and event on your calendar and make sure to add transit time from in person meeting to in person meeting. This is not like your virtual zoom meeting where you can literally have a fifteen second transition from one to another, you've got to block off some time for transit, otherwise, it'll be late and make a terrible impression on your prospects. So get your calendar right. It should inform where you are physically at any given time. You shouldn't happen to be thinking about that in the heat of battle. So that's your calendar. The other thing that you'll do is as you're looking at the meetings that you have set, think about what's the key outcome that you actually want to drive with these meetings. They're not going to be like your normal virtual discovery calls where you might even show some of the product and you ask 42 questions. These are pretty tight, like fifteen minute in person meetings. So be prepared to run a much tighter meeting than you are used to what that will often include because you're going to be having a lot of ad hoc meetings if you do your floor hunting right is folks literally just having two minutes to understand what you do and should you meet after the conference and so get your elevator pitch down right. It should be less than twenty seconds shouldn't have weird jargon. They should know what you do and it should be an informal explanation of the problems that you solve. So get all of that right. Right. And then the last piece is the most stressful thing in the world is when you don't look the part at one of these and you don't dress right. What I recommend you do is sync with your team and figure out hey has anyone been to this before? What's the normal attire like? And if none of you have been before what I recommend you do is look at photos of last year's event that will often give you a sense of what the dress code is normally like. I like to dress one deviation nicer than everybody at the event, but that's just my personal preference. And so that's it. If you do all these things right you will get more out of four or five days at an in person conference than most folks would out of a month of an in person conference. So try this stuff. We're gonna be doing a bunch more videos on how to nail your next in person event. Let me know what you thought of this one.
