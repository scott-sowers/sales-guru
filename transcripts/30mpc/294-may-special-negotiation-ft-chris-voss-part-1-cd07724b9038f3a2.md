## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to a very special episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. I'm your host, Nick Sigelski, joined with my co host, Armand Farouk. Armand, we've got Chris Voss on the show, author of Never Split the Difference, CEO of the Black Swan Group. Why should people listen? Sounds like you thought this was a great episode, Nick. Yes. Folks, if you didn't know, that's what's called a label. A label is one of the techniques that Chris Voss breaks down in never split the difference where you label the emotion that allows you to get the other person talking and explain where they're coming from in a negotiation as opposed to being defensive or interrogating them. And so if you want to learn how to run a negotiation from the moment someone box that price all the way to the finish line and do that without causing any confrontations, we have a two part special for you today. Part number one is going to cover all of the ways that you can get them talking using things like labels early in a negotiation. It's the beginning of the negotiation where they're balking at price, and you need to unpack where they're coming from. And then part number two will cover the solutioning and the tone you should use in a negotiation. Once you understand what type of negotiator they are, what their interests are, Now you can start to use those labels and other techniques to drive to a conclusion, and it's key that you nail the tone here. So there is a master class on how to nail the tone at the end. And three, two, one. Let's ride. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, Chris. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. The first actionable takeaways, switch from trying to get yes to getting a no. You can reformat your questions where you're driving for yes and simply shift them to where the same answer is a no. Example is instead of saying, do you agree, say, do you disagree? Beautiful. What's number two? Getting a yes or no is to trigger a decision. Triggering a decision is not the same thing as being listened to. Doesn't matter if you're right. If you don't actually listen to people and show them that you've listened to them, they're gonna get tired of talking with you because nobody likes to talk to somebody who's not listening. Reminds me of conversations with Armand. Round us out. What's number three? Number three is don't make people wonder when a call is gonna be over. Let them know ahead of time how long you need. Ask for three to four minutes more than you need. Quit ahead of schedule, and you're always giving people back time in that day, beginning the person in the world that does that. I'm in a bit of a sticky negotiation that I'm wondering if you could help me out with. About seven months ago, I met with the CEO of this organization. And at the time, we were doing short term contracts. We would let people sign a three month engagement, and we don't do that anymore. And last week, this VP of marketing had called me and said, hey. We're ready to move forward, but we only wanna do a a short term engagement. We wanna do a trial before doing something longer, and that's not something I can do anymore. And I told him that, and I know we went back to his CEO, and they had a conversation. And I got a text from this VP earlier today saying, hey. Can you talk later? That's all the context I have. And so after this interview, I'm literally going to call this person. I'll use what you said about, like, hey. You know, setting aside the right amount of time. Is this a bad time to talk? What do you recommend I do in running that conversation? How should I think about managing that interaction? If they don't like it and you know they don't. That's why they're pushing back. Right? What it really is an issue of is value. You know, the the magic vague word that comes up over and over again. I'm starting out with a label, and I'm gonna say, seems like the value is just not there for you to do long term. Labels hit the brain differently than questions do, first of all. I don't know why. I just know they do. I don't know how gravity works. I just know that if I step off the top of a building, I'm hitting the pavement. I don't gotta understand Americans. I'm here to tell you labels of the brain differently. It doesn't cause them to stop and think. Now what question causes people to stop and think? Stopping and thinking is a good idea when somebody has enough mental gas in the tank. Typically, after 11:00 in the morning, you're starting to tap out the mental mental gas tank, and I need you to give me an answer. I get 05:00 in the afternoon. I'm not gonna ask you, you know, what's the biggest challenge you face because you don't have the energy to answer that. 05:00 in the afternoon, I'm probably gonna say it seems like you've got some pretty big challenges in front of you. What question has its own usage? I'm using a what question to shift your brain into specific type of thinking. So that's why you need to say, seems like the value is just not there for it for a long term deal. You gotta find out what's going on with the other side. Well, what happens, Chris, is when you said, seems like you've got a good reason for that. The way that I felt when I heard that was this person understands where they're coming from. It's already halfway there in the direction that I want it to go in. But when you asked what's the reason for that, I felt like I had to justify the decision that I already wanted to make. I felt like I was being questioned as opposed to being understood. Let's simplify it. Let's say someone comes in. You give them a price, and they ask for a 50% discount, which is bonkers. You say seems like the value might not be there for you or something akin to that. Right. What are the different directions that call that call can go from there? Well, I'm gonna back up to something that you said a moment ago that's, may seem subtle, but it's critically important. You felt understood based on a label. You said it seems like I use a label. It seems like it, and it made you feel like you understood. That's a critical component that I was talking about earlier as when people feel listened to. Here's what happens when you feel understood. Not when you are understood by the other side, but when the other side has made you feel understood. You start to get a dose of your own neurochemicals of oxytocin and serotonin. Oxytocin causes you to tend to bond with me. It also causes you to be more honest. Serotonin is a drug a drug neurochemical of satisfaction, which the more satisfied you are, the less you want. So you bond with me, you're more honest with me, and you're less demanding. That's why making people feel understood is, you know, I know Andrew Huberman hates the term hack, but it's a hacking mechanism to accelerate the process for us to get to a deal. And so if I say in return well well, Chris, it's it's not that I don't see any value in what you do, but what you're offering seems a little bit expensive. Where do you go from there? Well, if it's expensive, again, it's a value ish. Are you simply bargain with me because you feel like you have to? Or is there really an issue of fit? Now I gotta know which one of those two it is. In the hostage negotiation, I'd get asked by commanders on a kidnapping, when is this gonna be over? My answer is when the bad guys feel like they've got everything they want, which means they feel they need they have to bargain. They have to work for it. I if that's the mindset, cool. Now I understand. I'm talking about how somebody saying Al Qaeda feels. I'm talking about the feelings of a guy from Al Qaeda being a critical issue to the conclusion of the negotiation. The sooner I make you feel that you got everything you could, the sooner the deal happens. It's completely divorced from the actual timeline. That's gotta accelerate your feelings a hard work. So if you're bargaining with me just because you feel like you have to, and if you're if you're buying, that's entirely possible that it's related to what day of the week it is, What day of the month it is? What day of the quarter it is? Like, you don't feel good unless you've put up a fight till Thursday or Friday or, you know, what's your compensation based on? You gotta put up a fight till the end of the month or whatever your commissions are calculated quarterly. So I'm like, you know, these are the factors that make you feel like you've worked hard. Okay. Cool. I need to know that. That's you feeling like you got a bug. You gotta have to feel like you got a good deal. Conversely, if the fit's not there, I gotta know what that is. If the fit's not there, no matter what you pay me, you're not repeating. You know? Is is a suit that doesn't fit a better suit because you paid less for? It still looks lousy on there. You still aren't wearing that baby anywhere because you look stupid, and it doesn't work for you. It doesn't matter that you got it for a dollar. So if it's a fit issue, let's figure out the tailoring. Let's not rule out the possibility that the tailoring is gonna make it even more profitable for me and more beneficial for you. So I need to know which one of those two it is when you push back on me. And you're gonna answer you're you're gonna tell me by the your words and the way you say your words. And I gotta listen to my gut, follow my gut, not my amygdala. And whichever one of those two pass it is, I'm gonna pursue it. How would you figure out or what would you say to determine if it was a bargaining issue or a fit issue? Well, I'm gonna I'm gonna go back to this value. Like, if it's just too expensive, if you're hammering me on price, you're just borrowing. You know? You're not really thinking about fit. And I I actually I'm gonna I'm gonna work on you to teach you to think about fit. Because, again, if it doesn't fit you, it could, you know, it could be an Armani suit. It could be the best suit possible, you know, to continue with that analogy. The most expensive, the best looking, it matches all your colors. You know, it it it met it makes the color of your hair, color of your eyes pop, and one sleeve is the wrong length, or the pants are too long, or the waist is too big. You're still not wearing that big. Or if you are, you're going to a party, you're sitting down in a chair, you're pulling everything so it looks good, and you're not getting up because you're gonna look stupid as soon as you move around. And I need you to feel like I'm looking out for you. And you might not be looking out for fit, but I've got to because if I don't, you're not gonna repeat. Chris, the suit that you just described sounds exactly like what I wore to my junior prom, so I'm cringing a little bit right now. One thing that I think a more junior seller might do when they first learn about labeling in a situation like this where they feel like the other side is just, they're just bargaining, they're just trying to get a better deal, is they might label what they think is going on. Like, Armand, it seems like you're just trying to get a better deal. And I feel like if I said that and I said it the way that I did right there, the other person might react negatively there. And so I'm wondering if you can talk about, like, what are some common mistakes that amateurs make with labeling that a more nuanced, sophisticated negotiator knows to not do. It's delivery. It's tonality. You know? Get your words to land. Like, if I say, Arman, seems like you're just trying to get a better deal. You know, it's a little accusatory. If I were gonna say the same thing with different tone, I might say, Arman, seems like he's trying to get a better deal. Now the key to that really, you know, was slower, little bit of downward inflection, but the last word, upward inflect. And I'm more than happy to give attribution of awareness of this. You know, I I read everybody's book, The Way of the Wolf, George Belfort. Chapter seven is about a tone outlet. He makes a distinction between declarative and inquisitive. And when I read that, I thought that's a superpower. If you can go inquisitive, you could get some stuff to land that you might not be able to say otherwise. And on that label that I used just now, it seems like you're just trying to get a boatardier. You know, that's genuine deference, genuine curiosity. It's not threatening. You know? Derek Gohner, my team, talks about removing yourself as a threat constantly. Because if I remove myself as a threat, then you're more likely to work with me collaborative. You're more likely to allow the trust to build. You're not gonna do those things as long as I'm a threat. So my job is to remove myself as a threat as much as possible. Now the bamboozlers do this. You know, use your powers for good and not evil. My intent is for long term collaborative relationship that we both prosper. Chris, I'm the type of negotiator when I'm buying something that I always need my piece. I always need my 20% off. And even if the suit fits perfectly everywhere I put it on, I look like a million bucks, I don't show a single smile on my face. I sort of smug look in the mirror. I'm like, that doesn't look that good. And I come in and I get my 20% and I get my deal. But there are oftentimes deals if I was a suit salesman where I see the suit fit, and I know it looks good. And I know you know it looks good. But if I just call the person out on seems like you might just wanna get a good deal, they're not going to just buy on the spot because they don't wanna look like they have mud on their face. Right? Like, they were getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar asking for a discount. So from there, there's naturally some back and forth after that. How do you bring this to a resolution with someone who's just trying to get a deal for the sake of getting a deal? When you're thinking about the good deal in the moment, it's a short term versus long term. And I I gotta tell you something. I pay full price. I don't bargain over price with anybody. I want over delivery. I want somebody that I can rely on, who's always gonna be there for me. I don't wanna put my suppliers out of business, and I also don't pay the annoyance tax that everybody else pays. So if I got a long term relationship with you and you you were delighted when I walked in your door, next time you raise prices, you're probably not raising prices on me. You're letting the other people pay the enormous tax because I'm I'm genuinely grateful for great service. I'm easy to deal with. I don't pay the annoyance tax that everybody else pays in their life because I get a long term view. I love this concept of the annoyance tax. And if I'm in the shoes of a seller, what I need to make clear to my prospect is that if they cut the price by 50%, that 50% comes back to them in forms of the annoyance tax. It might be in fewer products they get. It might be in worse service. It might be in a, b, or c. But they're not gonna get the exact same thing for half the price. How do I explain that or articulate that to a prospect? Well, if you're explaining your loser and you wanna get that idea in their head, and this is what what the how and what questions are really designed to do, Plant tonight be in somebody's head. Inception, if you will. So my first question is gonna be is, how am I gonna remain to all types of you and over deliver for you every time if I'm taking a 50% cut of pay. Now the how question is differential. I'm not cornering you with that question. What I'm doing is getting you to think in a bigger picture with the how question. Like, you decide to take a pass on that. Alright. So that tells me a lot about you. Do I want you as a customer? And, like, you could say, you know, I don't care about any of that stuff. I don't care about long term service. I don't care what happens. My thought is like, alright. You're one of two people. You're the really a jerk, and every dollar I get from you is blood money. And I don't have time for people who are sucking the life out. So my response might be, look, man. I'm sorry. I just can't do it for you. And I don't like dealing with people who suck the life out of me. It's not worth it. It don't matter how much you pay if my life is miserable as a result. So I'm I'm gonna find out if that if that's you. Now the flip side, you could react like that because you're under tremendous amount of pressure, and I'm gonna get that gauge much more in the way you respond. The more genuine anger I hear in you, frustration, insecurity, concern about your own position, you're under pressure. So my I got a different response for that. I'm gonna say, if my guess is that you're under pressure, I'm gonna say it seems like you're under a lot of pressure. Because I don't wanna get you talking about that because potentially, if I can help rescue you from that pressure, if I can save if I can even recognize I'm in a different category and I'm people don't care about you at all. This feeling of being understood, you mentioned earlier, and then neurochemicals ain't true but as a result. So I need to find out which one of those two you are. You're gonna guide me. I'm gonna gather data with my eyes and my ears, and I'm gonna listen to my gut. I'm gonna see what's gonna take to work things out and also decide whether or not I don't wanna continue to to do business with you because I don't believe in blood money. So, Chris, you just talked about a couple different ways that we might say no without actually saying no or surprising or scaring them almost, making them feel like you're a threat or aggressive. You talked about the concept of asking, like, well, how am I supposed to do that? Which I think is supposed to get them out of the emotional state of trying to grind you down and into actually trying to explain the logistical details of how you and your business is gonna deliver on this thing, which when they realize, wait. That's like, it it puts them in a different space. So that's one way you say no. And then there's one other that I've heard from you where you basically say something the effect of your offer is generous. I'm sorry. That doesn't work. And I've always wondered about the piece the word generous. What is the rationale for telling someone that their offer is generous and then batting it down? It seems like those two things conflict. And so I'm wondering if you can explain. First of all, they think it is. Like, we might not think it is. But in point of fact, what typically happens in negotiations, they've compromised before they come to the table. Like, all non black swan trained people do that. This nonsense of a yesable proposition, which is completely different than a yes momentum. And, you know, let me construct a proposition that's easy for you to say yes to. This is literally the Harvard definition. So that no further negotiation is needed and we could just get all the things. But that's such nonsense. Like, first of all, you need to feel like you're involved in a process, so you're not gonna have any ownership, and you're not gonna be vested in it at all. Secondly, it's me assuming that I'm way smarter than you are and I know everything. For me to construct a proposition that requires no further negotiation, requires me to have perfect information, which is an impossibility. And even if I did, you I wouldn't have allowed you to participate in the process, and so you're gonna feel diminished by that. You know? There's two issues where people give us advice. One of them is we're talking down to them. We're treating them like they're not as smart as we are. Whether we mean to or not, that's the message that's being received by the other side. So, you know, I've I've got to engage you in a process that will collaborate. This happens a lot in the negotiations that I've done when I sold software where a buyer will come to me with three or four different asks. They want us to change our service level agreement. They want a special customer success person who's more senior. They wanna change on the license price. They have a couple different demands that they come to with come to me with. And and what will happen sometimes is I will come back or a salesperson will come back with a response to each of their points. Hey. We can't do this, but we can get to here. Alright. We've we've given on this piece. You're gonna have this person, and we'll come with a response to all their demands. And it sounds like what you're saying the problem with that is is, one, I'm crafting that response with imperfect information. But two, I'm crafting a response solely on my own. And even if I do have perfect information and I do have a perfect response, the other person feels painted into a corner because they didn't get to collaborate with me whatsoever. And so even if I can give everything somebody asks for or even if I feel like I can handle the response to their asks on my own, it is in my best interest to collaborate live with the other party so that they feel a sense of ownership in creating that solution, which might mean I actually get a better deal than the original response I was going to give them. The question I had asked was why you are calling their offer generous, and you started to answer and say, well, to them, it is generous, but I feel like I might be giving away leverage. I'm almost showing my hand even though I don't think it is generous in a way, and you are explaining why it's in my best interest to call it generous. Label you're labeling a positive, and labeling positives increases the feelings of wanting to be more positive. So if I say, you know, I appreciate that that was generous. You're gonna wanna be more generous. It's gonna encourage it. That that's the thing that actually really blows people's minds, the difference between labeling negatives and labeling positives. Labeling positives increases them. Labeling negatives decreases. They're like different ends of the magnet. And most people, well, if labeling a positive must increase it, labeling a negative must increase it as well. And that's one of the differences. You're labeling a positive. You're encouraging generosity on the other side. What you're almost doing is you are giving them positive affirmation for the behavior that you want more of. And I'm thinking about, like, one other way I might do this in a sales cycle is in a more complex sales cycle. A lot of times, there's a lot of work for the other party where they've gotta go communicate information with a bunch of stakeholders and get me documents and data. And I might tell them, like, I appreciate how hard you've been working on this. I know this has been a lot of time that you've invested in it, and, like, I really appreciate it. You've worked really hard on this collaboration. And saying something like that should then make them want to continue to work hard in evaluating my product, service, whatever, because I gave them a plus one. I made them feel good about the work that they put in. They're definitely gonna want that appreciation. I mean, they're gonna relax and giving it to them more than once. And and I became acutely aware this in a negotiation we're involved with recently. In the middle of the negotiation, I said, look. I know you guys have been really. I know you guys have been thinking about this a lot, and you you could've you could've asked so much more. You could've grabbed so much more, and you didn't. And I appreciate how much effort you put me in. My team, noticed picked up on a look of appreciation and belief across the board on the inside. We get done afterwards. I followed up with a person on my team, and I say, send a follow-up email expressing the appreciation for how hard they're working and their generosity. The response was, thank you for your. Now that's gonna pay dividends in the relationship and the profitability of the deal and the implementation, and I want those new. How can people follow-up with you? Yeah.

Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Well, folks, I would love to ask Chris another question right now, but part two of this interview begins right here next week. We're ending where we're talking about how you unpack the parts of the negotiation. And next week, we're gonna come to all the different ways you can solution a negotiation and nail tone throughout the rest of it. Alrighty, folks. Hang on. Sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode with Chris Voss. Number one, condition your prospect for future interactions. That means if you schedule thirty minutes and twenty five minutes into the meeting, show that they're willing to come back to you again and again and again. If you overstay your welcome once, you have poisoned the well in the eyes of that person for all future interactions. Number two, do not talk to people when they are distracted. If you can tell someone is distracted or if they're in the middle of something, reschedule, ask them to call you back later. It's not a productive use of either of your time. Three. First technique is a label. My favorite label from the episode was seems like the value isn't there for you when they ask for a massive discount. Number four, my second favorite question in the interview was, how am I gonna deliver a great service to you at half the price? What you start to do is you start to take away the value and introduce the annoyance tasks when people are trying to get a massive discount out of you. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? Well, if you're listening to this episode and if you've made it this far, it seems like you might value practical, actionable, concise best practices for sales. And if that's the case, I've got not one, but two newsletters that you might consider subscribing to. Chris shared his, which is something that lands in my inbox all the time and is really helpful for me as I uplevel my negotiation skills. And, Armond, I I know you've been hard at work writing a thirty minutes to president's club newsletter every single week. So if you enjoyed this episode and if you want more stuff like this in written, condensed, nicely formatted form, and if you're sick of hearing our voices, you may consider checking the show notes and subscribing to both of those newsletters. Alright, folks. We'll see you next week for round two with Chris.
