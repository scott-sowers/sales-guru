## Transcript

Cold email has changed a lot in the last couple years. And today, we're gonna be taking you through eight data backed cold email truths to help you book more meetings when a lot of folks are just failing on cold email. If you don't know who we are, my name is Jason. I run a company called Outbound Squad. We're a sales training firm that works with companies like Shopify, Zoom, Rippling, Gong, and a whole lot more. And I'm Nick Sigelski. I'm one of the founders of thirty minutes to presidents club where every single week we interview a different presidents club achieving sales rep to start to pull out the techniques and the best practices and the things that they are doing to make it to the top of the leaderboard. Alright. So this one that you wrote, you said, AI writes better cold emails than you. It just does. The problem, you're not giving it the right intel. Here's the three step play. One, educate and dig. Give AI everything you can about your personas, problem, challenges, call transcripts, etcetera, and tell it to dig for triggers. Two, write. Use this proven cold email format, less than 80 words, single sentence paragraphs using the customer's language. And then three, edit and polish. Add the finishing touches before you hit send. I feel like you you gave me a lot there, but I don't know. Give me some color on this one. I wouldn't have written this even a year and a half ago. Mhmm. I don't know what experimenting you've done with cold email, but I feel like a late adopter to AI, actually. I'm all in on it now. I use it for everything. But the emails that we're teaching teams to write with, you know, ChatGPT and Gemini and, maybe Copilot. I don't know if we wanna mention Copilot. It's, like, the hardest tool to use. It's better than 90% of what I see sales reps do that, like, do this every single day. And I think the big thing here is that I like to use this analogy of red pen versus black pen. And you just have to think about this simply through, like, mental caloric expenditure throughout a day and throughout a week. If you can use something to get you 80% of the way there and it's pretty good and you add the finishing touches on it, that's better than spending four or five times the amount of time to get something that's perfect. That two thirds of the time is not even gonna get opened. I mean, dude, I I was similar to you. I was really, really bearish on AI for a long time. Like, I go back and I listen to podcast episodes of ours, and they're like, you're dumping on AI. Do you still feel this way? I'm like, no. Because I feel like two years ago, it was just, like, really, really content. And I was like, my wife was using it for her social media job, and I'm like, okay. It just writes your Instagram captions, but, like, a real buyer is never gonna take this seriously. And I'll tell you one of the biggest turning points for me was when you and I were doing this cold email course, and you showed me how you prompted it with triggers. You've got it to do, dude, like, deep, multi pronged research way more than I would ever do as a as an individual rep, and I love your analogy around the caloric expenditure. Like, there's there's only so many sales calories you have in a given day. And if I can send out 80% good messages, that's a hell of a lot better than me going heads down and writing 12 amazing cold emails, 10 of which the buyer doesn't even see. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. The thing I'll leave you with is if you're not using AI to do stuff like writing emails and just things in your everyday life, it's kind of like 15 ago not using the Internet to research stuff. We don't have to put manual work into researching anymore. We have something that'll do it for us. So you say struggling to get replies? It's probably because you're prospecting like an AC unit. Predictable, rhythmic outreach. For example, one email per week, email sent to 9AM sharp. It feels like, quote, unquote, marketing garbage that prospects do now. Top reps prospect in bursts. Calls, emails, LinkedIn clustered together to spike the prospect's attention. Patterns equal ignorable. Burst equal attention. So what was the inspiration with this one? Okay. So this one is really gonna show my age, Jason. I I I still get the a physical newspaper delivered to my home every single week. I read The Wall Street Journal, and I was reading an article in The Wall Street Journal recently that was talking about leaf blowers. This post was inspired by leaf blowers. The reason that I made it is this article was talking about, like, why do people hate leaf blowers so much? Why are they such a nuisance? And the reason that they are is because it's it's literally impossible for your brain to tune out a leaf blower because it's unpredictable as it relates to the frequency and the pitch and the volume. Like, it it's something that your brain can't just, like, say, oh, that's a pattern I recognize. I can tune it out. Versus if you think about something like like a fan or an AC unit, even though it's making noise, it's in a rhythm, and your brain's able to say, oh, I can safely ignore that. So bursts that spike, it's really, really tough for us to tune out. And prospecting, I think about the same way. If you are putting your prospects on a nurture drip where you email them every Tuesday at 9AM sharp, it's easy for them to tune that out. And, frankly, they're gonna think that you're just like a marketing newsletter and you're on autopilot, and, frankly, you probably are. And And so one of the things that that we even saw when we put together some of the data here is, like, when you pair your calls with emails or when you leave a voice mail point to get your email or when you send a LinkedIn message and surround sound it with calls, that spikes on your prospect's attention radar and gets you so much more likely to get a response. Now it might not be a, hey. Let's meet, but I think it's an old adage in sales, like, any response is better than no response. And I do believe that to be True. Most of the time. I mean, it not only spikes your contact rates, it'll increase it by over three times just by simply connecting your channels together. And, like, I think you make a really good point of, like, if you sit in the seat of a prospect, you have to think user experience. Think like someone that designs products for a living. You think about the people that are using it and what that experience is like. What's it like to experience your outreach? Because if I'm an executive and I get hundreds of emails every week and dozens of phone calls every week, and and I get a one off email from someone every week or every other week, I don't know who that's from. I don't know if the person calling me is the same. Like, I don't see those as connected things. So I love that, like, make a lot of noise and then take a break, and then make a lot of noise across all the channels and then take a break. Like, that that's the way to do it. The one caveat I'll give on this one is there's a difference between attention and reputation. If I called you 57 times in an afternoon, I've got your attention, Jason. But that's like me taking a leaf blower and blasting you in the face at six in the morning when you're sleeping. Like, you're gonna be pissed off, and I'm not getting a meeting with you. And so use some degree of, I don't know, your EQ EQ on these ones. You want to spike in you want you want these to be spikes, not tidal waves. You want your prospects time, but it's the worst thing to ask for in emails. Reply rates drop by 44% if you ask for time in cold emails. Good CTAs are 28% more replies. Offers outperform interest based CTAs by four x. An offer is not a demo, a gift card, or a coffee chat. Real offers that convert include easy, pitch the blind date, medium, one to many offers, hard, one to one offers, cold emails that give get replies. Since the economy has really tightened up, like, there was this, like, high in 2022, and then it's dipped since then. And buyer uncertainty has been at an all time high. People are less proactive about buying right now. So what does that mean? They're less responsive to cold outreach. They aren't taking meetings for the sake of, hey. There might be something better out there. Yeah. So we've all seen the statistic that, you know, 3% of your market roughly is in buying mode. So how do you engage that other 97%? Because there's a portion of those that would buy something if compelled to do so. How How do you get them to take a meeting? You don't get them to take a meeting by talking about your solution as if they are already shopping for it. You gotta hook them with something that is actually valuable, and it's not talking about yourself, your company, or getting an introduction. The stuff that we've seen work really well, the easy stuff, the pitch the blind date is if you're my account executive, Nick, and you got six years of experience selling to VPs of manufacturing and I sell a welding solution, I'm gonna say something like, you know, if nothing else, I'll put you in touch with Nick, and he'll run you through some of the really hard to automate parts that I see that you guys are working on. And he'll talk about how some of your peers are dealing with a labor shortage right now. Like, that's a powerful reason to take a meeting. If nothing else, it's gonna be a good hang. I'm gonna talk to someone that really knows what they're doing. If you sell something technical, that's something you can implement right away. The other one I'll give you, these one to many offers are great. We're actually working with, one of our partners to do a really in-depth guide on connect rates broken down by persona. It's broken down by industry, by the day of the week, the time, etcetera. Like, that's a great give if I was prospecting. Right? Hey, Nick. We actually analyzed HR leaders, and we found a couple really interesting things. C suite is more likely to pick up the phone phone than a VP. Want me to send the rest over to you? I'd be happy to run through it in a call. Like, that's a really good gift right there. So you can leverage these, like, one to many insights. So you gotta think about how am I going to make this worth the buyer's time even if they decide not to buy my product or service? That's how you can massively increase your reply rates and your win rate for that for that matter. When you start a sales cycle off with giving value like that, you immediately put yourself in this trusted advisor seat that everyone wants to be in, and you're no longer gonna be commoditized. If your only ask is, hey. Do you wanna take a look at this thing? If they're not actively looking to buy, 97% of people are gonna say, nope. And you're SOL, and you're gonna burn through your territory really, really fast because you're only talking to people that truly are in market to buy today. But you and I both know that when you actually have the chance to sit down with a customer and understand what's going on in their world and maybe even reveal problems that they weren't thinking about, you'll have people that weren't ready to buy that all of a sudden they're like, can I give you my credit card? And so Yep. Your job is to start conversations with them. And so you have to have a reason to have a conversation that is more than look at my product, come check it out. And what you're doing is you're saying, hey. Even if you don't buy, here's the value you're going to get out of a conversation with me. So what we're doing at thirty MPC when we're prospecting for new sponsors, literally, our CTA is, hey. We put together a couple different campaign ideas for how we can help amplify your new product launch or whatever we saw they're looking to promote. Are you open to us sharing those with you? And we already have a sense when we're reaching out. We have a pretty small account list. But, like, I'll be honest, Jason. When somebody says yes, then we're putting some more thought into, like, alright. Let's send something really, really good because that's one way to start a conversation. This is what executives love too. You're never gonna get a meeting with an executive by offering to give them a free demo. We won't? What about a $5 coffee gift card? Old email mistake most reps overlook. Your first impression isn't the email body. It's your subject line, preview text, from name, mess one of those up, and no one's reading the rest. So you hit on something I think that most people don't even think about when they're writing the email. They focus on, like, the body and the personalization. Like, what am I asking for? So this first impression piece, what are you focusing on there? You could be giving away winning lottery tickets. But if your prospect doesn't actually lottery tickets. But if your prospect doesn't actually see that in your email body, if they don't open your email, you're not giving away any lottery tickets, Jason. What I mean by that is it doesn't matter how good your product service, whatever the heck your offer is. If you can't get your email opened, you're dead in the water. And there are three things that a prospect will use to evaluate whether or not they're gonna open your email. They look at the subject line. Everybody knows about that one. They look at the preview text, which is, like, the first 30 to 50 ish characters of the email, that, like, show up in in Gmail or Outlook. And then they look at who the email was sent from. And I'm gonna share later in this episode a little hack that I used to change who the email was sent from that honestly is, like, my number one prospecting tip. But if you can nail those things, you're in a really, really good spot, and you can at least get them to take the next step, which is opening your email. And so I'm gonna rattle off. I wrote down a couple best practices around subject lines. Here are some don'ts. Remove from your subject line questions, social proof, buzzwords like optimize, streamline, single source of truth, single pane of glass, numbers, and the word AI. All of those the data showed when you include that in a subject line tanks reply rate. The next piece around personalization, this is one that I learned from Charlotte Johnson where she talks about don't let your personalization get buried in your cold email. And what that might mean you need to do is flip your sentence structure so that your email front loads the personalization. So I'm gonna give you the exact same content in two different sentence structures here, Jason, that illustrate how you can flip your structure to front load the personalization. The first one is, Jason, I was researching your business, and I saw that you just opened an office in Tacoma on East Main Street. Problem with that sentence is the personalization or office opening in Tacoma on East Main Street is at the end of the first sentence, and so it might get clipped off. They won't see that until they open the email. A different version of that where you can front load the personalization would be, saw the Tacoma office opening on East Main Street when I was researching your business, Jason. So same sentence. It's not gonna, like, blow anyone's mind here, but because I was able to pull the specific stuff to you upfront, I have a higher likelihood of getting things open. So next one, stop being so formal with your cold email subject lines. Your open rate will jump by 10 plus percent with lowercase subject lines. They look more like an email you'd get from somebody you know. Try this. Summarize a macro problem every one of your buyers is experiencing. Do it in two to three words or less. One of our clients uses this subject line with 90% plus open rates, welders. This one was very validating, I would say, when we ran the data on subject lines. It supported short subject lines, all of the stuff that you just mentioned around getting all the garbage out of the subject line and not selling, and then also this lowercase thing, and I would always recommend this, but never have any data really to support it. It was just one off instances with clients. The idea here is that when you're doing any kind of cold outreach, what you wanna avoid is something that looks and smells like it's from a stranger. Because it's really easy. If you go through someone's inbox, one of the best things that you could do as a rep is ask your VP of sales or some other exec. Like, if you sell HR solutions, ask your VP of HR just to share their screen sometime and show you their inbox so you can see what kind of cold outreach they get. Yeah. And you'll notice that almost all of the cold outreach just screams this is a sales email. It's so obvious that it's a sales email. And the stuff that comes internally, a lot of it's, like, really short. It's hyper relevant to a priority maybe that they're dealing with or a common problem. It's not capitalized. Like, the email structure is really informal. Like, you wanna emulate a very human style of communication as if you know the person. So that subject line welders, the context for that is the number one thing every manufacturing plant is thinking about right now is there's a lot of welding that needs to get done, and the need for welders is growing every year, but the supply and people getting into that trade is, like, decreasing every year. So this is the number one thing they're thinking about. And, like, welders, 90 plus percent open rate. So you gotta think about what can we put in here that is just prevalent across what everyone that we sell to is thinking about or something that is about them or what they're working on, something that is relevant to the rest of the message, that's gonna be your subject line. When I sold to law firms and I sold attorney time capture solutions so that if they worked but forgot to, like, enter their time to be billed, it would remember for them. I would just make the subject line missing time because that was, like, a very common piece of language they would use. Like, oh, there would be a missing time report of, oh, you were at work, but you only billed three hours today. Like, did you forget to enter some time? That one was a killer for for getting opens at least. So similar philosophy there. Leaving voice mails that point to your emails doubles your cold email reply rate. Keys to success. Lead with context for the call, direct their attention to your email, incentivize them to reply, introduce yourself at the end. There's a lot there. Voice mail is one of those things I feel like that is so overlooked. We train so many teams, and we pull reps who leaves voice mails. I I'm not shitting you. Two thirds of them never leave voice mails for all kinds of reasons. The number one being, well, they never call me back, Nick. Nick. They don't. I think I've gotten three callbacks in my entire career. If you're leaving voice mails and expecting a callback, you're just gonna be horribly disappointed. So we saw this when we published cold calling sucks that, like, voice mails have a dramatic impact on our cold emails. And then we saw it even further when we did this analysis with the Gong on all of these cold emails. I'm I'm actually gonna share, like, a really practical real world example that we're we're seeing in in practice at 30 MPC. So you might know Jason that we hired our our first AE at the beginning of the year, Alex, and he had a killer June. He booked 20 outbound meetings in June, and he's a full cycle AE. We sell to marketing leaders. And believe it or not, everyone's like, oh, selling to marketing is easy. Nook's recently published some data on pickup rates across different personas. Do you wanna know who the lowest pickup rate was on cold calls? Dude, it was marketers. Below finance and below security, marketers had the lowest pickup rate. Wow. Alex is still booking meetings because of the voice mails and cold calls that he is making. Most of his responses, I'll be honest, come in response to the emails that he's sending, but he is telling me that, like, it's usually not email one that gets his response. It's email two or three that come immediately after a after a voice mail where he's like, hey. No need to call me back. Like, he'll usually say something like, Jason, I just saw the big launch of your new AI Copilot and your product. There's no need to call me back. I'm literally about to hit send on an email to you with a couple ideas. When When you get a second, if you wouldn't mind taking a look at that and letting me know if what I sent over is even moderately interesting, it's gonna come from Alex at thirty MPC. He is getting so many more opens because of that. So stop using voice mails as a mechanism to beg for a callback. Instead, use them as a mechanism to drive to your cold email where you will get a response. Love it. This is such an easy one to put into practice. So this next one here was, breakup email. I used to hate breakup emails. The whole did you get eaten by a crocodile thing was super cheesy. I never saw that as a way to engage with execs. But love them or hate them, breakup emails increase reply rates by 89%, and it's all about being professional while giving the prospect an easy way out. Hey, Craig. I shared a few ways to reduce startup build times, but I'd hate to keep reaching out if we weren't a fit. Mind letting me know if this is relevant or not? The sequence has come to a point to where you have to have some sort of finality to at least right now Yeah. In what you're doing. And I never like the pick from these options list. I'd always thought it was super, super cheesy and, like, no exec that I sell to would respond to that well. I wanna break down that email in there. The, hi, Craig. I shared a few ways to reduce startup build times, but I'd hate to keep reaching out if it weren't a fit. So that I shared a few ways too. That's got to point to the number one priority or problem that is most prevalent for that type of persona. Or if you have some specific research, you bring that in there. In the mind letting me know if this is relevant, it's got the no oriented question in there. You could also say, let me know if this is not relevant, and I'll stop reaching out. Give them a roll forward, right, for replying to you. But this, I found, is just did it's a really great way to get replies. And oftentimes, the replies are gonna be, sorry. Been really busy. You mean to get back to you. Yeah. Let's chat. Or what's this about? It's like you get some sort of engagement that you can work with. And the number one thing I would say is if they don't reply and wanna book a meeting, pick up the phone and call them. That phone call now has so much more relevance when you know that they've gotten the email and seen it. That's a big one I've learned from you, which is stop trying to handle objections over email. If somebody responds, unless it's like a all caps, fuck you. Never email me again. I I'm probably, I'm gonna be honest, not gonna call that person. Like, call them and you have a reason to start a conversation at this point, and that is when we were talking about, like, the spike on the attention radar. Like, that's an awesome time to say, hey. I'm a human being, and I'm trying to have a conversation with you here. Last but not least, most sellers obsess over subject lines of preview text. There's a little known third thing that has way more of an impact on open rates, sender name. If your prospect recognizes the name, they'll open it no matter the subject line. Subject line. The play, borrow trust. Find a prospect's mutual on LinkedIn. Ask for permission to draft a message. Have them send it. Okay, dude. I'm dying to know about this one. As I mentioned earlier, this is legitimately the number one prospecting strategy I've been using. And the reason that I've been using it is, dude, I hate putting high effort into a cold email or an outbound message and having it fall on deaf ears. It's just, like, it's really, really defeating. And so, yes, subject line. Yes, preview text impact whether or not somebody opens your email. But I'll be honest, Jason. Like, if you email me, if the sender name is Jason Bay, I don't care what the subject line or preview text is. I'm gonna open the email because it's you. You're my friend. Like, we we we do, like, business together. Like, we have a relationship. Again, you talk about thinking about the prospect experience. If they get an email from somebody that they know and trust, they're going to open that email. A lot of sellers know you're supposed to ask for referrals, but if you just go to let's say, Jason, I'm prospecting to Armand, and I don't know Armand, but you know Armand, and I'm trying to get you to connect me with him. If I just go to you and I'm like, yo. I saw you know Armond. Would you be open to connecting with us? If I put in low effort like that, it's gonna be kinda hard for you to, like, give me, like, yeah. Maybe. But I'm not sure what you're asking about. And then you might send a shoddy message where it's like, hey. This Nick Sigelski guy asked for an introduction to you. Are you open to talking to him? And there's so much to be lost in translation. And so what I do is here's my process. Find the prospect I wanna talk to. Go on LinkedIn, and I use Sales Navigator for this. I look for people that they worked with before. It's a waste of your time just to go through mutual connections because nowadays, people have such big networks on LinkedIn. You'll see somebody where you've got 80 mutual connections and really only three shared ones. So my way to shortcut this is I look for people who used to work together. Then what I'll do is I go to the person that I want an introduction from, and I will send them in three separate messages. I don't just copy and paste the template. I send three separate messages to make it feel more organic, and I'll say, Jason, I know this message is totally out of the blue, but I'm wondering if I could ask you a favor. I'm prospecting into AcmeCo, and I see you're connected with Jane Smith over there. I thought they'd be a good fit because they just opened a new office in Tacoma, and we actually work with a couple other firms who are establishing presences in Washington state. If you indeed know Jane and you feel comfortable with it, could I draft a message for you asking permission to make the introduction? So if I break down what I did there, I'm acknowledging message is totally out of the blue. I'm prospecting this company. I'm really clear with my intentions, and I see you're connected with this person. And I know you I think you worked with them before. And then what I'm doing is I'm saying the reason for why I'm reaching out. They just opened this new office, and we're working with other people like them who are growing in the state of Washington. The CTA is really specific here. I am not asking for them to connect us yet. I'm asking for permission to draft a message for them to send asking permission to make the introduction. So what I'm showing is, like, I don't want you making an unsolicited introduction, which I've had people do for me before. Like, they were like, yeah. No problem. I just made an intro. And the prospect is like, woah. I didn't agree to this. And I'm like, it's weird. You actually have to teach people how to make introductions. But then two, I get to control the way that they are framing my ask, and I get them to send a killer prospecting message on my behalf. So hopefully, that was clear. I feel like I made it more complicated than it actually is. No. I love that, though. The the offering to GhostRite, it's like it's gonna remove any confusion around why you're reaching out and, like, why you think it makes sense because you can do that way better than them, and it's coming from that person. Yes. And you're allowing them to red pen. Yes. That's the thing. Don't make them work from scratch. Love it, dude.
