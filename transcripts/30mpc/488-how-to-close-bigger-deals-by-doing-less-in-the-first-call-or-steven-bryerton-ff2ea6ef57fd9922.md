## Transcript

For a long time, my best sellers, while, yes, they got, like, the larger enterprise accounts, so much of what they did was in giving them the great SMB accounts. What we started to see when we segmented where we said, hey, you're an enterprise seller. That's all you're gonna do. Enterprise accounts. You're an SMB seller. That's all you're gonna do. The win rate dynamics started to shift, like, materially. And so what you would expect, t zero win rate should go up and up, and those older win rates should increase. And so what we started to see, hey, the trailing three month win rate overall, while it's flat, we actually moved up the t zero win rate. In the mid market segments, the t zero win rate fell dramatically. And so while those older win rates are moving up in the right direction, in aggregate, it wasn't enough to, like, actually boost the total win rates, but it's the right outcome for the business. And today, for a round two, this time on the leadership show, If you've ever wanted to close a big deal, well, guess what? You're not gonna get there by posting $2 slices on your menu board. You gotta slow down your deals, and you gotta teach your team to close big deals. And Steven Brierton, the SVP of sales over at ZoomInfo, is putting on a step by step guide on how to take your team from closing tiny deals to bigger deals. Mark, why should people listen? I think this is a really interesting conversation with somebody running sales at a scale that's humongous, at a company that really has a strong scientific type of DNA. And we get into this interesting thing of how do you balance a big deal with getting a deal done. And I don't think that that's a very common conversations that you hear a lot. So I think you'll really enjoy what we what we talk through. And three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, Steven. Welcome back to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Number one, I wanna measure my win rates by time cohort instead of a a collective overall win rate. So what does that mean? One, I'm gonna look at when we win things versus when they were created. So a t zero win rate is going to be the stuff that I win this month that I also created this month. My t one win rate is gonna be stuff that I win this month that I created last month and then so on and so forth. And so depending on the segment that you sell to, it can be three, five plus. But, really, what does this allow me to do? I get to get a better understanding of deal velocity, especially within segments. I get to understand where we're performing and sort of why if I'm gonna go affect an outcome. It might be is it near term pipeline or is it in my older pipeline? At the rep level, I get to get a better view on where I might be able to coach a seller. So if they have a really high t zero win rate, but their older win rates aren't very good, well, then I might be able to to pick in, out items from their calls that they're trying to close too quickly. They're not providing enough value longer term. They're not, you know, multithreading. And then lastly, it allows me to identify trends. So if I had a really high t zero win rate three months ago, and then it carried into a higher than average t one and higher higher average t two, I get better aligned with my my sales development team and my marketing teams because now I can understand, hey. What did we do in that time frame that is allowing it to carry on here in the future? That was a great t one takeaway. What's your t two takeaway? Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Alright. See, two takeaway. I wanna look at win rates by deal action. So, again, as you start to think about not just are we winning deals, are we winning deals, the right way, and are they forecasting to come in on the right time horizon? And so rather than sort of coach to a series of metrics, I'm gonna sort of look at the overall health of the the deal to understand, are we winning at a higher rate or not? So it might be things like, did we get a sales engineer involved in the call or a solutions consultant? Did executive leadership join a call on their side or on our side? Did we create a business case? Have we run a proof of concept? Identifying all of those things in the deal then helps me, one, forecast if this deal is real or not when the rep might be telling me. Two, is the deal going to increase in size? Right? If we haven't done all of the those things, I can start to see, hey. This should grow, and close at a higher rates, or a higher dollar value. So now I start to see, like, am I waiting on the right time horizon? And are we also running the right motions and the and the right activities within our deal sets? Alright. Bring on what's number three? I wanna look at these on a, like, a daily pacing. Then your business might be different. So for instance, while I look at these in aggregate on a daily pacing level, the daily metric is less relevant for my enterprise team. You know, I'm looking at more along a quarterly, cycle versus my SMB team that daily matters. But the things that still do matter on a daily pacing for for us, is our, pipe created across the segment. What did we create today, and how does that compare on the same workday, in prior months, in prior quarters? Number two, what did we close today, and how does that compare against those prior periods? And then three and four are going to be those win rates that I mentioned earlier, t zero one two three, so that I can understand, again, if I'm gonna go affect the outcome in a given month or a quarter, where is an area that we might wanna laser in on, where there might be more upside. And then number, four, the last one is gonna be the average sales price. Again, this is going to deviate based on segment, but it does start to tie into those win rates, so that you can start to see, are we holding out for too big of a deal? Are we closing too quickly? And how does that compare in months past? There's so much information in there. I'm curious, though, when you are doing something that kind of niche and specialized, there's all of these other win rates and stuff. How are you how are you managing, like, overall win rate? Now I got this cohort win rate. I have we we talk about the deal action win rate. Like, it's a lot to synthesize. How are you pulling it together? Yeah. So I think when we look at the business collectively, what we'll look at, we'll sort of, we'll sort of bunch them together to get, like, a high level view. But then when I need to diagnose or understand, like, why are things going well or why aren't things going well, or where can we go to get better, then we start to break it down thereafter. We'll look at a trailing three month win rate, and that's gonna be the thing that we're gonna show, like, in the executive leadership meeting, you know, with our CRO, with their CEO, when we're sort of doing, like, a monthly recap. We'll just sort of take that. And, again, how did that compare to last month, last quarter, and so on and so forth? Because then we can see we're moving in the right direction or not. And then within that, this is where, like, you start to get a better sense of, of things. For instance, we segmented in our business. So for a long time, my best sellers, while, yes, they got, like, the larger enterprise accounts, so much of what they did was in giving them the great SMB accounts. And so what we started to see when we segmented the business where we said, hey. You're an enterprise seller. That's all you're gonna do. Enterprise accounts. You're an SMB seller. That's all you're gonna do. The win rate dynamics started to shift, like, materially. And so what you would expect in an SMB, the t zero win rate should go up and up. They're optimizing for velocity. The enterprise t zero should go down, and those older win rates should increase. And so what we started to see where we could see, like, hey. The trailing three month win rate overall is, is flat, let's say. Now that might feel good or it might feel crappy depending on your your point of view. But what it allows me to do then is to say, look. While it's flat, we actually moved up the t zero win rate. In the enterprise segments or in the mid market segments, the t zero win rate fell dramatically. And so while those older win rates are moving up in the right direction, in aggregate, it wasn't enough to, like, actually boost the total win rates, but it's the right outcome for the business. So flat is a good outcome in this case. Yeah. You said that the enterprise overall win rate stayed about the same. For round numbers, let's call it 33%. Right? So you're winning one and three deals. But because you were winning more enterprise deals in later teas, for example, like, three month enterprise deals versus zero month or in month enterprise deals. Yeah. Yeah. My guess is your win rate stayed the same, but your deals got bigger because you probably weren't closing $10,000,000 deals in fifteen days. Right? So you wanted to make sure that you won the same number of deals and you kept your overall win rate constant, but you shifted win deals or won to a three month time horizon, which meant you were properly taking the time to close a big deal, not a quick land deal. Is that 100% accurate. Yeah. Like, it's exactly right. We focus in the the enterprise teams. Their big thing that they're setting their sights on is ASP. And so is that deal size increasing over time? And, you know, you wanna sort of find that that balance between ASP and win rates. And you're right. Like, they were, so quick and operationalized. And but in the old world, they were sort of they were incentivized to to win quickly and go on to the next one and the next one and the next one. And the pain of going through procurement in a large enterprise for a deal that, like, gets over certain thresholds wasn't worth it to them. It's a great outcome for the business, but it wasn't worth it for them. And so that's where having those things at my level, at my VP level, my director, and my manager. And so we're all coaching to that. We could start to change the behavior and then obviously dictate, you know, plans, etcetera, around it to benefit the sellers as well. I think that kinda leads into my next question is, you know, some metrics are for leaders. Some metrics are for reps. You know, some metrics guide strategy. Some metrics guide, you know, how a rep wants to self coach. Where where does this one land? It's it's much more of a leader metric to diagnose what's going on in the business and, again, where do you go and, where do you go and and sort of put your thumb on things to improve things or stop bad behavior, right, as well? Where it translates for the sellers, it it does ultimately tie into their ACV closed. And so, like, we ultimately can have the discussion with them around, like, look, enterprise sellers, you missed quota by whatever, a 100 grants. And while, yeah, you you closed more deals than your peers did, and you could see that in, like, your quick your quick cycles, where we need, to help you is, you know, driving more value. Like, and that's where you start to see in comparison to peers, we extend those sales cycles a little bit. I I know that feels uncomfortable. But if we extend them a little bit, the deal, you know, grows. And then you don't need 10 deals to hit your number. You need seven. And you they can just be the higher quality. They had this sense that you were closing deals. This sounds like a misnomer. That you're closing deals too quick. Right? And then you wanted to raise ASP, right, which meant you need to slow deals down, build them up, all that stuff. So you notice this in your win rates. You noticed it in your ASP. You have a metric that's clearly assigned, like, we wanna grow ASP ASP by this much. Could you walk through, like, what were some of the other things you did with your sales team to get them ready to close bigger deals that might have been coaching, that might have been a certain sales process? Like, how did you get them to raise their deal size? Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive goes to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. We started to adopt a sales methodology, you know, medic or med pick. You know, every organization's a little bit different. We found that that one started to work, well for us, and then we, you know, we started to operationalize around that. So our, you know, our, call recording software with Chorus, we would start to have those things ingested into Salesforce on the opportunity object. So when we were doing deal reviews, we could understand, like, oh, they don't they don't have an economic buyer yet. We've got some shoddy sort of metrics. Right? And so that that led to greater discovery, and sort of deeper level conversations. We we coached around those behaviors. The others were we did institute a forecasting solution to help give that visibility as well at the leadership level, frankly, and at the the rep level as well so they can manage their pipeline a little bit better. We, work closely with, our marketing and SDR counterparts. So marketing, you know, we worked with them to start to put in together more ABX campaigns and, you know, event strategy and the whole 90 yards, getting people on-site. Right, there was a lot of that. We looked at our SDR comp plans and started to reorient the that SDR team, again, around bottom of funnel activities, ACV closed, put in some prequalification metrics. It wasn't about, you know, get me 20 meetings a month anymore. It was about give me five great meetings, with with these personas. So it was really a holistic approach. So let's break this down step by step because I think there are there are a couple of really important changes. If this was like a playbook on how to get your team to close bigger deals or close upmarket deals, you broke down three big areas. The first big area in chronological order is you taught your team to generate big deal pipeline. Right? So that was work working with marketing to not just run a million, like, paid ad campaigns, but do, like, ABM and events to get in front of big accounts. You made sure SDRs weren't prospecting into if the employee band was, like, 500 to 2,000, they weren't getting all of the 501 employee companies and, like, the the single team deals. Like, I've run SDR teams. I know how that game works. Right? Yeah. Yeah. That's the pipeline piece. And then you talked about some things that you had your reps doing around discovery to, like, build bigger deal problems, and then the third piece was forecasting. So you cover them in that order. Let's start with, like, the pipe gen piece. What specifically did you do in the SDR comp plans? Like, what were they doing before? And then what did the SDR comp plans look like afterwards? And I'm curious, like, the behavior change that occurred. The big ones so before the SDR component, because it it does tie very much into the pipeline, generation, it was a major exercise in prioritization. Like, to your point, it's a bunch of thousand plus employee companies or a 100 employee plus in companies, which are the right ones to be in front of and why. That was the major, that was, like, big step number one. Obviously, I'm very lucky and spoiled at ZoomInfo to have a line of sight into that data. But, if you're not at ZoomInfo, we can certainly help you. But we still was like still a reader. Yeah. That is that is that was the first one, the prioritization, which accounts now and why. And then that's not a stagnant list. Right, like, looking at signals and all of the other things, market changes around, Look, in q two and q one, there was a lot that changed geopolitically. And so, like, you know, we rack the deck. So that's I think that's number one. To to your question on the SDR stuff, before, it very much was a volume gig. They you know, if they were an outbound SDR, which we have them broken out by inbounds and outbounds, if you were an outbound SDR, you could You were still tied to revenue. You would get a small commission, if a deal that originated from your outbound meeting closed. But so much of, like, your comp and accelerators were on the front ends on a good fit meeting completed. And so they started to realize, like, hey. I can rack up a decent commission check by just getting a large volume of meetings. And so we worked with our SDR leadership team to sort of restructure some of that. Hey. Let's lower the meeting complete target, substantially. Let's introduce, some qualification where, we both agree that this meeting shouldn't be a completed good fit that results in an opportunity because that was always a tension point. Like, what's a good, fit for for you and your definition might not meet Mark's standards. Right? And so we standardized that of these are the things that are a good fit complete is. And then that way, there was no more tension between I shouldn't say no more. There was less tension between an SDR and an AE, and we all just agreed that, like, yep. You still have work to do before this counts. That was the biggest one. I'm just sort of re resetting some of the definitions and then reallocating the comp plan to be, you know, more on that that closed one revenue and and pay more because they have to do more qualification per meeting, but lower the target significantly. Like, how did you activities today Yeah. And aren't like, yeah. You know that meeting that I booked five months ago, I'm just gonna ride that payday today so I can cruise. Like, how do you balance that? Yeah. I think there's still, the balancing act is still they're not they're not done once they sort of set the meeting. So especially in enterprise and as you move up market, on our team, as an SDR, there's that progression as well. So you go from, like, SMB to mid market to an enterprise SDR. The highest you know, once you start to get to mid market enterprise, you get paired one to one with an AE. And so they do have this this tight connection where you are working the pipe together. And we still have, like, a a concept of what we would call, like, a demo too. You know, other people might call them, like, a a further qualification meeting where if, hey. You got me, Armand. But I and you go now who leads sales, the SDR team, as you said earlier. But if you go get me the director plus on marketing, like, we're still gonna have a compensation component there for you. Because now, theoretically, the deal should be growing. We should be getting more stakeholders, and so that should start to accelerate. Right? We're we're getting a bigger problem. That's part of the way that we square some of those things with, pipe progression, and they still have a hand in it to then result in the close. So you're you're comping STRs for helping create multi threading and stuff in active deals? There is a component. Yeah. For sure. So this is one that's gone, like, if you look at our comp plans, it sort of goes back and forth. Like, we've had it. We've taken we've taken it away or we've taken it down. We've put it back in because we are, you know, by segment trying to balance, you know, the right right motion. SMB, it should really just be about demo ones, pipe creation. You're you're a 10 comp person company. That's that's on the account executive for go finding other people. Right? But as you have a larger account, a larger book of business, that is a lot of work to go and do. And so there is a portion of, hey. You need at least this number of demo ones, and then we will also comp you on demo two so long as it doesn't become, like, too large of a ratio where you're just focused on farming the net the existing accounts, and you're not actually helping me create new pipeline. So that's where we'll put some of those, guidelines, whether it's a ratio or, you know, once you get through quota, then you can go do this sort of thing. And you don't have to screen share your exact comp plan now. But if I wanted to go and implement this today in, like, a mid market or an enterprise sale, are we talking, like, 60 to 70% demo ones, 30% demo twos and closed one. Is that like, how does that how does that play out? Roughly right. Yeah. So it'll be, you know, like, a three to 175%. 25% is probably the average. Yeah. Because, again, you don't want those opportunities dying on the vine. So but we still need to have, like, an outlook on the future where if we're just focused on what are we gonna close this quarter, how we move it forward, we're gonna make a world of hurt next quarter. So that's the pipe gen stuff. So you're getting, like, more bigger multi threaded meetings throwing on the calendar. You talked about you implemented MEDDPIC. For those of you who aren't familiar with it, it's a forecasting methodology that is eight letters. I won't give you every single one, but it's like metrics, economic buyer, decision maker, decision criteria, etcetera. No. And it's basically, like, derisking every single part of an enterprise deal step by step. No. My guess, you didn't throw the eight letters at them and be like, great. Now go do it. You probably packaged that with, like, command of the message or, like, some, like, more enterprise y discovery framework. What did that look like? Yeah. Exactly. I mean, you hit you hit it on the head, and sort of the exact ones. I think, you know, we did, we did start slower. Like, for us, the ice the ICE were sort of the most important ones to get it into the pipeline. Like, if you can identify a pain, you can find a champion. Right? And then you know ultimately who the economic buyer is, that's a good fit. It's a good opportunity. It should be in the pipeline. And then the other stuff, we'll we'll get better on, and that's where we started to coach on. Right? Understanding the decision criteria and the decision process and which metrics to look for and then how to tie those back to the pain. Right? So that is ultimately what we did. We started out with this sort of, like, slower approach. And when we talk about the pipeline generation, that ICE is what we worked with the SDR team to understand as well. Hey. It's gotta be at least this level to set the meeting for me. And if we don't have I c or e, it's not gonna go into the pipeline. It's not a bad meeting. It's just not ready yet. Oh, he'll still let them set the meeting, but do they create the opportunity or opportunity isn't created, or is it created and just not qualified? That's, so this this is one of those that goes back and it's gotten Yeah. Yeah. I feel you. And so, like, because because of our rules of engagement and our road rules, like in the old world, it would have been created right away so that the rep can maintain ownership of it. As, you know, we've made a push up market and the mid market and the enterprise, and we and I talked about prioritization earlier. With that prioritization exercise came a level of, hey. These are your named accounts, and it's gonna stay in your name. Definitely easier to do upmarket than downmarket. And so that is where we said, like, hey. You don't have to create the op, but you're gonna maintain ownership. And so that's where they'll go back with the STR. Now it is at a point where if it doesn't have those ICE criteria, it's a good fit meeting, but it's not a created opportunity yet. I'm a believer get your best conversators in the conversation as fast as possible. And it's very rare that a SDR is a better conversationalist around your product and the value of the problems than an SDR. Now that, of course, there's exceptions. Right? Yep. I would be nervous about my SDRs doing ICE on a cold call to book a meeting for an AE. So how does that happen after they book the meeting? Help me explain the machinations of doing ICE as an SDR, but not blowing it because I'm not yet really, like, on the AE level to have those conversations. Yeah. You're right. That is that is on the, that is on the account executive in that first meeting. You know, the STR is looking for a specific persona. So for us, you know, they're in sales, they're in marketing, they're in rev ops. Right? Those are, like, our three sort of key personas. They've gotta be at least director plus. And so if you can go and get those things obviously, if they're taking a meeting, you would you would think we're we're all sort of pretty busy, that there is some they've identified some level of pain and fit on that sort of first cold call. And then from there, the account executive is on that first call sort of identifying those things. Like, can this person get a sales cycle started, and are they willing to champion it throughout? And then, you know, the rep, from there is taking the notes that the SDR had, identifying pain, pretty simple. We're, again, in a lucky space where we can identify pretty quickly. And then just getting an understanding of, like, hey. Is it gonna be you that would sign off on something like this? You know, is there somebody else we have to get involved? And they'll usually say, like, no. We gotta get a few other people involved. Ultimately, Ted's gonna be the DM on this, and and then that'll be enough to create the opportunity. Do you manage your AEs similarly in their own self pipe creation, or is are they not are they not self prospecting? They are self prospecting. It is a motion. I think what you see more now, is, like, a level of self prospecting. So they they do have a, a component of that. We do measure that sort of back to, like, that daily pacing of what are we looking at. We are looking at, total pipe created in the day, but also, how much of that was self sourced across AEs and and the managers, directors, VPs. They have a line of sight onto what that mix should be in a day. So, yeah, we we do it that way as as well. If it's upmarket and it's a named account, they don't have to create the opportunity right away. If it's an SMB and they're self sourcing, which there's a good chunk of them that do that, then they will create that opportunity, right away. Again, much smaller organization. We don't hold them to the same you know, has to have that strict entry criteria. It can really just be like, is it a good fit for our service? Is it the right title? And then it's ultimately on you to find a pain and sell them on the value. I've got one last question on Steven Ice first meeting. Alright. So, one, I just love how you explain. Because a lot of times people roll out MEDDPIC, and it's like, AE's are their heads are spinning trying to get, like, decision maker, decision criteria, metrics, champ like, competition all in the first meeting. Yeah. Yeah. And identified pain, champion, economic buyer are three things. Like, knowing who that person is are three things that you should be able to get. In a first call, you might not have quantified metrics on that pain, but you can usually get identified pain, champion, economic buyer. So that's what I need to get. You probably did some things teaching them how to get it that were, like, changes in how your team was doing discovery before. Were there any, like, notable changes in your discovery methodology that you use to enable the team so that they could get bigger pains, that they could get champions, that they could get economic buyers? I mean, and I I don't want this to sound like a product pitch, but we we did start to, like, with, you know, with AI and with our Copilot system, we we definitely started to rely on that intelligence that whether it's ZoomInfo provided or, frankly, we're generating through our own interactions, you know, because we're recording calls and capturing emails. So there was a big emphasis sort of going into that call of, like, hey. Joining a call at this company. Catch me up on the prior interactions. I mean, like, why haven't they purchased from us? And and then we start to get, like, a viewpoint. We're relying on intent, and we're looking at signals across the organization to come with a point of view to that conversation so that you can either affirm it or say, like, hey. I appreciate you did your homework, but, no, we're actually doing x, y, and z. We're focused on a, b, and c. And then that led to, like, a much more sort of open conversation for us to start to, pick away at some of those versus like, an interrogation of what are you struggling with today? Do you buy, or who's the one that signs off on this? Because if it's not you, like, connect me with them. What keeps you up at night? Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. Alright, Steven. Amazing show. We have to move to the final question. And the final question is this. We talked about a lot of good habits specifically related to going up market that a lot of sales leaders can do to support their teams. But what is one bad habit that keeps you in $2 pizza slice special day for the rest of your life? In other words, what is one bad habit that every team needs to break if they wanna close bigger deals today? Like, I think it's, for me and where I've coached the team a lot on because we went from from them, a good chunk of them being so largely transactional to now upmarket focused is they felt the need to talk pricing and packaging way too early. And so, like, just stop doing that. It's okay. Enterprise buyers, they get it. I get it as well. They're gonna ask you the question, but it's totally okay to tell, you know, your customer, hey. We're just not there yet, like, range of options, and, you know, we're not sure what the best solution is for you quite yet. And you don't have enough of a handle on what we do to understand where you wanna prioritize things. And so that was, I think, one of the biggest pieces of in one call to your point earlier, they tried to go, like, discovery, super brief demo to show them something, and then felt the need to, like, talk pricing with somebody that ultimately can't give you a yes or a no. And so need to be discussing price yet. Dude, amazing show. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Mark. It's time for a three step recap and one thing you can do. So three step recap, three steps to closing bigger deals as a sales organization. Number one, you wanna look at win rates by time horizon and average contract size. So, for example, if your enterprise team is winning a bunch of create and close in month deals, you might be closing and creating $5,000,000 deals in month, but you are probably not. And so your SMB segment should be really high in t zero deals, deals that are created and closed in month. But your enterprise segment should honestly be slowing some of those deals down to bring your ACP up so that you can actually build a bigger case. That's number one. Number two, you wanna make sure that you get pipeline for bigger deals. So the two major changes that Steven made were, number one, he changed the SDR comp plan. So it was 75% focused on demo ones, those first meetings, and then 25% focused on demo twos or even close one revenue. And then the other change that he made was he worked with his marketing team not to just run, like, mass paid ads for SMB deals, but to run, like, ABM campaigns, events, dinners, sponsor thirty minutes to president's club to get in front of all these sales leaders. That was number two. And lastly, number three, when training his AEs to close bigger deals, he started with ICE, identify pain, find a champion, an economic buyer in the first meeting, and that's the key to driving a bigger deal in later meetings. Alright, Mark. What's one thing people can do? I think if I was someone listening to this podcast, what I would do is find a way to slice your win rates a bit differently. Rather than just a combined win rate, maybe you do industry, maybe you do cycle time like, Steven is, maybe you do deal size. But what I would recommend is find one area that is important to your business, some change that you wanna drive, cut your win rates by that, and then even think about doing your deal size and your cycle time by that same cut. I guarantee you'll find something interesting. Well, folks, if you like this one, Mark and I did a metrics playbook the other day. We'll put a link to that podcast in the show notes. It is a beginning to end on every metric you would need to know as a sales leader. And if you like that one, let us know, and we'll see you on the next one. Peace.
