## Transcript

Good morning everybody and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes of President's Club. My name is Armand Farouk. I'm here with my co host Nick Sadowski. And today, we have the legend Josh Braun, the man on LinkedIn, the guy who has the crispy value props, and he's the head of his own consulting business. Nick, why should people listen? This is one of the best episodes we've had around objection handling. So if you wanna get better at handling objections, you're in for a treat. Three, two, one. Handle this episode. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Josh. Welcome to the show. You know we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Actionable takeaway number one is that nobody cares about your product because your product is worthless without problems that prospects can relate to. So step number one, if I'm coming in and being an SDR, I got to really understand at a crisp specific level what the before version of the infomercial is in your prospect's words, not yours. Very nice. What's number two, Josh? Prospecting tip number two is that there is a natural reflux reaction when you pick up the phone and make a cold call to avoid salespeople. So if you're sounding like this, hello, my name is Matt and I'm calling with Acme. You're gonna set off that negative reflex reaction. So you have to do something a little different, and here's my favorite opening line. Hey. Hey, Matt. This is Josh. You're you're probably gonna hate me because this is a cold call. Would you like to hang up and fire me right now? Or can I steal a minute? That's called an accusation audit term coined by Chris Voss of never split the difference fame. And what it does is it labels the negative emotion that the other person is feeling. And when you label negatives, you diffuse negatives, whether you use something like you're gonna hate this call or I know you weren't expecting this same idea is to label what they're the negative feeling they're thinking to diffuse it. Nice. What's the last one, Josh? Round us out. Last one is stop trying to change people's minds. It's a net negative every single time. Not once have I gotten to a objection with someone where I tried to change their mind and where they said, Hey, You're right. I changed my mind. Just doesn't happen. So instead of trying to overcome objections, learn how to understand objections. So Josh, can you walk us through if I get one more accelerate, optimize your lead development process by increasing by 13% email, I'm gonna jump out a window. Right? And so you talk about this crispy thing. Could you give me an example of how you can make a problem or the before state of the infomercial sound really, really crispy. Yeah. So let's go through a non example and an example so you can see what it sounds like in an email. So I'll read one out loud to you. Let's pretend you edit podcasts because you're a podcast host, which you guys do. So I have to have a hypothesis of what problem might you be bumping into that you might be not even maybe aware of because you're just getting the job done today the best way that you know how. One of the things that you might do is spend a lot of time editing podcasts. You gotta remove umms and ahs. You gotta edit stuff. People like me say something wrong or I curse and you don't wanna curse with someone. It's a lot of work. Gotta create show notes. Probably takes a bunch of time. So if you had a service that allowed you to be able to get podcast publishable ready episodes with show notes without you having to do all that work, you just literally upload it in twenty four hours, you get it back and it's perfect, it's polished. That's a good hypothesis. That's a good before and after. So once we know that, and we have to know that, we could then write an email. So here's what a bad email sounds like. We help you optimize your podcast with our 360 degree platform. We've worked with podcast hosts like a b and c. And here's what it sounds like to lead with a problem. What podcast host is editing, stuff like removing umms and ahs, taking out curse words, IQ three tagging for iTunes. Immediately when you read something like that, the brain automatically goes to, oh my god. That's my world. What's the next sentence say? Because when you articulate problems like that, the brain wants to know, what do you have for me? The only way to get that information is to talk to customers that used your service and understand how they're describing the terrible, no good, very bad things that were going on that caused them to start considering switching and ultimately switching. So could you give us an example of, like, now we have a sense of, hey, we've gotten these crispy value props. How are you actually gonna weave that into a call script or a cold email? So the first thing I'm gonna try to do is find something about the prospect that I can use to lead off my email with. That's about them because that's their favorite topic. And the reason this is important and you can't always find it is that when you see an email, you're gonna see the name, subject line and the first 135 characters. Can't do anything about your name. You're a stranger. That's automatically gonna be a problem. There's ways around that actually too, which we can talk about. Second thing is a good subject line. And the third thing, which is also important that a lot of people don't talk about is that first sentence, first like 130 characters. And everybody's favorite topic is themselves. So if you're reaching out to me and you're this podcast editing service, might sound something like this. Josh, just been inhaling your Inside Selling Podcast. One episode that really resonated with me was your interview with Jackie Lipnicki and how she's able to quickly look at LinkedIn profiles to better personalize your cold call scripts within less than ten seconds. Like, that's gonna get my attention really fast, and then I'm gonna transition. Have no idea if this is something you're bumping into, but a lot of podcast hosts hate editing. Stuff like removing umms and ahs and removing curse words. That's the second sentence. Third sentence is, are you against learning how other podcast hosts are eliminating this completely and getting publishable, polished show notes and podcasts back in less than twenty four hours. Either way, keep up the great work on the podcast. I'm loving it. Okay. So that call to action we got to talk about because that's really different than what I'm seeing a lot of reps send which is, how's Thursday at three for us to speak? What are you doing there? Yeah. So Chris Voss again of, Never Split the Difference talks about this and so so does Jim Camp. And the problem is if you're walking in a mall and you see a mall kiosk person and they say, can I ask you a question? You know that if you say yes, you're about three minutes away from being sold some sea scrub you don't want. It's the same thing in sales. We're sort of yes addicted as salespeople and as prospects we feel like we're being led into a yes trap. Like if I say yes to this, what am I agreeing to? So we're weary of yes. No feels safer. So would you be opposed? Would this be a terrible idea? Would it be a ridiculous idea? Would you be against? That phraseology and that language, it's much more disarming because it feels safer psychologically than saying yes because salespeople are always trying to get prospects to say yes. I love that it's a horrible idea because it kind of plays into like the I really like the self deprecating humor and authenticity where like I might propose something to a customer and be like, look, I've been wrong before about where we're supposed to go with these. Would it be a horrible idea for us to do this next? And so I'm combining the, like, self deprecating with the inverse ask that you're doing. We also use that same technique with objections. Right? So after someone voices an objection, I'm already using a vendor for that. It's a very common objection on a cold call. There's ways to proactively prevent that actually. We could talk about that as well, but someone says, you know, I'm already using a vendor for that. Your inclination might be to try to change their mind and tell them, well, I'm not asking to buy anything right now. But using this technique, you could do the same thing. You could say another vendor, it's called mirroring. They go, yeah, we're using X, Y, and Z. And you might then say, it sounds like you're really happy with them. That's called a label. You're labeling what they're probably thinking. What's interesting when you do that one is people will usually say, yeah, but, you know, here's some stuff and then you can say, you know, sounds like you're all set but would it be a terrible idea to see if there are opportunities, options beyond what you have now for lowering your property taxes and insurance premiums? Not for now, but just so you could see what's out there. And after you've mirrored and labeled and phrased it and you've taken away the pressure of now, what I'm doing is I'm taking away the pressure of now because generally speaking, when you reach out outbound, nobody's in buy mode. They're not actively shopping. And so when you just say just to start the conversation, just so you could see what your options are, not for now, but use the word for the future, it just diffuses and starts so many more conversations because there's not the pressure expectation. The other thing that you talked about earlier is you're never trying to change minds. Right? And so you're going with me. You're basically saying, like, yeah. That that's actually why I reached out is, like, we're on the same page. I'm in the exact right place. Are there any other examples of, like, when you get objections, like, you're not going against the grain, you're actually getting on the customer side? With objections, the first thing to really understand, step number one is to understand that objections are either true or not true. Sometimes a prospect will object and you'll think, Oh, that's the real objection, when in fact it's not. I'll give you a great example of one that comes up all the time. Prospect says, this sounds great. Can you send me a proposal? And most of the time when salespeople hear that, they're like beaming. Oh my God, dude. I'm gonna close this sale. Absolutely, man. I'll send it off right to you. Have it you'll have it in twenty four hours. And then guess what happens a lot of times? Nothing. And that's because that really wasn't what they wanted. That really wasn't the they were just saying that because they don't know a way to get off the phone. They don't know how to be the bearer of bad news. So we'll just role play this on what a better approach can be, and we can apply this to pretty much every objection. But you go ahead and ask me, Juan, say say, hey, Josh. Sounds great. Can you send me a proposal? Alright Josh this sounds interesting could you send me some information or put an email together for me? What information would be most helpful? Well you know just a general overview of your services, rates and what this thing might cost and then I'll think it over. Think it over? Yeah. I mean I you you literally just you know we had one call, I can't make a decision about this today. Sounds like you're not really sure if you want to bring me on. Well this is our first call and you're asking me to make a big commitment and yeah I'm not totally comfortable making a commitment to you right now Josh, I guess that's what it is. Would it be a terrible idea if you discuss this internally to see if the investment and what I'm delivering is even something that's a priority for you right now before I flood your inbox with proposal. Yeah. I mean, I think I'm probably gonna go back and talk with, with Arman, my COO. And I mean, we need to even figure out if we need need what you're offering before I even would look at your thing. So, yeah, that's probably the way we should go about it. Yeah. You've got, like, people like John Burrows, Richard Harris. You've got winning by design. I'm curious. What would prompt you to wanna hire a former kindergarten teacher of all things? Well, truthfully, I mean, those guys are great and we talk with some of them, but I feel like, you know, John's really prospecting heavy and Richard does a great job with discovery. And, you know, you our team's really struggling with objection handling more than anything, and that's where I see you fitting in more than anybody else. So I wanna go I'll go I'll role play for a second and notice what I'm doing here. I'm having you give me my value proposition because you're zeroing in on objection handling, and I could have talked about prospecting or closing or all kinds of things that you're really not interested in. Right? And that's a problem. Right? So by asking that question and then this is how I'm gonna close it. What next step, if any, would you like to take? Well, let me go talk with Armand and then you can call me next week. I'll give you that. Call me a Thursday next week. Would you be against putting something on the calendar so we're not chasing ourselves and playing phone tag? That works for me. I can do Thursday. Let's play hardball here and say no I'll just get back to you. Now here's the great thing, sales is about leadership. Alright. I have to be in control of everything. So let me tell you how this plays out sometimes. Let's say they booked the meeting and they don't show up for whatever reason. Happens. What I'm gonna do is literally send one one sentence email and never follow-up again for three months. And the reason for that is this, if there's no motivation or desire, no amount of follow-up emails is gonna change your mind. I've been trying to get my wife to clean out her closet for a year. I've been using every sales tactic in the book until I realized there's no motivation or desire. What you know is if people aren't holding up their commitments, their actions are showing you that there's no motivation or desire, which is okay because the idea behind this technique is not to move the sale forward. The technique is get to the truth, and the truth is only one of two things. Either the prospect is motivated to wanna continue the conversation with us or they're not, and I get to control that, not you. Have you given up on helping your reps diffuse objections? Now, one of two things is gonna happen when you submit. And I gotta tell you, and I just had this happen today with a very big company. I just sent this out and I got an email back and I wanna say less than two minutes of, oh my God, please don't go away, hair on fire problems, we're gonna get back and name some times, right? The psychology behind it is people don't like to feel like quitters. And here's the best part about the technique. Either way, you're good because if they don't respond, there's nothing there anyway. Phenomenal. I can spend my time starting more conversations and finding people that are motivated to continue, or they are and they respond back. But in no situation am I sending nine emails and worrying about it. It's done. So that philosophy has changed my performance as an individual contributor. I focus on two things now, prospecting like a machine and getting to the truth. Because I'm doing what you're saying here. Prospect like crazy. I've got a great pipeline, and now I feel comfortable. Look. If this isn't something they wanna pursue, great. Fine. That's fine. And now I'm only working the deals that are the deals people are actually motivated. And all that free time that I'm not spending sending eight follow-up emails to Josh because he's ghosting me, I'm spending bringing in new conversations. It's literally changed my performance as a rep. I know I'm gonna lose this thought, so I have to ask you. It's going all the way back to this cold email thing of this email that you're sending. And I wish I had a cool, unique, memorable name like Armand, but I don't. It's Nick, and it probably blends in with all these other names. And so I can't do anything about my name short of changing it. But you said there's something we could do to change our name or make this work. So I'm really curious about this because I have a name that blends in sometimes. Let me give you the psychology first and then we'll go into it because I'm big on psychology so you understand the why. So you can make the words your own. So I don't know, three weeks ago, my wife and I were in Boulder at a Japanese restaurant. She always orders a glass of wine, always. And she drinks that glass of wine and very rarely does she order a second glass, hardly ever. But when the waiter comes over and says, would you like a second class? She always says, sure. And she gets second class, pretty much always. I had this happen to me once at an airport. I was getting a granola bar and there was a refrigerator next to the checkout stand, next to the register. And the lady working in the register said, would you like a bottle of water with that? And I said, hey. I'm just curious. Were you kind of coached and trained on to ask that question? She goes, yes. You have to ask it. I'm really sorry if you don't want a water. I'm like, I'll take one. Then what I did is I sat and I observed what the take rate was on that ask. And it was about 35, 40%. The problem is we don't ever ask. Like when we sell products to someone that's been using our products for two or three months, we rarely reach back out on a consistent, I'm going to use that word a lot, consistent basis and say, Hey, do you know we also do this? I mean, there's a reason why McDonald's says, Would you like fries with that? Because it works, right? And so how do we apply this to this technique? Well, imagine that you reach out to five customers a week, three customers a week, every week. This technique takes about two minutes. And you say this, I know this is probably a huge imposition. Here's that accusation on us again. But I'm just wondering if you have any other titles, titles, titles in your network that might be able to benefit from value prop. If you do, I'll give you the copy you can paste into an email so you don't have to do any work. And so do you do anything from a copy standpoint when you're getting a referral to make sure like that it sounds like it's coming from them and not from you? Yeah. So what I do is again, I label it. Hey. Josh told me to paste this in. Like, I that's what's in the copy. I love this. Here's the thing, dude. It's just about being real with people. Send me some information. It's the same kind of thing where you just say to somebody, can I ask you a really awkward question right now? Sure. A lot of times when people ask me to send them information, it's just a nice way of saying, Hey, old Jewish guy with a receding hairline. I'm really not interested right now. Would you like to fire me right now? It's totally okay. I've been fired like five times this week. I mean, the last thing you probably want in your inbox is more information from me. Lord knows you got enough emails. And what you typically hear when you ask that is, you know what? You're right, dude. This really isn't a priority. I was really not gonna ever read your message. I just didn't know what to say. Right? So what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to create an environment where people feel comfortable that I'm not gonna pressure. That's my whole technique. It's just that it's it's trying to help people, like, is to lean back. It's just lean back a little bit. So same idea. So where do you draw the line between I'm gonna invite all of the rejections and, like, okay, when somebody says it's actually not a priority, turning that back around and trying to actually address why it's not a priority. Like, where do you find that line? You don't. You don't assume that even though you have a value proposition, it's valuable to them at that time. For example, I have a TV in my back bedroom, it's missing a pixel. It's a problem, but I rarely watch that TV and when I do, I don't really notice the pixel all that much. So the problem isn't intense and frequent. And so given my limited resources, which I have and so do you and so do your prospects, it's not really high up on my list right now. Maybe if a few more pixels go out and my wife turns it into a more of a family room, it changes. But nothing that you say is gonna convince me to make that a priority. So if someone says this isn't a priority right now, our inclination is to, what can I say to make it a priority? Or let me ask them about their priorities as if they're gonna give that up to you because they know, like, where you're going with it. So I'm saying like accept sometimes the truth and truths always have oomph, meaning reasons and explanations. So if someone says, dude, this isn't a priority right now, I got like three TVs that are working perfectly. We live in a four bedroom house. I never watch that TV. It's just not on our radar right now. What a salesperson is gonna try to do is say, how can I make the back bedroom TV a priority? Rather than doing what Nick said earlier, which is brilliant, which is, this looks like it's not a fit at this time. I'm gonna bail out, and I'm gonna go find someone else that maybe has a TV with more pixels out. So, Josh, one of the things that I have had to balance is one of the things you talked about earlier is the prospect is getting the job done today. And sometimes when I call somebody and we're in especially in the beginning of the sales process, you get that reactance of I don't want to be sold, or they need your help illuminating that there is indeed a problem. And so I'm really curious about the balance because I'm all for pushing them out. Like, if you you're not motivated, don't wanna do this. But there are times that you need to illuminate it. And so you do some interesting things with this, I think. Yeah. So several years ago, my wife and I were in a mall, and she dragged me in there. And I didn't need anything, literally. I just killed him some time. We split up and said, hey, we'll meet here at the fountain in forty minutes. And I was just walking around. There was a fit to run store and I just sort of walked in there. So if the store associates said, what brings you in today? I would have said nothing. If she said, can I help you? I would say no. If she said, do you have any problems? Typically people come in here because they have problem, problem, problem. I'd say, I don't have any of those. But this sales associate didn't do any of those things. She looked down at my sneakers and she said, Oh, are you a runner? And I said, Yes. And she said, What distance? And I said, Oh, I'm training for my first marathon. And then she asked a really smart question. She said, have you ever had your running gait checked? And I said, what's that? And moments later, I'm literally, and I have video of this and pictures of this, I'm on a treadmill. And she shows me a freeze frame of the video and shows me that my feet are pronating. And then she asks a question. She said, Hey, Josh, are you aware that if you run-in sneakers that are not made for pronated feet, you can get injured on long distance runs? And if you'd like, we can take a look at your sneakers to see if they're made for pronated feet. And they weren't. And I spent $180 on sneakers and insoles and God knows what else because as an old Jewish man, the last thing I wanna is get injured on long distance runs. Right? All right, Josh. So we talked about our crispy value props, we talked about using all of these pseudo Jedi mind tricks and mirroring and labeling to not try to convince people to change their minds. We haven't talked about some of the bad habits. And so if there is one bad habit that every rep had to break today to be better, what would it be? Stop assuming that everybody wants to drop what they're doing for you and start thinking about it a little bit differently. That your purpose is to see if someone's open to how you could potentially help them kick more. And the answer to that is one of two things. Yes, they are open to sharing a bit more and continuing the conversation or no, they're not at this time and so detach from the outcome. Alright folks, before we jump off, Josh, do you want to plug anything with the audience? Sure. Joshbraun.com/badass is a guide of all my favorite sales plays for starting conversations with prospects but without them feeling sold or manipulated. Joshbraun.com/badass. Awesome. And if you guys haven't already followed Josh, please make sure you follow him on LinkedIn. He posts some amazing stuff. And everybody hang on for a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode include, number one, detach from the outcome. Stop trying to convince people to change their minds and just focus on finding the truth. Number two, use an accusation audit very frequently. It sounds something like, would it be ridiculous if blank? Number three, use have you given up on blank as your one sentence breakup email, and stop following up 300 times afterwards. And then number four, when you get an objection, mirror it. Say the last three words of the objection with an uptone, and then label it with it sounds like blank. Nick, how can people help us out? Well, Josh is gonna be a little upset with me, but I can't detach from the outcome of our show ratings on iTunes. We've got five stars, and I'm very insistent upon it staying that way. But I want more reviews. So if you haven't gone and reviewed the show, please go on to iTunes, give us five stars, write a little blurb about how you love the show, and we'll see you all next week on thirty minutes to President's Club.
