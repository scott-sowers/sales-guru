## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the one and only Parker, the SDR manager over at Gong. Nick, why should people listen? If you gotta make cold calls and send cold emails to book meetings, you probably wanna listen to Parker. He's got some really interesting strategies around creating your own marketing qualified leads by teeing up emails and stack ranking your cold calls by opens. It's really interesting. So give it a listen. Three, two, one. Free leads. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early, so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright. Parker, welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Yeah. Thanks for having me. Alright. So top three are gonna be how to handle email objections like a pro and turn an email opens into demos. What I mean by this is when you're an SDR, you're gonna have the urge when somebody responds via email with an objection, like you're gonna get every day, you're gonna wanna craft some crazy response to try to get a demo. We're gonna go over today how to handle those like a pro and how to turn them into demos. Second takeaway is gonna be understanding objections before trying to handle them. What we see often is it's always a race. Right? We always wanna get the demo in three minutes, and we always wanna, you know, quickly handle the objection and move on. The problem that we see with that is we don't fully understand the objection, so we're not correctly handling it. Therefore, we're never getting over the objection, and when we're trying to close, we still never overcame their original objection. We're gonna go over how you can quickly but efficiently be able to, you know, correctly overcome people's objections on cold calls. Last piece is gonna be making the calls relevant to your prospects. All they care about is what's in it for them, what is your offering going to do for them specifically. I get cold called all the time. We're on the phone for four or five minutes. I still don't know what's in it for me. What does your product do for me? I don't care what it does or how it works. All I wanna know is the value that's in it for me. We're gonna go over how you can quickly do that on the front half of your calls. Parker, you talked about, like, quickly handling stuff and quickly getting to the demo. Can you talk a little bit more about, like, that and what we should be doing instead? Yeah. Definitely. So, you know, let's say somebody hits you with an objection of right? Like, I I'm just trying to think of of one off the top of my head. Like, you know We looked at call intelligence software in the past, Parker, and it just seems like a lot of work to set up. Okay. Yeah. Definitely. So I'd wanna understand more about when you did look at Call Intelligence and you say at least said, like, it took a lot of time to set up. Like, I I don't wanna assume that, like, I, you know, I I don't know. Like, did did you implement software? Like, what like, how far did you get? Like, that's I feel like it's so open ended. Right? It really could have been anything. So I probably wanna get to, like, okay. That's really interesting. Like, try to help me understand you're so, like you actually went in and and tried to set up, like, some sort of conversational intelligence. Like, was it, like, an actual product? Was it something you built in house? Right? Like, I I wanna learn more. I love what you're doing there, Parker, because I feel like the temptation for a salesperson is to be like, no. Well, Gong is so easy to set up. Let me tell you about how easy it is to set up. And we had a guest on the show a couple weeks ago, and one of the things he said stuck with me. He said, trade your cleverness for bewilderment. And the idea is there's the temptation to when you hear an objection, it's like, I know how to answer that. But you're right. You have to seek first to understand before being understood. Because to your point, if they built something in house, addressing that objection is gonna be very different than if they, like, I don't know, did a trial of Gong at their last company, but maybe they didn't even log in once. So you're right. You need to understand those things. So I feel like we we can jump back a couple paces to, like, before you even get to the objection, you're making cold calls, and you lead a team of people who are making cold calls and prospecting. Can you talk me through some of the best practices that you share with your SDR team when it comes to, like, making cold calls? Yeah. Definitely. So prep is gonna be key. And what I always tell everyone to do is prep the day before. So I don't wanna come in on a Tuesday with no call tasks, no call research done. I'm scrambling in the morning during, like, prime time calling hours to build this list, to build the the research, and then I finally start calling. Every day before I, you know, clock off for the day per se. Yeah. Let let's say I wanna be done working at five. At 4PM, I'm building my next day to make sure that, hey. If I gotta do 60 calls tomorrow, like, I have 60 call tasks ready to go, and I already have some sort of, like, three by three research to be able to, you know, get on the phone, quickly make it relevant to them, but but add a little bit of personalization. Because they're getting cold called right and left, especially, like, we're calling into sales leaders. Like, we gotta sound a little bit different than everyone else to, like, break through that noise. Because, like, as big of a brand, like, Dong is, like, not everyone knows what it is or or cares what it is. Right? So we have to, like, really have a good icebreaker and really quickly make it relevant and get them excited, within the first thirty seconds or, you know, the call really goes downhill from there. And what do you do when people turn on the sales pitch and they're like, ah, no. Like, I know they're trying to help me make more money. Everyone wants to help me make more money. And they just, like, put up the guards and they say, like, Parker, this is great, but I'm not interested. How do you start to break that down or disarm that? Yeah. Absolutely. So I think how we do it with Gong, right, is like, Arma, can I level with you real quick? This is cold call. I'm a I'm an SDR over here at Gong. I'm I'm just making some cold calls. Hey. I understand that I just called you out of the blue, and and I'm probably telling you what everyone else is telling you. Right? We're gonna make you more money. We're gonna get you more conversations. Can I just tell you why Gong is different than literally every other technology out there and why it's relevant to you? Because I've done a ton of research on your company. You've grown by 250% in the last year. You guys are hiring SDRs and AEs, and it looks like you guys just raised a huge round of funding. Like, to me, those are huge signals that you guys need Gong or at least need to start exploring some sort of revenue intelligence tool? So my favorite way to handle not interested is exactly how you're describing it. First thing you're doing is you're literally just calling out exactly what went through their mind in those first thirty seconds. You're saying like, hey. You probably think I'm like every single other person who's calling you trying to save you money or make you money. And they're like, you're sorta right. And then you acknowledge that you're making cold calls. And then the last thing you're doing is you're making them feel like you you've built a little bit of goodwill by throwing your research out there so that they're like, okay. I feel bad that this person spent three minutes or five minutes getting to know me as a person and or a company. And then now what I'm gonna do is hang up on them immediately. What you're totally doing is disarming the objection and turning yourself into a human being. Do I have that approach right? Absolutely. Yeah. A 100%. It's like that accusation audit, but also to like yeah. Just letting them know, like, hey. I'm I'm an SDR. Like, I'm I'm grinding out over here making a ton of cold calls. And and I'm trying to be the best that I can be, but, you know, obviously, I missed the mark a little bit at the beginning. Parker, one of the things you talked about earlier in the research side of things was this three by three rule. Can you tell me what that is? Yes. I'm giving you three minutes to go and find three quick relevant pieces of information. It doesn't even have to be anything crazy. Like, the last thing I wanna do is, like, read off, like, hey, Armand. I saw you over at, you know, x y z company, and I I saw you've been the director of business development for three years. Like, that's to me, that's boring. Right? But what I wanna see is, like, you're hiring. You've had growth. Like, LinkedIn's telling me you've had huge growth. Like, just saw you hired a CRO. Just saw you got this big round of funding. Like, just saw you launch this big product. Like, something that took a little bit of effort to find, but also, like, you weren't digging for hours looking for this, you know, piece of information. So that gets back to, like, our account tiering. Right? So, like, my tier ones are, like, my top accounts are gonna be having those, like, buying signals of Gong, where they're hiring. They got funding. Like, you know, they have a a big sales team that kind of look similar to ours, where they have AEs, SDRs. They have, you know, maybe a CRO or VP of sales. Another thing I look for is, like, a request demo button, on their website. Right? Because to me, that tells me, like, hey. They're demoing some sort of platform via web conferencing. Now it's relevant for Gong to be able to help. And then also too, they have an SDR team that's using some sort of a dialer so we can actually capture those conversations. So not only am I, like, qualifying the tech stack by looking at some of this stuff, but it's also showing me that, like, wow. This is a really big top account, and we have a ton of customers just like them. So if we take one of those examples, let's call it the request a demo button. I think most people have a request a demo button. How would you turn that initial trigger into either a value prop or a phone opener or even possibly email copy so so that you throw that right in front at the beginning. Yeah. Definitely. So I probably just rely back to how we're using it internally. Right? So you request a demo. Boom. It goes over to an SDR. It books time for the SDR. The SDR is gonna do a call. I think with every single company, it's making sure they have that initial call call with the SDR down. Right? Qualification's good. We're doing good discovery and, like, trying to get that consistent across their entire SDR team. But also too, like, having visibility for the AE to be able to see that qual or that discovery call, right, to get them prepped for that next demo call they're gonna have with the prospect. So making that hand off, like, seamless to the AE side. Parker, you put something in the prep doc about treating email opens like MQLs, and I'm wondering if you can talk about that strategy a little bit. Yeah. So every SDR has has made the case of, like, hey. I'm not getting enough MQLs, for marketing. Right? And so my pushback on that is like, okay. Well, why don't you create your own? Right? Like, aside from people coming inbound from, like, events, webinars, or maybe a demo request, A lot of it is just them interacting with your content and, you know, meeting a certain threshold where they're now counting as an MQL. We can do the same thing with emails. So what I would do every day before, I I would make sure I had my call task for the next day. But I'd also schedule, you know, a good 60 to a 100 emails, really targeted list with some really good email content. Some of it would be personalized if it was like a top account. Others would just be more templated. And I would have those go out at 8AM. And what I would do was when I started dialing at, like, 08:15, 08:30, what I would do is I would call everyone that replied, opened my email, clicked on my email, interacted with it in any way. Like, those are the people I would call first. And to me, that's telling me either have your phone in your hand or you're sitting in front of your computer. And they would answer. We'd be able to have a conversation about the email that I sent them as kind of a three by three. Right? And then, you know, we'd go into the conversation from there. So you're literally sending all of your emails at one point in time so that you can quickly look at of your 60 emails, which 10 got opened, and you're prioritizing those dials as your doblets in the morning. Yep. Absolutely. You talked about leveling with your prospects during your cold calls. And I think you've done a couple things where you're basically calling out the fact that you're a sales leader and I'm a sales rep. Like, give me a shot, dude. Are there other times where you're sort of trying to take the prospect out of, like, defensive mode by just calling that out? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. All of the time. I think, like, the more I can humanize the conversation and the more I can make them feel like, I don't want to say like bad for me, but like, remember like when they were a sales rep back in the day. Right? So I think, you know, sometimes people will tell me like, I'm just not interested. Like, I gotta go. And it's like, Hey, can I level with you real quick? Like, I obviously missed the mark somewhere on my pitch because I've called like 10 sales leaders today and you're the first person to tell me I'm not interested. And like, I must've, I must've totally butchered this pitch. Like, do you mind if I just start over? Right? Or or or can I can I try again? Like, what would I have to do or say or what value would I have to show you to to be able to change your mind? Right? Because, obviously, like, what I'm saying is not relevant to you. One of the most memorable meetings I ever booked like, I cold call law firms, and sometimes the name of law firms sort of looks like a person's name. And so I called the managing partner of this huge law firm in New York City. And the guy, like, picks up the phone and he's super gruff, and I address him not by his name, but by the name of his law firm. And then I realized it. I was like, well, I just completely butchered that, and I I called you the name of your law firm. I know your name is Armand Farouk. Can I get ten seconds just to redo my pitch? And the guy's cracking up. And I ended up booking a meeting with the guy. And so every time we met after that, he made a joke about how I was an idiot, but it ended up working out. So, yeah, I mean, the second that you, like, take the sales hat off and you admit that you're you're not infallible, like, I feel like things go a lot better. Parker, one of the things you talked about earlier was, like, the queuing up of the emails and that first hour you're spending cold calling. And I have to imagine that you're teaching your team about, like, best practices around the daily schedule because it can be really easy to go down the rabbit holes as an SDR. Can you talk me through, like, what an optimal SDR daily schedule looks like? Yeah. Definitely. So what I like to do is schedule around when you're seeing your prospects answering the phone, whether it's based on your data, your team's data, or the org's data. But I always like to have at least three call blocks, three hours of calling throughout the day. So I like to do something early in the morning, like an eight to nine. Right? Then I'll probably do a ten to eleven, and then I'll probably finish it up with either, like, a one to two, two to three, or maybe even a three to four if I've got, like, a lot of Pacific time, to follow-up on. I really tell my SDRs, like, think of the task you're doing and, like, if that's time sensitive or is, like, a good use of your time right now. Right? Like, first thing in the morning, you know, I don't know. I don't know if I'm gonna be wanting to prospect. Right? Like, I wanna be doing that at the back half of my day because during prime working hours when people are gonna answer the phone and when I can book demos, like, I don't wanna be doing administrative work. I think now that you're remote, having structure on your calendar every day is key, but also setting goals for each thing you wanna get done during those calendar blocks. So if I have an hour call block, I'm gonna put have 25 conversations and schedule one demo or have two conversations and have one lead to next steps. Right? And I know if I did that hour and I didn't accomplish that, now I need to double down and and get up to speed on that second one and do more so that I don't continue to fall behind. Have a working buddy with some of this stuff. Right? Get on a Zoom and make cold calls with another one of your coworkers or two or three. Everyone mutes themselves, and it's just cool seeing each other's face. You can't hear each other, but at least, like, having someone there and and not being alone. Who should SDRs be calling? Because I sometimes talk to SDRs. Like, you guys are selling into the sales function for the most part, and you have all sorts of people who use Gong all the way down from, like, the SDRs and the the average individual contributors like me to the CRO. So there's a use case for everybody. Who should the SDRs actually be cold calling? Yeah. So I break it down like this. So you've got your you've got your DMs. Right? And your DMs are really just gonna be the titles that fit the qual criteria. Because at the end of the day, like, I wanna schedule meetings that are gonna flip, and they're gonna get me paid. And if I'm setting up meetings with, let's say, SDRs or AEs who can be great champions or influencers, like, it's not gonna be a qualified meeting, unfortunately. What I do is always go after, right, those DMs first. See what you can do. Like, you can never start too high, but you can always go back down. So you've gone after all the qualified titles at that account already. You've had no luck. Turn to ICs. So it's not so much like, hey. Can you go and and get me a meeting with John and, like, do my job for me? But it's more of like, hey. How well you know John? Like, how would you get a meeting with him? And I've had a lot of of luck with that. Our SDRs are like, yeah, he doesn't take cold calls at all. Like he never answers his phone, but he's really big on responding over email. But if you're going to email him, you need to make it extremely relevant and like hyper personalized or he's not going to respond. And it's like, okay, great. Like any like hot topics I should know about? Like, yeah, we're growing like crazy. And he's like pulling his hair out with onboarding. Like any case studies around how you've helped companies like ours onboard would be huge. So now I've gotten like just over like a, a ten minute LinkedIn conversation with the this SDR. I've got everything I need to type this, like, killer email to John, and John has no idea that I've been talking to his SDR and getting all this information. Well, one of the critical things I wanna point out in that story you just shared, you're not just saying like, oh, okay. I need to make it super relevant and personalized. Thanks for letting me know. Because what does that actually mean? And so when you asked, okay, well, like any any hot button topics that I should point out, Well, now you know from the inside exactly what you need to be doing as opposed to you. Like, it's amazing. Sometimes, like, when we're doing research, the best way to do research is actually to talk to a human being. Like, when I'm doing research, sometimes I really struggle to find out who the managing partner at a law firm is because it's not always public information, but that's the decision maker I need to get a hold of. And I realized instead of, like, reading, like, all sorts of weird stuff on their website and, like, trying to do search analytics on Google, I call the front desk, and I say, hey. Who's your managing partner? And they tell me. And so sometimes talking to a human being can be the fastest way to get research done. The last question that I have for you is I don't know. This might be totally irrelevant, at which case we can cut it. But you're doing a decent amount of volume. And one of the things that I find that teams who are doing high volume tend to struggle with is sometimes open rates drop. Sometimes you get, like, spam blocked and stuff like that. And so I'm curious in terms of making sure that those 100 prospects per week actually get their emails open that you actually don't get sent to the spam folder, are there any tactics for optimizing your open rate on your emails? Yeah. That's a great question. I think, one thing that I don't do is we don't put, like, any links or, like, GIFs or, like, any images. Those seem to, like, get caught by, like, spam blockers a lot and, like, dramatically decrease. So we try to add, like, just a really good personalization at the top and then, like, why it's relevant to them. And then using, you know, like, one of Gong's top, like, call to actions of, you know, setting up some sort of next steps or or maybe even leaving it open ended for them to reply to. Parker, this has been awesome. It's been a really great conversation about some best practices for SDRs. So we gotta move to the last question now. And the last question is the inverse of all the best practices we've talked about. I wanna ask you about a bad habit. My question is, what's a bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to stop doing because it's hurting them more than it's helping? Yeah. I think a bad habit that I see is it's really, really, really easy to get in like a negative slump. That that's like the biggest curse I see on salespeople, right? It's really easy to go negative and, like, everything that's going on around you. And then, like, you're just bringing that onto your cold calls. You're bringing that to your emails. Like, you're just bringing that to your outreach, and it's really not setting you up for success. Right? We gotta find some way to have that, like, glass full, glass half full attitude. Right? So taking everything in stride is like a learning lesson or like, you know, how did I grow from this? Right? But, but that's the biggest thing I see. Like, I get that it's a job. I get that things don't go your way sometimes, but like, you know, realizing like this is a business, you know, I grew from this moment. I learned from it. Like, here's how I'd approach it next time. Like spinning everything into a positive is big in sales. Because, like, there there's a lot of you face a lot of rejection. Sometimes things don't go your way. You don't close the deal you want, or you don't get the response you want, or, like, this twenty minute cold call you had doesn't turn into a demo. And it's, like, really easy to get get hard on yourself, get negative. Like, what I always like to say, like, as long as I can walk away from that deal, from that account, from that prospect, knowing that I did everything that I could to convert it and no one else could have done anything differently, like, I'm okay with that. And at the end of the day, it's their loss. Right? Because I know the value that that, you know, whatever I'm selling brings, and I knew it was a great fit. And if they don't wanna hear about it, like, that's that's totally fine. I love it. Parker, thanks for coming on. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Parker from Gong include number one, when somebody says not interested, just ask them. Can I level with you quick? Look. You're in sales. I'm in sales. Or you have sales reps. You know I'm a sales rep. Do something to call it the fact that you're making cold calls. Break the mold. Number two, three by three research. Find your top buying signals. Tier out your accounts whether they're hiring, they get just got funding, they requested a demo, and then always start with your qualified prospects and then work your way to other people who could refer you to qualified prospects. Number three, sixty email tasks locked and loaded for 8AM. After you send out those 8AM email tasks, you're gonna look at the folks who who open your emails and you're gonna dial those folks specifically. And then lastly, number four, when you screw up your pitch, just say, hey. I really screwed that one up. Can I try again? You'll almost always get a good laugh out of it. Alrighty, folks. Nick, how can people help us out? Well, don't screw up your review of thirty minutes to presidents club. Again, my favorite pastime in the world is going on to Apple Podcasts and reading the heartwarming reviews from our loving fans. So if you haven't left a heartwarming review and you'd like to, it would make Nick's day. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty Minutes to President's Club. Club.
