## Transcript

Today, we have the number one mid market SDR at Gong facing off against one of the best heads of sales development in the game doing a cold email showdown. We're competing for bragging rights, this awesome gold trophy that we have here. So we're gonna do three rounds. Each round's ten minutes, and what you're gonna be given is a different product. We're gonna have triggers, and you're gonna be expected to write an email, and you're gonna be judged based on three criteria. So the first thing I'm looking for is packaging. It's subject line and preview text. Right? What is the initial reaction to the email, and do I wanna open it? Is the first thing. Email body second. So I'm looking for, is it personalized? Does it have good solution language in there, problem language, etcetera? Does it make me wanna open and then read the rest of the email? And then lastly, style. So this is like your personal flare, is it formatted correctly, length of email, etcetera. And then I'm gonna grade each round, and then the winner is the person that scores the most out of the three. What's going on, folks? If you're hearing this, we've got a really killer new YouTube video up, and I I honestly think you'd really enjoy watching the visual breakdown on our YouTube channel. So if you just click the link below in the show notes, it'll take you right to the video. We'll see you there. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes.
