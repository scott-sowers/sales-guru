## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arma Troke. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Skalski. And today, we have a repeat with Adam Ochart of Gong, who just made President's Club, by the way. And Nick, why should people listen? This was the best show we've ever done about how to successfully manage a trial and turn that trial or proof of concept into a closed won deal. Three, two, one, pilot. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Eleven x, your your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Adam. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Yeah. I love just right thrown on the spot. The three things that I would love to highlight, things that I've had immense success with, I didn't do early in my my sales career. Number one, and we're gonna center these around running a POC and running a pilot, is number one, multi threading. So the ability to get individuals single threaded throughout the sales process typically starts with one blast email you send to everyone. And then the typical way we handle that is a reply all. I opt against that. From that thread, we branch off into a ton of single threads and start a bunch of singular conversations, building champions. What's number two? Built just around building success criteria. I know that this is discussed often. I'm sure every sales leader is like, duh. But really honing in on what success criteria means for everyone, what an exit criteria looks like at the end of that pilot. Right? People pilot the purchase, right, not the test drive. So making sure that you're aligned there is really important. I think also letting the prospect define what that is without putting any ideas in their head. Right? You don't wanna make it harder for them than they already think and make sure that they they define that. The third area is pretty straightforward and something I organically am good at, but finding something to talk about. Right? Small talk correlates to to much more familiarity and trust. And I think in today's world, it's it's funny. Like, you're all in my living room right now. Right? Like, it's it's a different experience than it was before COVID. So making sure that someone's excited to talk to you, is really important. I go backwards by, you know, trying to do a little research on these individuals. It's a little bit creepy, a little bit stalkerish, but I look at their LinkedIn, get a feel for what they like as a person. I'm an athlete. Right? I like the bike. If they're on Strava, I'll find them. Find anything you can about them to breach just a little bit of of fun small talk to kick things off. Alrighty. So we gotta dig into this POC thing. We haven't talked about it a ton. And so oftentimes, unless you're like Gong where it's super easy to spin up a pilot, POCs can eat up engineering resources, and so you wanna make sure that there's commitment. And so could you talk about first, at what point in your sales cycle are you saying now is the time to kick off the pilot? I I think when you have the exit in line, like, you already know what we need to do. And it's funny you say, like, in in Gong's world where it's easy to set up a pilot. It really is. But we run the gamut. Right? There's instances where it's a little bit difficult from a tech perspective, and I'll lean more on that. Right? A little bit more on the technical side. If you have a path to a pilot, a path to what a successful pilot looks like, and then you have exit criteria aligned. You have those three areas. All systems are a go. Anytime you do anything without those three, you run a risk of, like you said, burning resources. Adam, can you talk a little bit about how you marry discovery with the request for a pilot? Because I imagine you have people who show up and they're like, yeah. You know, I've used Gong before. I just wanna do a pilot with my team and get this thing going. And I'm sure there's part of you that's like, yeah. I wanna get that thing going, but you need to talk about the success criteria. So somebody asked you that. How do you reply? How do you facilitate more discovery? It's a good question because it's legitimately something we reckon too. I think it starts actually with the upfront contract. Right? How you're setting the expectation early on that it is our responsibility to have a successful pilot. And we cannot do that without truly understanding what's gonna drive success for their business. When you can align on that, and I think that get them to understand that we're investing in this project together, and the idea is to make it successful, You have every right in the world to slow things down and say, hey, maybe I missed the mark, but I don't feel like we have enough meat on the bone here. What are we missing? What are we solving for? I think it comes down to equal business stature. You need to truly believe that your time is as valuable as theirs. And if you don't, you're just not gonna be set up for success. You're gonna let someone drive this the cycle, and you're just gonna get steamrolled. And I say that because it's happened to me plenty of times. So could you give us a sense of when you're setting that expectation upfront, what does it sound like? Like, literally, what are you saying in your upfront contract around what the expectations will be for the discovery today and then the eventual POC? I'm sound of trained. So it's kinda like what I lean on a lot. I'm a huge, huge fan of using biggest concern during the agenda. So, like, an exact excerpt that I would probably say something along the lines are like, hey, Armbrun. My biggest concern, we can technically set this thing up really quickly. We can get your reps using it right away. But if we don't truly know what the success criteria is and how we can present this to your business in a meaningful way, At the end of this pilot, we don't have a path forward and nobody wins. So it won't take a lot of time. But if you and I can sit down and truly dig in and and quantify what we need to prove out here, it's gonna set us up for success down the road. So that sound like a fair use of our time before we dive into the technical setup. And then from that point on, you've gotten them to agree to it. I would love to understand. I know Gong is a specific type of business, but what are some of the success criteria that you're willing to agree to versus you say no. No. No. No. Like, we we can't agree to that upfront? First of all, you bring up a good point. Right? Part of that conversation is expectation setting. I think everyone wants a silver bullet. Nothing out there will deliver that specifically during a POC, whether it's a week, two weeks, a month. Some people have upwards of three to six month POCs. So aligning expectations is huge. As I said earlier in my three actual insights, one of the things is to let people predefine what that success criteria is. Reason being, typically people come in with really low expectations. The last thing you wanna do is come in and like set their expectations really high with like, hey, we're gonna move the sun and the stars for you. So number one, let them set it and see what that looks like. Then off of that, something that's actually really interesting that I noticed is oftentimes that's not aligned with what we talked about in discovery. You can pull back and say, I'm a little bit confused. Your success criteria is rep adoption, yet you're telling me that we need to show you in surface competitive intelligence in late stage deals. I feel like we should align those two. From the discovery that we ran, we can guide their success criteria towards something that we know we can show. Right? And that's the other part. The third thing I'd say is, also, they need to know that a POC is is to give you a glimpse into the power of the platform. It's not to deliver what you get from a full deployment over the course of, you know, twelve to twenty four months. So make sure that if they say, hey. We really need to execute on truly understanding the gaps between our a and b players in our instance. Right? I'll tell them, like, hey. I don't always show that to people, but what I I show is leading indicators. And what you'll start to see is how this will eventually show you the full suite of what's happening on your Salesforce. So number one, expectation setting is really important. Number two, making sure that we're aligned with the success criteria. And then number three, saying, hey. We have the end goal in mind, but we want to accomplish. Let's make sure that we can get you there by showing you just a glimpse of what it looks like and kind of a forecast of what's to come. Adam, I wanna go back to Arman's very first question, which is about when do you actually go ahead and and grant that POC? What do you do when someone's just like, yeah. I don't wanna talk about success factors. I just kinda wanna see how this thing works. Yeah. I mean, I think that we have the right to say no, candidly. And I think that in that situation, pushing back is actually gonna build someone's respect for you. Right? Again, it comes down to like and that's why the the biggest concern is so powerful. Right? If you set that in, you can go back to that. Hey, Arman. Like, again, I mentioned this at the beginning of the call. My biggest concern was x y z. I've done this a ton of times, and I found that historically, not just myself but across our entire team. If we are not aligned mutually, this isn't gonna be successful. Right? And and I just forgive me for being skeptical. I'm in sales. Right? Like, you can use language along those lines, but you really have to humble people and let them know, like, hey. I need you to work with me here. And at that point, you should be a trusted adviser. Right? We're gonna kick off a POC. The hope is that they'll lean on you there. It it does happen though, Nick, and and you have to push back. So on some of your bigger deals, I'm curious. You're collecting pretty sensitive info. You're collecting customer calls and all of that stuff. And and do you ever find that a pilot can actually slow down a deal because it, triggers vendor review? Or have you found any tricky ways to get around the procurement process and not slow down a deal and make sure that a pilot actually accelerates the sales cycle? Yeah. I think that, like, from a data perspective, pilots increase our close rates. They do have longer cycles, but they're way more predictable, right, because it's a sticky solution. So I'm willing to take that risk. Something I tell people all the time is I'm 100% focused on bringing Gong on the right way. Right? And that might mean it takes a little bit longer. That might mean we have a couple extra meetings. That's fine by me. I'm a huge fan of selling through a pilot because people truly know it's an investment that they're excited about. I think sometimes communicating that to those people, again, adds a layer of trust If people are more than willing to then take your lead and take a suggestion. Right? In those instances, sometimes I'll just position like, hey. Along with that, I think we can nail this in a week. I don't think we need to go to a pilot or a three week pilot. So I think it allows you an opportunity to build trust because, yeah, it takes a little longer. The truth is, Armand, we're gonna have to go through that process eventually anyway. Adam, I wanna talk about we've gotten to the point where we've defined some exit criteria, some success criteria. You've gotten around Armand's procurement or data security issue. We're in the trial now, or we're in the POC now. What are some common pitfalls that you see other salespeople fall into when they're actually initiating and they're in the phase of potential customers using my thing? I think a few things come to mind. Number one, they focus on everyone in the POC. And and that can be overwhelming. Right? We can run POCs with in my world, right, north of thirty, forty people at times. I think the most important people to focus on are the power users and the non users. Right? Kind of forget about everyone in the middle. Something that I believe is someone that's not a believer in your solution that becomes converted in the POC has a ton more value to you as an individual than someone that's already a champion. So if you can convert two of the people at the bottom of the pack, that's extremely powerful because that'll communicate volumes to the DM. And the people at the top, they're your coaches. Like, you need to tap into those people and say, hey. I love talking to power users. Can you talk me through how you use it? And you start to, like, build a little camaraderie. Hey. Let me show you a couple of things you probably didn't know. And those people then will be kind of like your inside man, inside woman in terms of helping you out navigating that cycle. So number one, like, don't focus on everyone. Focus on the outliers, the top and the bottom. The second thing is it's easy to get caught up in a pilot on executing the pilot and forget about all the other things. I had so one of my rougher months, I went back and looked at the data and I was like, what is going on? My pilots were longer than anyone else's, had a lower conversion rate. I was talking about budget less frequently in in a decision process. So so caught up in, like, making this pilot successful. I forgot that at the end of this, we gotta make a business decision. We have to get CFO approval. We gotta get through legal. We gotta get through security. Right? The best people run all those details congruently with the pilot itself. So it's almost like two separate projects you're managing. So, Adam, I wanna dig into that a little bit more. My guess is when you set up the pilot, you gotta integrate their stuff, and you're probably starting with a demo of the pilot with their data. But then you're not just throwing it over the fence and just saying, alright. Play with the thing and then two weeks, I'll knock on your door and ask you to buy Gong. So what are you doing after the pilot is in their hands to stay on top of it? Yeah. It's it's as many continuous meetings as possible. Right? In our world, we are typically meeting with with as many individuals that are using it as possible, meeting with champions, say, hey. Can you help me by let's go in your instance. Why don't you show me what you're looking at? And we can align what's going on with your success criteria, build the deck together. Again, it's it's so important to have that champion that's gonna be there to guide with you. If not, yeah, you're not in control. You're not driving the car anymore. Adam, one of the things you were talking about in the prep call was soliciting feedback from the different folks who are actually involved in this and then rolling it up to your decision makers. Can you talk about what you're doing there? For sure. Yeah. I I think that whenever you build, like, the business case deck or the go no go deck right around, hey, this is why we should move forward after the POC, something that I didn't do early that I'm doing now is is putting testimonials from the end users themselves. People are investing in our solution so that their team is really excited about it. If the reps themselves aren't raving for it, it's just not going to be a success for us. Something I've done is gotten testimonials from the end users themselves, gotten the permission to use it, and baked it into my slide deck. It literally I feel like every single time I've done it, it's copied by surprise. Like, oh, interesting. Cool. It's good to know that so and so feels that way. That's awesome. I mean, one of the things that I love that you're doing is you're, like, you're trying to convert, like, the grumpiest person on the team so that by the time you get to the end of this thing, you're like, the VP of sales is like, man, Arman always shoots down everything, and he never adopts new sales tech. And then he's like, wait a minute. Arman said he loved this thing, and it's gonna change his world? And it's like, it's kind of it gives some credibility to it's not just the happy go lucky Nick guy who's like, yeah. I love the thing. It's Arman said he liked it. You mentioned previously you talked a little bit about setting concurrent next steps where at the same time it's doing that trial, you're also doing the security review. And I'm wondering if you can talk about that a little bit. I think that's it's been really powerful for my sale. Yeah. I mean, part of that pilot setup, prep is is aligning on all of those meetings. And if I don't get all those meetings in the calendar beforehand, it's gonna be a messy process. I'm gonna chase my tail. So aligning on who's gonna take point across all those is important. Right? In my world, I'm typically selling to a sales leader. Who's gonna own implementation? Who's gonna own security? Who's gonna own legal? Who's gonna this? They're happy to pawn those things off. And then at the initial, like, launch of that pilot, it's like, hey. Hey, Nick. Tom put me in contact with you to help run through this legal review. Hey, Armand. Tom put me you know, it's like you have these other things that are going. I track everything on a sheet that I share with the prospect that has all the dates and has all the deliverables. You can comment on those sheets if you're using a Google Sheet. So it's a good, like, medium to communicate with people. That's on the other end. It's it's different from actual calls. And yet, that's, like, a really, really powerful way that I've been able to drive those timelines. The last thing that I'll highlight as well, I don't do this enough, but when I do it's always, always successful, is shared Slack channels. That's another medium that I use quite often where I'll reach out to someone and say, like, hey, your team's gonna have a ton of questions and you're gonna be the conduit in which they ask them. I can take the noise away from you and put everyone in a room together in a Slack channel. And on that, I can work with them directly. Something that's cool, if you have a shared Slack channel, everyone that's on it, you can DM. So now it's like, boom. Now I have direct access to everyone where they're communicating. Right? It's it's really, it's a life hack. It's kind of a Trojan horse. That one is freaking money, dude. We do this with our customer success folks. And every single time we mentioned that our customers have a Slack channel, with our folks, they don't have to go with this ticketing system or go through the email chain. That is huge, but I've never heard somebody use that inside of a sales cycle. That's pretty sweet. Yeah. It's great. I have some of them still from cycles I closed, like, months ago that are still open, and I ping them for, like, referrals all the time or, like, hey. Can you hop on a customer reference? Like, I don't wanna get rid of these. They're, like, really powerful. So, Adam, I wanna ask about something that you mentioned way at beginning with your actionable sales tactics. So you mentioned that you were using pilots to multithread your deals as well. And so could you walk us through what what does that look like? How are you getting to other parts of the organization using a pilot? Yeah. So it starts with the trainings that we're running in the workshops. Right? So I typically break it into three buckets. We're gonna have, like, a manager exec training. Right? We're gonna talk from, like, the sales leadership team. We're gonna have a in our world, a collaborator training, which is people outside of the sales team that want access to our platform. Typically, that marketing product, everyone wants to know what's happening. The third tier of that is gonna be the rep training itself. Right? So in those exact trainings themselves, I then follow-up again with that post email saying, hey, here's a link to the call. Here are the main things we talked about. And that right there is like my gateway to everyone. So from there, I'll single through all those people that I I wanna talk to and I talked about personally going after the power users and the people that aren't there. So maybe the people super involved in that training session, and maybe people that didn't say anything didn't have their camera on. Right? Hey, Armand. Candidly, Gong's a super powerful tool for people in your role. I'm sure you're super busy probably multitasking. But if you had any specific questions that you weren't comfortable asking, feel free to ping me. And copy paste that, send that to everyone that I didn't hear from on that. Right? I all of these things just incrementally increase your chances of getting a champion, and you kinda have to play that card. One of the things that I've been doing, Adam, is when I've got a big group on, like, one of those kickoff calls is my company uses Webex, and I think Zoom, you can do the same thing. I'm privately messaging each person in the chat. So, like, I'm having my solutions consultant talk about our product, and I'm actually trying to message each person while the thing's going on, especially if they're the ones who don't have their camera on because I want them to feel like I care and we're engaged. So that's one thing I've been doing to, like, draw people out. Yeah. Like, I I should do that. I sometimes poke fun at people that aren't saying anything or anything. Like, I should, like, Nick, appreciate the input. Anyone else? And, like, Nick hasn't said a single word. His camera's off. And Nick always comes off, like, you son of a yeah, dude. Everything's good. Thank you. So, Adam, let's say we finally gotten through this POC. The Slack channels are popping off. You got this great report. One of the things that's tricky about your solution is there's not this big event that it's, like, today, we need Gong right now. And so how do you actually drive these folks to make a decision and drive them to close? Yeah. It's funny. In terms of, like, linear timelines, there's no, like, line item bygone. We don't align the budget cycles in my business unit at least. Right? I'm not selling to, like, the Fortune five hundreds. The pilot is genuinely the way that we can drive a timeline. Right? We make it time bound. We align on success, and we're able to deliver on those specific metrics. Right? We have a compelling business case. We have a ton of people that love the platform. So with that in mind, I mean, the reality is we do have rigor around how long these things can run, and they do get shut off. And the dream state is to get to a point where someone says we can't turn this off. We have to roll off into a partnership, and that's, like, leverage. Right? Then we begin the negotiation, and that's where the fun part starts. It's not fun if you haven't run a successful pilot. You haven't built up success criteria. Right? Because at the end of the day, it comes down to, like, hey. You asked me to deliver on these specific things. Did I? You should be able to back it up if they say no. Well, hold on. Hold on. Like, this is what we surface. Right? X, y, and z. So yeah. So a mixture of knowing the business case you're trying to build, aligning with that success criteria, being able to present it, and then having the ability or the necessity to turn that pilot off. Like, that is how we drive our timelines. You talked about how we actually drive this thing from a timeline standpoint, but you've mentioned this this slide deck a couple times too. And you're you're putting all this stuff together and building a larger business case and presenting it to the team. So my guess is you're not sending them 17 slides with all of your customers logos on there. So what's actually going into that business case deck? It's gonna essentially have a highlight of the things that we discussed that they wanted to see. A recap of what those things look like and how we're able to quantify them. Right? A good instance is someone will ask us, like, from a competitive perspective. Right? How many of our ops are being impacted truly? Because CRM isn't telling them that. Right? We can sit down with them in a prep meeting and actually surface that within our UI. Leveraging that, getting permission to steal screenshots from those sessions is really powerful including those in. I typically like to show people things they weren't expecting. We use BI tools around adoption and candidly, like, people use our platform. It's very, very rare that we don't have vast adoption and addiction across all of our users. So showing them what adoption looks like so they know that they're not buying shelfware. And then the kicker is if you can teach them one thing that they didn't know about their business that you learned during the POC, that's a grand slam. Because it gets the years going of like, holy crap. What else am I missing? Right? And you can kinda highlight that. The final slide I typically include is what does the future hold? Right? So what do things look like from here on out? What else can I expect? What does the intelligence gonna look like? Then you have your standard, like this is what our onboarding or continuous support looks like. Those are the typical slides. If I'm recalling them, it's essentially what you wanted to execute on, how you executed on it, typically user adoption, and then try to teach them one thing they weren't looking for, and then the post sale process. It's typically seven slides. So we talked about the success criteria. What if they had three things and you did two of them really, really well, and one didn't necessarily meet what they were looking for? And maybe you have a reason behind that. I'm curious how you go into that conversation where you met someone what they were looking for, but not all of it. I would definitely lead with that, call that up first, and, like, take it out of their arsenal. Because you know that you have, like, these haymakers behind you with, like, number two and three. Let's just muddle number one. Let's talk about how we could solve that in the future, and now let's get into the juicy stuff. The number one thing you can't do, I think, is shy away from it because then someone will bring it up and it'll just bite you. I think calling those things upfront are extremely powerful. Alright, Adam. This has been a master class on how to run and set up a successful pilot or trial, and I'm, like, itching to go out and try your Slack channel thing right now. So we're gonna end with the final question, and we've changed it since you were last on the show. The final question here is and I'm gonna make this specific to your trial stuff. What's one piece of sales dogma or belief that other salespeople have about trials that you think is complete crap and should be thrown in the trash? I think that building the business case is the most important thing. I personally believe building champions and building business cases are equal value. And candidly, I think people get deals pushed across the line, not business cases. So I probably lean heavily towards building a champion is the most important thing or an army of champions relative to the business case itself. Love it. Anything you wanna plug before we hop off, Adam? Nope. Support local businesses. Go to Tia Margarita if you're in San Francisco. That's my my official sponsor. There you go. Thanks for listening, everybody. If you see Adam on the streets of SF, buy him a margarita and stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Adam Ochart include, number one, you gotta set up your exit criteria upfront before you even touch the POC. Do not agree to something that you cannot accomplish. Number two, when you're asking for that exit criteria, let them set the expectations first. You might have something that is a much higher expectation, and then you might realize that their expectations are in the floor. So let them talk first. Number three, when you start that pilot, focus on your power users and focus on your non users. If you can convert some of the non users to users, that is 10 times more powerful than the person who was already your biggest fan. And then lastly, number four, Nick's favorite, the Slack channel. When you're working on a pilot, open up that Slack channel with one of your prospects. Get everybody in that pilot in your Slack channel. And Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Then you can DM them one by one, and that's how you multithread a deal. Nick, where can people help us out today? Well, I would love it if the listener would do a pilot of subscribing to thirty minutes to presidents club. If you're listening to the show and you haven't subscribed, would you please do it? Because it helps me and Armando and it ensures that you actually hear from us every week, which I don't know, maybe you don't want. But give the subscription button a click, pilot us, and we'll catch you all next week on thirty minutes of President's Club.
