If you guys aren't using AI for prospecting and particularly perplexity, you're missing out on a lot of good gems. So anytime I'm starting to do account research, that's actually going to start with perplexity. So for example, I work for an AI company. Anytime I start a search, I ask perplexity, hey. Who at the firm is most likely to have AI initiatives? Mhmm. At that time, perplexity will pull the individuals and any articles associated with them, and that actually allows me to write much more detailed and relevant emails using language of the prospect. And that's really helped us improve and increase reply rates, as well. I mean, a lot of people two or three years ago have seen the shitty emails, right, that AI has pumped out. And I think that there was this thinking that, hey, this AI thing is gonna be as easy as when sequences came out. I'm just gonna be able to hit a button and type in a search, and it's gonna do all the thinking for me. When in reality, it's not that easy. Right? There's a there's a training process, and I'm curious. How do you train the AI to get it to the point to where it actually does give you useful information? It's a little less of a training process, and it is still very fairly manual, but it's giving you such better information. So, for example, like, instead of doing a Google search and trying to read an article and find all this information, what the AI is doing is just shortening this gap. So something that used to take you thirty minutes, sixty minutes to write an email, now you're in about, like, five to ten minute range where it's identifying all of the relevant prospects at an account. It's giving you actionable emails, actionable tips, actionable articles that you can use, but I'm still manually writing the email. I have some baseline templates, you know, that I still have saved in SalesLoft, but these are actually custom emails. You know, I have 50 accounts. These accounts are law firms for the most part. It's not like we have thousands of contacts to burn through, so each touch is important. So we these are still manual touches, but the AI enables you to get a higher volume of them out at a much more effective commentary. And so me, I actually used to have really bad writer's block. And so something that AI has been really helpful for me, I can put an okay email into ChatGPT, ask it to improve, ask it to make suggestions, and then run through a few options that I like best, and then put pull those emails out. And now they're custom, they're relevant, and they are still, like, manual. So it's not a it's not a silver bullet, but it's just dramatically increasing that efficiency. And for me, for somebody who has historically struggled with writer's block, it's just really helpful to have that backup support to really improve what I'm doing. So when you're doing an account plan, what does the prompt sound like? How do you how do you guide it to give you, like, the nuggets? Are you telling it what your company is and what it does, giving it example case studies? Like, what are you doing in the prompts to make sure that you get your information spit back out at you? Yes. So for me, I actually prefer to do it a little bit more piecemeal. So I like phase one. I like to pull the contacts that I'm looking for. So I look for law firms. I know who I wanted to find. So I wanna find people on the executive committee, people on the innovation team, individuals with AI in their job titles. That's sort of like step one of my research. Then for step two, I actually ask now I'm looking for things that I can write and comment on. So then for phase two, I'm asking, has anybody actually referenced AI publicly? Has anybody referenced anything that I can find? Then I'm having perplexity pull all that information, and I can build that into my account plan as step two. Then the third thing that I'm doing for actually writing and pulling things in, you know, we've had some people at our company who have made internal GPTs, And these are actually really easy. We can include a little YouTube short in the show notes, but you can upload all of your case studies. You can upload referenceable customer lists. And then when you're going to the actual composing phase, say you wanna find five other Canadian firms. You have your referenceable customers. You can say, give me three other Canadian firms that I can reference in this email to make it more relevant as well. So that's sort of my process. That's kind of like a three step process for going from cold to contacts to why I'm actually reaching out is the is the structure that I have for outbounding. So it's like targets, finding the people, there's intel that you have it gathered for you, and and then there's composing the message. And and then proof proofreading and, you know, helping me, fire fire those out at an appropriate rate. What you're doing is you're saying, hey. Help me identifying the partner on the tech committee and the innovation partner and the associate onboarding partner, like the people who have leadership roles, not just their partners at the law firm, and you're identifying the people to reach out to. Then what you're doing is you're saying, hey. Help me find a nugget of information that I can reference when I reach out to one of these people. And that's what is actually going into the email that you are writing right now, mostly by hand, but with some proofreading from Chad GbT. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock.
