## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my co host, Mark Coscalo. And today, we have the VP of sales over at Guesty. It's the one and only, Jonah Mandel. Mark, why should people listen? Jonah has been the guest so far that has really been able to articulate thoughtful ways of doing change. Like, we talk in this episode about helping people get promoted and how to change behavior. And I'd say there's two or three just very tactical things that require a lot of thought and effort that he goes into really deeply here that I think a lot of people that are tackling those type of problems would benefit from. That's right. And I hear if you listen to this episode all the way to the end, you will get promoted. So three, two, one, begin. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Alrighty, Jonah. Welcome to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Tip number one. Before promoting from within, test drive. So we've all been there turning your top performing account executive into a manager. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Give them actual projects and assignments that are outside of their scope as an AE and as a closer and more in line with what they're gonna do as a manager. An example, have them lead a team meeting. Have them train a new hire, and then also have them join a leadership meeting to show their managing up skills and actually walk leaders through the metrics from last quarter. Boom. What's number two? Tip number two. Driving behavior change starts with you as a leader. What does that actually mean? So an example that a lot of us are probably struggling with today, how do we take inside inbound sales folks, turn them in to outbound machines? To me, it boils down to three things. You have to hire for it, you have to comp it, and you have to make sure that it's a topic of conversation in every meeting. So hiring for it. A lot of times working with your people or recruiting teams, they are trying to find profiles of candidates that match the profiles of folks that are sitting in seat today. If you wanna change the culture, you have to sit down with your HR team, with your recruiters, and you have to say, hey, I know Johnny and Jill have x, y, and z attribute. We need to bring in a different type of person. Here is what we're actually looking for. Comp plan. It's not just about top line revenue. You also need to implement whether it's spiffs, accelerators, presidents club for folks that are hitting outbound and actually bringing in deals that are not through the traditional inbound channels. The next, highlighting in every team meeting. At the end of the quarter, when you do that review of last quarter and you highlight everyone that's doing an amazing job, have a third line item that actually says, hey. Jill hit the highest outbound number. Jill, how did you do it? Share it with the group. Alrighty, Jonah. Bring us home. What's number three? Tip number three. Setting proper expectations during the interview process. It's really important that we don't oversell during the interview process. We all lean that way whether it's selling software, selling candidates. I don't wanna say dissuade someone from coming into the organization, but make it very clear what the role actually looks like, the good, the bad, and the ugly. An example, for new folks that we're hiring a guestee, outbound is a huge initiative for us. I actually tell the candidates what percentage of their pipeline is going to be self sourced. I take it another step from there and I actually show them what does self sourced at guestee means. It means being out in market, planning your own event, not just going through Salesforce Force and enrolling people in outbound campaigns, but being very, very specific what self sourced actually looks like. Alright, Joan. I I wanna dig into this idea of the test drive. Like, you're gonna put people in a car and see if they can actually drive before you sell them the car. I love that idea. But I think a a lot of people get distracted when you give them shiny, new, interesting things. And then what ends up happening is we all know the best way to get promoted is, like, crush your current role. And then they stop crushing because they're doing all this other stuff. How do you set it up so that somebody understands you gotta keep doing your role, but I'm gonna give you this other thing to get some experience and to give you some of that juice you're looking for and trying something new? Yeah. It's not easy. I think at the end of the day, it goes back to setting proper expectations. You have to tell this individual for the next three months, this might be the most challenging three months of your career. If I tell the rest of the team that I'm promoting Mark to a sales manager and Mark had the worst quarter of his career, that's a bad look for me. That's a bad look for Mark. And, hey, it's great that Mark learned how to run a team meeting, but the finance team doesn't care. The team doesn't care. In sales, there's a scoreboard. So I guess to answer your question directly, I am very, very clear with the expectation and the understanding that I'm asking this person, can you take on two roles for the next three months? Here's what success looks like at the end of the three months. It's you need to come in over a 100% to your target, but here's the baseline requirement for your IC performance and here are the two or three things that I'm going to ask you to really step up over the next three months. So you got the person, you set the expectations, but then you got the team. All of a sudden the team shows up, and Jonah's leading team meetings. Like, what the hell? Like, why is Jonah doing this? Why am I not doing it? I see some dominoes that happen because all of a sudden now somebody's doing something outside their role. How do you help the people with the expectations around that? I think throughout my career, I've always had sales orgs where there's, you know, maybe two or three candidates that are right there, and they might expect the promotion. But what I try to do is be very, very clear with Johnny and say, Hey, Johnny, here's the reason why Jill is getting the first crack at this. She did X, Y, and Z over the last three or six months. So, I try not to hide behind it. And I actually go to the folks that may be in contention for that promotion. I make it very clear that, like, hey. If you keep performing, there will be x, y, and z opportunity down the line. So people are not wondering why is Jill leading this team meeting and not another person on the team. Do you give everybody a crack at it? Or if Joe crushes, does Joe get the job? I don't give everybody a crack at it. That one person is chosen because of part of it is performance. Part of it is, are they helping others? Are they willing to step up and work with other departments? And do they want to spend thirty minutes with marketing and explain what campaigns are working, what campaigns aren't? So I do try to test folks even before the test drive and see, are they willing to take time away from closing to help others? And that gives me the confidence to say, hey. Person x, you're the first person that we're gonna give this pilot to for the next three or six months. And if you earn it, it's your job. So I'm gonna just pause for a second, Mondo, because this right here to me is one of the definitions of a great leader. Is being a great leader doesn't mean that you're always fair, meaning you give equal opportunity to everybody. What it means is you clearly explain what you're doing and why you're doing it, and then you follow through on the expectations that you set and saying, well, hey. I got three people that are all great. Let me let each one of them lead the team meeting for a quarter. And next thing you know, Jonah can't hire anybody for a year because he's got two people slogging through team meetings when he already knows the person he wants to go. And I I go back to that Jake Dunlap interview, Armand, where I think is one of the coolest things that we've talked about so far, which is if you're trying to get in the club, if you do all the right stuff, that means you get to move to the front of the line. It doesn't mean you necessarily get to go into the club. And Jonah is the bouncer. He determines who goes in the club or not. Now you can line up and be second in line, and the next thing that comes along, you can be ready for it, or you can be super upset and hurt and jealous because somebody else got to go in for you. I think that's something that a lot of reps and salespeople don't recognize or acknowledge. There's only so much growth that the company can do, and his job is determine the best person for the company and the team to be in there, not to make it so that everybody has a chance to do everything. And sometimes that's really hard. Johnny, you tell me, Do reps don't know how hard that is for you? That's not easy for you to say no to two people that are deserving, is it? Definitely not. I like the point that you're making, and life is tough. At the end of the day, all you can do is try to increase your luck surface area. And by making sure that you have a good relationship with your manager, by making sure you're going above and beyond and doing things outside of your scope of work to better the company, those are all things that are very, very important. So, Jonah, let's talk about, like, handling this conversation Because you talked about there are a lot of times where you'll have a Michael Jordan of a rep or a top rep who really wants to be a manager, and you know in your gut they might not be fit to be a manager even though they're an outstanding rep. How do you navigate that conversation with someone? I have struggled with this for many, many years, and I will say over the last couple years, I think I have improved quite a bit. Having those tough conversations is is never easy. But at the end of the day, the longer you delay those things, and I think maybe Mark said it before, if you keep leading somebody on and they're expecting a promotion down the line, the problem is that negativity and that frustration, it's not specific to that person. That person then will create a toxic environment and start to infect the rest of the organization and say, you're never gonna get promoted. It's never gonna happen. So what I've really leaned into over the last couple years is whether it's the minute you wanna share that feedback, you think about it, you share that feedback directly, constructively, and you always have to take it from the lens of the bigger picture for the company. Like, a lot of people love to use the analogy of team sports in sales. If this person's a team player, they need to understand that I have a job at guesty because I am responsible for the revenue growth of the organization. Unfortunately, my job is not to think about Johnny and Jill's career progression. I'm thinking about that because I want what's best for my team. I want what's best for the company, but I always try to handle those conversations early and often. Be very clear. You don't sugarcoat it, and you explain the rationale, and you always take a team or company first lens when having that conversation. And what I've actually noticed, folks that I thought would quit on the spot, they appreciate it and they either work to get better or guess what? They stay in that senior account executive role. They make a lot of money. They work on some side hustles and some side projects, and they're very happy in the role. They're gonna be upset about it upfront, but you are totally right where there's a silent slow burn that happens in an organization. And the next thing you know, you see a senior rep who's a little bit disgruntled going out on coffee chats with the new reps, and they're just telling everyone who says they wanna be a manager, it's not gonna happen. And they're gonna ask why, and they're not going to have a reason to share with that junior rep. And so, again, you're being transparent having the uncomfortable conversation upfront. Can we make this really, really real? Because I imagine there are managers who are listening to this right now who have a top rep, who is literally asking them to be made a manager today. What are some of the things that you see in a top rep that would lead you to believe this person might not be the best manager versus the reps that you're like, this is not only a top producing rep, but also someone who could be a good manager? The way top performers in sales are trained to think, it is a kill first mindset. You see a comp plan, and the first thought of a lot of top performers that I worked with are, how can I break this comp plan and make as much money as possible? They need to be selfish. They need to think about their calendar, leaving any available slot open for a prospect. How can I fill it up with a revenue opportunity? Folks that I've promoted into management roles, like, sure, they think that way, but they also are willing and able to balance when new hires come on. They're asking you, hey, can I grab Jill and ask Jill to join my next sales call? They are not just thinking about their commission check or hitting 140% to target or president's club. They are actually asking you, can I help with training? Can I take a recorded Gong call and share it in the next leadership meeting? Those are all skills that a lot of times you don't see that in top performers. I can tell you right now, I wanted nothing to do with a marketing meeting. I didn't wanna sit down with the new hires. I wanted to sit in my corner. I wanted to close as many deals as possible. That was just the mindset that I had earlier on in my career. Yeah. I think there are two big things that come out of this. The first is, are you willing to do things that literally you're going to take time that could have been spent selling deals? Are you willing to mortgage some of that time for the long haul investing back in the team knowing that that might not come back to you directly right away? That's number one. But then number two, do you have the ability to coach effectively? And that's the other thing that I oftentimes see isn't always there with the top, top, top sellers. They don't even know why they're good. You ask them to break down someone else's Gong call, and they're just like, oh, man. There are so many things wrong with this, or they can't even break down their own Gong calls. They're almost just, like, doing the highlight reel, but they can't actually explain what they saw in the prospect that led them to ask a certain question. And so for that reason, you need to test for one, their desire to that. Are they willing? And then two, are they able to break things down as well? To me, it's always can the rep explain why they're doing what they're doing that makes them successful? Can they break down the process? Do you understand your own game enough to teach somebody else the game? And if you don't, then, like, why would I ever make you a manager? Because all you're gonna end up doing is turning into a super rep. Like, get me in front of them. I'll close them. And that doesn't help anybody out. That's bad leadership. So I love that, Mondo. Like, it's all about efficacy. That's what leadership is. Can you change your mindset? Can you change behavior? Can you change their skill set? Can you change their energy? If you can't, then you don't get to be a leader. And guess what? Anybody can help change somebody else for the better, whether you're their leader or their manager or not. And I can think of my best rep ever at Outreach. I tried to get him into sales leadership several times. He's the best psychological seller I've ever seen. And the reason I kept trying to get him into leadership even though he didn't want to is every rep would listen to every one of his Gong calls. Any rep that called him, he would spend half an hour on the phone with him. Everybody was copying what he was doing, and I was just like, dude, you're doing it already. He's like, yeah. But I'm working, like, twenty hours a week and making close to 7 figures. He's like, why am I gonna mess that up? And I was like, alright. Good good call, man. But that's the trade I'm looking for is, like, can you not help it? Because if you can't help it, then you're a natural leader. If you're having to be asked to do it, then what am I gonna have to do for you when you're in the job? Another thing that I really struggle with is relating to different personality types and different motivations. Right? I was very motivated by being top of the leaderboard, seeing my name up there. Other people are motivated for different reasons, whether it's being in first place, whether it's money, making an impact, being recognized by the broader organization, moving into leadership, how can you relate to different personality types, different motivations? How can you really get in with those folks, understand that motivation, hone in on it, and figure out how to get more and more out of each team member? Talking about changing roles and giving people a chance to change roles, I'm interested about your second tip, which is if you want your team to change, you have to change. We can't just do a training about how to do discovery calls differently and expect the team to do discovery calls differently. How do you take your leaders and make sure that they're doing the change that you're asking the rep to do? Like, how does that translate? First one, I have to imagine a lot of folks have done this before. But if you're trying to change from inbound to outbound, take your broader leadership team, go through LinkedIn profiles. I'll give you a very clear example. At Capchase, what we did is we sold the product to the VC community. And essentially what we did is we had our strategy team. We downloaded all of our contacts from LinkedIn, the entire leadership team, and we went through them and we all sent each person individual LinkedIn messages. We recorded the calls. We took some funny videos of all of us in conference rooms doing it, and we shared it at the next team meeting to show, hey. This is not beneath us. Here's how we're doing this. We're going through our network. We're sending cold emails. We're dealing with rejection. We're leaving voice mails. Some of our voice mails were garbage. Everyone laughed about it, and we just showed the team, hey. Like, we're doing this. This is the new baseline of what the expectation is for you. So that's example one. That is powerful right there. I love that. I remember on Friday mornings, we'd be do doing these team dial blitzes, and we were trying to get the team to do more outbound. We were scaling up the team. Economy turned. We basically needed to go from three x to four x plus pipeline coverage. And I was like, what am I gonna do? I would alternate. Some weeks, I would be cold calling prospects, and I would just tear through other people's territories. I would be like, assign me tasks. And then other weeks where I didn't have any people to call, I would call candidates, and people would just hear me getting roasted from all of these people who I was trying to get to work for Pave at the time. And so when you get in the floor, when you get in there with your team, there's just a completely different energy that comes to the table. So, Joni, you talk about, one, making the change yourself as a leader. You sprinkled in a few other structural changes you make. So you talked about the hiring profile, which I understand you might be looking for someone with outbound skills. You talked about having a comp plan that incentivizes the change too. There are lots of hot takes around spiffs and incentivizing outbound. Tell me more about what you do there. It's actually not around outbound. It's transitioning from growth at all costs to efficient growth. How do you line up sales with customer success with finance? Essentially, what we're trying to do is throughout my career, any revenue that would come in the door, we would accept it. We would celebrate it. A very, very clear change that we made at Capchase is we wanted to line up the sales incentives with the LTV of a customer. And what we noticed was in certain cohorts of customers or segments, there was high churn. But sales didn't care because sales was comp based on the new logo coming in and at closing. Our CS team had to deal with it, and it created a major, major divide between the two departments. And it also created a huge divide with finance because we were closing deals that might churn after six, nine, twelve months, and they wouldn't renew. So what we did is we tiered out all of our leads and deals, tier one, two, and three. Essentially, if a salesperson closes a tier one opportunity, they get 1.2 logo credit towards their quota. If they close a tier three, they get point seven five. And the way we actually calculated that was, keep in mind, at Capchase, we had a risk and underwriting team that would underwrite the customer before they were closed, and that's when we would tier it. But you can also do that baking it into a lead scoring model as well. That is how we incentivize the sales team to care about the quality of customer that they brought into the Capchase organization. There had to be some downsides. Like, take me a level deeper because that sounds super brilliant, and I'm sure it worked out really great. But there had to be a couple learnings along the way. Like, what did you do wrong? Well, first, the equation that we use with our rev ops team to figure out what was a tier one versus a tier three, We we probably changed that thing 15 or 20 times, which when you're changing what goes into bucket one, two, and three, sales reps will only work with you for so long if you're changing those goal posts every three months. It gets very frustrating. Problem number two is there was a point where percentage to quota was going up into the right. There were a few months where logos were actually going down, and that was a very hard pill for our board to swallow. Mark, the problem there was this cohort of customers that are signing up 01/01/2024, we don't know what the lifetime value is going to be until the renewal date. So it was very much a, hey, Jonah. I'm trusting the work that you're doing here on tiering the customers because, again, commission payouts are going up, customers are going down. To actually see the impact on LTV, that's gonna take some time. So it took a lot of massaging throughout the organization. I bet. That long term, long tail stuff is just a hard pill for a lot of people to swallow. I think when you're in the board meeting and they're talking to you about this, did you have a deck? Do you have an equation? Because, honestly, we know right now, so many revenue leaders are dealing with the how do we grow responsibly. I think this is a very strategic solution of how to align lifetime value and retention to the presales process, which is typically a missing link. How did you get the board to buy into that? I mean, what are we doing here? We did have an advantage again because we were in the lending space. So we had all of this data on all of our customers. So, yes, what we did is we had a deck. We had two years of data, and what we did is we cut all of our customer data based off of the type of business. What is this company's r 40, employee headcount growth quarter over quarter? We had all these different variables, and we looked at companies where the headcount was growing 20% versus 80% over time. Companies that were in prop tech versus HR tech, how are those performing through a downturn in the economy? Is this a need to have or a nice to have? We cut all of that data, and we showed them the different ways that these customers performed over the last two years. And that's how we went to them and say, hey, we don't think that there should be a a large deviation from this performance based off of these, you know, 15 different variables as to what makes a tier one versus a tier three. And we want to align our customer acquisition plan closing more tier one companies month over month. So, like, the last point I will highlight here on this note is when we showed the board our our month over month revenue and logo acquisition, we actually showed all of the bar graphs based off of tier of business. And what they got really excited about was, although maybe logos weren't growing quarter over quarter like they were historically, the orange section of the bar, that was tier one. So really seeing that visual got the board pretty excited about the type of customers that we were acquiring. Super thoughtful. I think the key takeaway is you can align your comp incentives and your comp structure with whatever you're going after. I've seen people do outbound spiffs. I've seen people do deals that are created and closed in quarter type of spiffs, and I'm not the biggest spiff fan. I love how you are not only living the change as a leader, but you're also living the change through the comp plan, the hiring profile, etcetera. Is there anything else that you're doing to properly enable or motivate your team to do this stuff, whether it's metrics you're tracking every week to make sure it's actually happening, whether it's team rhythms or anything of that sort that really get people doing this and in the motion of it every single week? Yeah. I I think the the other point here is just highlighting it, whether it's team meetings, whether it's dashboards. And at Guste, on the top of our our leaderboard, we have three reports, logos, revenue, outbound opportunities. Those are the three everyone wakes up every day. They see those three reports. In our monthly, quarterly reviews, it's top of the dashboard. I think you really have to let folks know this is something broader leadership team is laser focused on. This is what's being talked about. This is something that we view as a very important attribute of a top performer at guesting. Someone who's not just taking what marketing's throwing their way, but able to build a sustainable pipeline on their own through outbound. Boom. Jonah, amazing episode. Unfortunately, it is not fifty two minutes to president's club. It's thirty minutes to president's club, and so we have to leave you with the final question. What is one bad habit that every sales leader out there should break today to make all the teams out there a little bit better? I would say the days, whether you're a CRO, a VP of sales, a head of sales, staring at spreadsheets and not being able to actually do the job or not willing to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. I think with the focus on efficient growth versus growth at all costs, it's gonna be very, very challenging to be a leader. If you're not willing to roll up your sleeves, get your hands dirty. You need again, this might be a hot topic. I've gotten the feedback throughout my career that I like rolling up my sleeves sometimes too much, but you have to be able to sell the product. My recommendation is whether it's CRO, VP of sales, head of sales, join a sales call at minimum every two weeks. You don't have to lead it. You can support it. You can be on an email chain. Join a sales call every two weeks. Don't be afraid of rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands dirty. I really noticed that over the last handful of years, revenue leaders have gotten further and further away from the end customer. Folks, get your hands dirty. We got our hands dirty in this episode. Jonah, this was freaking awesome, man. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alrighty, Mark. It's time for a two by two recap. What do you got for your two? Number one is increase the surface area of your luck. I thought that was like a TM statement by my man, Jonah. Like, go help out. Go do this. Go get involved in this. And I just love that concept of sometimes getting promoted and moving in your career takes luck, so increase that surface area of luck. And number two is don't let someone else's slow burn cause other people to catch fire. And this idea of, hey. I'm gonna tell you what's going on early in the process so that you understand it so that it's not like there's a bunch of frogs in a pot slowly turning up the heat, nobody jumps out, and everybody end up getting boiled. Just crank up that heat in a good kind way and let people jump out of the pot if they need to. I just really love the concept of the slow burn is never just a singular person. It's always affecting people all around them, and then you got a real problem. That was gonna be mine, but it is so good, so I will double down on it. Number three, when you find someone who has the opportunity to be a manager or the potential to be a manager, test drive them first. And as you are test driving them, it is critical for you to go and have the conversations with the other people who are standing in line to be a manager and explain what it means for them to take that step themselves. And then lastly, number four, when you're trying to drive your team to outbound, you gotta make the change everywhere. You gotta tell the team that's what you're focused on. You gotta change your hiring profile. You gotta talk about it in every single team meeting. You need to update every single dashboard. You cannot just ask people to outbound and expect it to happen.
