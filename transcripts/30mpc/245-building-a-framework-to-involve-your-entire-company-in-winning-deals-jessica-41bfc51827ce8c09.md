## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Froeck, and I'm here with my cohost, Mark Casaglobe. And today, we have an outstanding sales leader, the CRO over at user interviews. Mark, it's Jessica Cleck, and why should people listen? Well, Jess and I competed against each other in the great sales loft versus Outreach Star Wars. So if you wanna see us get into it and get, like, really ugly and, like, this podcast gets dirty y'all, like, I'm talking slinging mud, cussing at each other. You should listen. No. Actually, Jess and I are good buddies. We've helped each other out several times throughout the years. But I think the main reason to listen to this one is simple. Jess shows you if you have a framework, you can do some really cool stuff. And you just need to sit down, think about what you wanna anchor something to, figure out how you're gonna run it with your reps, and then just get people to do it. And when you do that, you really get some good things and standardization going on that makes big difference in your production. Well, if Jess is Anakin Skywalker, you're Darth Vader, That unfortunately makes me Yoda with my ears. And so everyone enjoy the battle. Three, two, one. Let's ride. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alrighty, Jess. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Rock and roll. Alright. First one is coach the coach. So we created a guide of a matrix of questions that correspond to every sales stage in our sales process. We created this to standardize the way that our leaders were doing deal inspection, and we standardized this across each segment. So SMB, mid market, enterprise. For us, our sales process has six stages, and we use MEDDPIC across each of those stages. So for us, stage two looks like discovery. So a question or two might look like, what are the defined executive priority metrics? Who are we competing with? If the rep doesn't know the answer, that's okay. That's great. That means the leader has an action that they can point to immediately of go find out that information. But at the end of the week, each leader needs to sign off in Salesforce that they have asked these lists of standardized questions to make sure that the accuracy and the health of the pipeline is there. Great. What's number two? Alright. Number two is called the find the red framework. It's a framework that I've developed that I use in one on ones with my direct reports and with my cross functional partners. It's helped me systematically identify what's working, which is great. We love to celebrate. But more importantly, we need to understand what's not working. And so the framework sort of looks like what's working, what's not, what's your plan to fix, and how can I help? Again, I do this with my directs and cross functionals, and then I will stack rank each week the list of red that I'm going to work on, my number one priorities. And then I will look to my cross functional partners for other red priorities, and then I will push back on my directs for what they can solve themselves. Each week, I also report this up to my leader so they're aware of what's read in the business and our plan to fix it. I would love to fix the fact that we have not heard your third takeaway, Jess. Bring us home. What's number three? Win together. So this is primarily focused at our enterprise segment, but it is an actual win strategy document and call that we schedule with all of our cross functional partners to support winning big deals. The rep will show up with a spreadsheet that has the opportunity name, has the ARR, and then down the left side, we have the MEDDPIC criteria. And across the top, we have red, yellow, green. We also have a note section. So the rep will fill out where we are by letter. So for instance, if competition is red, we'll have the rep explain why it's red. Perhaps it's a feature functionality the competition has that we don't. We will at mention the product individual in the room so they can hear directly from the rep why that is a problem in us moving the deal forward. And then as a follow-up, we will schedule one on one time with them to discuss the trade offs. And even better, we will discuss the opportunity for rewards. For instance, if they prioritize something we need, then we will talk about giving them percentage of the commission when the deal is won. So, Jess, we all know that there's this point at which you have to start getting involved with product in order to get big deals done or to get those bedrock deals done that are missing something that a lot of the market needs. I'd like to dig into this dealing with product a little bit more because, you know, we can get the product door completely out of sorts by doing too many asks, and then we can't innovate because we're doing too many ask for customers and all that kind of stuff. So help me take through a little bit, like, what is in this sheet? Like, how do you work it? When is it required? Is it optional? Like, take me through some of the logistics of this sheet. Yeah. Ultimately, it's not just focused at product. We do have other cross functional partners there, like marketing for support. Product is a big one, particularly in our space. And so the sheet really just helps us hone in on which cross functional partner we really need to leverage to win that deal. I think more specifically in getting product buy in or talking about the potential trade offs of them doing something to help us win a deal, There's a couple things. One, we have a monthly meeting where we are giving customer and prospect feedback directly to the product team. They are hearing real live accounts of what happened in a deal that we won, why we won, why was the product differentiated, and also real live accounts of why we've lost deals if it's been product focused. That helps us really calibrate. We are a research focused company, so we do a lot of internal research that helps them continue to go back and prioritize or stack rank things that what I would call make us more enterprising. We do spend a lot of time talking about trade offs. Right? And we don't bring to the product team small things that we can win with more sales excellence and creativity versus every nice to have that a customer or prospect asks us for, but we really measure the trade off in that conversation of what's in it for them. Right? We have to get products buy in. Ultimately, we don't work in silos, and we want to really have that open collaboration and take their direction of what they are thinking is the true north for the product. But in having them join these win reviews, they can really see firsthand the impact of the change they're going to make, how that's gonna impact this deal, but furthermore, how is it gonna make us more enterprise ready? How are was this gonna help us make and win more deals? And then as I mentioned in the tips, what's in it for them? Product people are sometimes unsung heroes, and they're doing their work a bit in a silo. They don't get commission. And so really seeing how the rep will prioritize if this is something they're gonna push on by saying, okay. I'm willing to give up a percentage of commission to you if you make this a priority because I feel so passionately that this is going to help this deal, but it's also gonna help us win many more deals. It's really just about that cadence of open communication between the scheduled calls and then the one offs and then really like the accountability. When we win that deal, we celebrate the product individual too. So I remember when I walked in the Pave and I was holding up my sign, we'll pay $5 per line of code, and my CEO was pretty mad. But I love what you're doing to incentivize the product team, the engineering team to get behind the different deals you have. But I also hear the thing that you mentioned earlier, which is you can't bring every deal to the table. And there was a point where I got really high up with my team where I was like, guys, we have to stop fighting objections with new features. We're early stage. We were early stage. But now we're growing up. We cannot be fighting objections with features. We need to handle the hard objections, but then bring the right ones to the product table. How do you figure out what is something that is worth bringing to the table? Two things. One is, is this a problem that we're seeing across a myriad of deals and across a myriad of segments. Right? Is this a problem that if we solve, we were going to win exponentially more deals? And then, you know, size the prize. Right? Is it a very large deal? Is it a blue chip logo? Will winning the one deal set us up for success knocking down a different industry, right, if we're selling to insurance, for example, and creating a feature function for State Farm is gonna open the door to Allstate and Farmers and, you know, Liberty Mutual, all these things, then it's worth it. I mentioned the term trade off a couple times, but, truly, that's what it is. Right? Because if you're prioritizing a feature or function or something in product, that means you're deprioritizing something else. So it's really about waiting what that feature and function will do for the organization at large. So could you talk about how much of that onus falls on you as a sales leader to just collect everything from your reps and then selectively choose which deals are worth pursuing versus how much of this product IQ and this company level strategy thinking are you teaching to your reps? In other words, is a rep on your team expected to be able to think through those trade offs on their own and be dangerous enough about the product road map so that they know what and what not to bring up? Yeah. I think certainly the latter, especially at the stage of and size of company we are. You know, we have incredibly tenured reps on our team that have been in a myriad of different roles. Some of them even been product slash sales engineers before, so they can think enough about the product first before saying like, oh, we absolutely need this at every whim. It's more so, again, they're thinking in that trade off terminology. If I ask for this, is it gonna help me win five deals, or am I asking for this because I'm out of creative sales solutions to win a deal? One of the fears that people have of creating a more collaborative sales environment is that our reps aren't going to do the hard work because the easy thing is to just say yes to the buyer. Yes. We'll do that. Yes. We'll build that. Yes. We'll do that. Oh, they love us and all this kind of stuff versus that. You've kinda talked about it more like you pulled out your sales tricks or the sales creativity and really done that. How do you coach your managers to help make sure that the reps aren't becoming dependent on that cross functional start to win versus just, hey. We gotta just win some deals just us here in our squad. We can always bring in the Calvary on every deal. One, I think it's helpful to have that standardization of deal qual questions at the leader level that all of your leaders are asking the same questions at each stage in the sales process. So, again, we use MEDDPIC. So I think the number one focus for us is always identifying the pain. Right? Like, what problem are we solving? At the end of the day, yes, x feature, y feature would help us win the deal, but is that the feature that's really solving the pain? And how do we quantify that pain? How do we blow that pain up into an actual dollar amount? And so I think it really starts with real great deal qualification before we get to the point of, okay, we have exhausted every idea. We've exhausted all of our sales knowledge and tools. The only thing that's gonna make a difference to this customer is a product change, or the only thing that's gonna make a difference is if we offer marketing support here. We use cross functional partners as guidance and collaborators, but not on every deal. Right? These are the biggest deals. The most meaningful deals are the ones where we've earned the right to have the conversation with product to ask them to make a change. That is after an exhaustive process of going through every other step in our sales process and all of the other creative things we can do to win it. Do you really love MEDDPIC? You know what I really love about MEDDPIC is pain. I think if you take nothing else away from a sales process, you have to identify why are they talking to you? What's hurting them that they need a tool or they need your company to fix? What's that problem? So I do love the idea of pain. I do love the idea of champions. I think for me, champions, it's always about constantly testing. Right? Constantly putting them through different tasks to make sure that they're really your champion. I think there's a lot of steps in MEDDPIC that, you know, help you identify what great reps do naturally and just being curious, understanding how buyers buy, understanding the ultimate executive priorities of the organization, and naturally tying our product as a solution there. But I've used a myriad of these types of things before. I mean, back in the day, BANT was good enough. Right? Answer those four questions and move on. I'm not married to it, but for now, I think it's helping us as we standardize and approach, at least have a true north. So you like it. You don't love it. You see some merits of it. Probably see some weaknesses of it. But it does sound like it's a very critical part of how you manage the entire org. So how do you get a rep or a manager to buy into using that? Because, like, lord knows what's going on in those conversations. You think you know, but you probably don't really know unless you really dial in those frontline managers to I love this. This is the value of it. So how are you transferring that conviction in MEDDPIC? Because otherwise, y'all know what the one on one is. Verizon is supposed to come in this week, Jess. Like, what's happening? And we just get a basically useless information doing that. You know what I mean? So what Medpick does for us is create standardization. It creates levity as well. So if you have newer leaders and more tenured leaders, they can speak the same language. And then when the leaders are asking their reps the same thing, if they don't have enough experience or they're kind of lost in, like, okay. You're telling me you feel like Verizon's gonna come in, or my gut's telling me it's good. They love us. But then they can go back to asking actual questions like, what is the decision process then? Where are we in the process? You said we have to go through procurement. We have to do MSA. We have to do legal. Then there's a six day delay because they're in Germany and all of these things. Like, those are very tactical real things, real questions we can ask to be answered to continue to move it forward versus relying on, like, that feeling. I think I inspire the team and the reps with the conviction of this has worked at really great companies. We've won really big deals using this process. Do I think it's the best in the world? There's probably better, and I'll wait for that to come out. But until then, like, these are tried and true questions we can ask that will help us really understand what's happening in the deal. Alright. Let's get into pain. Two ways to do pain discovery. Open ended. Hey. Your CEO walks in, writes three things on a whiteboard, breaks the red marker when he writes the third thing, storms out in a anger field. What did he or she write on the board? That's very open ended. Close ended is, hey. You know, at user interviews, we solve problem one, two, and three. Which one do you have? Very close ended. So when you're doing like, I'm interested. What have you found better? What have you experimented with? Because this is the key. I think we've all come to the conclusion if you're a good salesperson, get to good pain, you get a good deal. Get to crappy pain, you lose a good deal. So, like, what have you experimented with? Like, help us take us through this pain part. I think our approach here has been more open ended, which is more like when we do, like, a first call and we're trying to do, like, quick discovery, what we are doing is we are trying to educate that buyer on sort of the pains we solve. So in a sense, we're trying to inception them with answering the question in the way that we want to. So we're saying like, this is what user interviews is. This is what we do. These are the problems we solve. Now let's talk about what are the pains that you are identifying in your organization, and then we go through those list of pain questions. So I think it's a little bit of both. Like, I would say it's like you kind of inception upfront, so you kinda get in their head a little bit about the ideal pains that we solve. And then the open endedness is where you really, like, get curious and you really dive deep, and then I think you take that back. And, again, that's where you leverage the creativity and messaging and how, like, your product can fit into a solution for them. But I think it's kind of a little bit of both. Like, you kinda gotta lead them to water a little bit, but then you gotta, like, be super curious and understand, like, where are we gonna really, like, dive in. And most importantly, I think it's the pain that we try and prioritize is the one that we can identify, like, quantifiably. Where can we tie that to a revenue problem? For us, for example, all companies do research. All companies want to understand what their customers are thinking about their product and or solution. And if they are shipping a new feature, they need to understand, like, is a customer gonna pay more for that? And if they don't and they create this feature in a silo, then that's a ton of time and resources that they spend with no revenue recognition at the end of the day. So we tie to different revenue driving problems, and I think those are the pains that you really wanna get into. You found it easier or harder to do close or open ended discovery? Like, open ended discovery is dangerous because a rep has to be willing to deal with curve balls because you can get a lot of curve balls when you open up the world versus that close ended discovery. Be a master at these three talk tracks, and you can probably figure out if you have a deal or not. But we all know that the way that you get that huge problem, that huge pain is with the open ended. So have you found it harder to train people on open ended? Like, how do you tackle that? Yeah. I think it's more aligned by segment. So I don't think there just isn't bandwidth in an SMB rep's life to do every single transactional call doing open ended discovery, open ended identification of pain. Right? I think at the commercial level, you get them super proficient on those three talk tracks. And being proficient in those three talk tracks, they can quickly qualify or even better quickly disqualify an opportunity from moving forward. Right? They have a ton they're working on. We want them focused on the highest probability to win deals, and I think getting to that by those closed ended, this is what we do. You don't like it. Let's move on is great. You're totally right, though, Mark. I don't think that is the key to winning enterprise strategic deals. I think you have to have a tenured experienced rep that can handle curve balls, that have seen all of the things before and knows what to expect when they're opening that can of worms of open ended lines of questioning. But that also leads to much deeper levels of connection with that prospect or customer because you are really presenting as a consultant. You're really presenting as someone that cares deeply about how to help them hit their personal goals, how they're gonna hit their company goals. And we might not even solve that problem, but we, again, can figure out a way to go to products and say, this is a trade off to go win this deal. This is something that's gonna move our company in a different direction. So I think it's really segment based. What questions do you ask to make sure you got a real pain? Because I find that most reps where they mistake is they sell to preference. Oh, we'd like this more than this. They sell to projects. Projects are things that are subsets of a pain. Right? Or they sell the pain. And the people that sell the pain typically win. So how do you make sure that they got the right pain? Yeah. I think there's a couple questions we ask. Like, what is the pain? Why is this a pain? Like, ask why three times. Right? Why is this a pain? Why? Why again? Why now? We also ask, like, who else cares? Why would this pain be prioritized over other pains? Why is this pain personally important to the person you're talking to? Why would this pain be personally important to the CEO or more importantly now, the CFO? Those are the types of questions we ask more like trying to get to the immediacy, trying to get to the root pain versus, like you said, more of that tactical, like, yeah, it's hard to find researchers. Okay. Well, that's just like a really basic pain, but it's hard to find researchers because we're trying to develop this feature or function for our customer base, and we really need them to have experience here. And this is, like, the big project I'm working on, see, all of these layers. But I think most importantly, it's like, why is this a priority? Who else needs to be involved or who else cares? How is this tied at the executive level? So, Jess, I wanna go all the way back to some of the other stuff that we were talking about when it comes to working cross functionally and also starting to move of all of your sales or potentially upmarket. And this is pretty related to what we just talked about is a couple things need to be in line. Number one, your product needs to be able to support enterprise customers. Yeah. Number two, your operations team needs to be able to support them. Number three, you need to have skilled enough sellers to be able to actually close these deals. But then lastly, number four is it needs to be a good enough opportunity for the business, and that's probably what comes first. It needs to be the right thing for the business. And so I'm curious. Even if you have an example in the past, you talked about preparing your team, your company to move up market. How do I even think about in the first place if moving up market is right or not for my company or my team? Yeah. It's a great question. And one I've been asked is I've been pulled into companies to help us build sort of the strategy to go up market. And I think I look at, like, around seven things. You mentioned a couple of them. One, is there demonstrable product market fit? Are we selling our product? Right? And are we renewing our customers? Is there a push or is there a pull to go upmarket? Are more enterprise logos coming inbound wanting to understand how we can solve problems for them versus us pushing our way upmarket. By the way, I've done both. There isn't a right or wrong there, but I think it's much easier if there's a pull versus a push. And I think it starts for me with always, like, research, which it's like understanding our current customers. Why did they buy? What would keep them to continue to renew with us? What do they wish we had? You know, those companies are also growing in size. And then it's also again, we're a research based company, so we've done this. We've actually researched large enterprise organizations asking what would it take to become a customer, what is the product need to have, etcetera. Right? And so we sort of have, like, a basis to go off of. And then more internally, it's do we have the team and talent that can actually perform enterprise sales motion? Do we have people that we could teach? Do we have people that are tenure that have done it at other organizations that can help up level the rest of the org? And then I look at process. Right? So what is our current process today if we've started in more SMB transactional motion? Comments before, like, sure. We can do the identifying pain and, like, here's the three things we solve, but do we have a process where we can actually up level conversations and go to enterprise logo, VPs of product, and sound like we know what we're talking about. Right? And that we understand their unique problems by industry. Do we sound like we know, you know, we're the leader in the market? And then I think it's all of the other things like, do we have the cross functional support to help us go upmarket, right, internally, those processes? Do we have marketing that can help us execute on ABX strategies? Do we have sales engineers that can do more technical level demos? Do we have value consultants that can create sort of those ROI calculators and business value reports that we need to sell to the CFO? And are we priced in a way that would make sense? Is it easy to do business with? Right? Are we flexible and agile to do a land and expand, or do we need to do a proof of concept, or can we do an enterprise license agreement? So I sort of go through those seven evaluations to determine whether or not we're gonna be successful. And, ultimately, if you have those things in place, I think you're ready to sort of go for it. Jess, we both know it doesn't work. We do. That's when you go to a board meeting and the board says, you know what we really should consider doing? Let's go up market. So, Jess, next quarter, can you please show us some momentum going up market? That does not work. That does not work. No. And that this is where this comes in really handy because you take this to the board and you say, look at all of the, like, seven things I've evaluated that suggest we are not ready yet. Let's continue to win focus. Let's win SMB. Let's win mid market before we feel confident that we can go up market because we've both been there, Mark. You lose one large enterprise logo and you can sink the whole ship. Right? You put all these resources, product resources, company resources, and focus into winning one one large logo, you're sunk. Yeah. And the pressure gets to be why aren't we performing in enterprise like we are in SMB or mid market when it's a completely different animal? I had my VP of enterprise. His name was Chris Albrell. He used to say this all the time. Like, the company has to have an enterprise state of mind. Everybody from the SDR and the support person all the way up to the CEO has to be thinking, how do I help us win the enterprise? And if it's just the sales team, the sales team will fail. Like, 100%, they will fail. It has to be marketing, product, legal, everybody ready to make some sacrifices and do some hard work because, otherwise, you're just gonna go back in the boardroom the next quarter, and they're gonna be like, why aren't you upmarket yet? And you're just gonna be like, I don't know why, but you do know why. It's just you're on an island trying to figure it out by yourself. Yeah. I couldn't agree more with that. I mean, I certainly saw that in scaling SalesLoft, and I know you saw it scaling Outreach, but we called it being enterprise y. How enterprise y can we be? And exactly right. Winning the enterprise is a company feat. It's not a sales feat. Boom. Well, Jess, this was outstanding. We talked deal reviews. We talked working with product. We talked discovery. And, unfortunately, we have to move to the final question. So the final question is we've talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit. Let's talk about a bad one. What is one bad habit that every sales leader in the world should break today to make the whole world a little bit better? There are a lot of bad habits, but I think one of my biggest bad habits is prioritizing other people, the cross functional partners initiatives over my own to seem more collaborative. I think there is a certain part where you have to take ownership of what's going to move your organization or your direct reports forward. I'm certainly all about collaboration, but sometimes you have to prioritize what you need to get done over helping others get what they need to get done. Well, just the last thing I'll leave the audience with is CHRO came into the fireside chat with our team once, and they said they're two of the most successful types of people at this company. Type number one is the people that help people, and then type number two is the people that also help people. And one of them will be the most massively successful group of people, and the other will likely fail at this company. And it's all about who are the types of people that you are helping because you cannot solve every single problem for the organization, and you need to pick the types of problem and the people that you're gonna help at your company. So I totally agree with you. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers.

Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alrighty, Mark. What'd you think? Listen. I think Jess is one of those sales leaders that has a bag of tricks, and I think she's constantly adding to that bag of tricks. And she pulls them out for specific situations and has a very thoughtful approach of how to do the very complicated thing of pulling a bunch of people together into an org that have a bunch of departments surrounding them and get everybody kinda move together as one. Yeah. It's one of those things that I think I struggled with a decent amount and I learned later on of, you know, trying to do anything on your own as a sales organization doesn't work. A lot of people will say, oh, sales has all this power because you get to choose the customers. And the reality is, like, no. You don't. You can sign the wrong customers. You can put reps in a segment with no product support. You can put reps in position where they're signing deals, and they all churn in customer success's hands. And so if everyone's not rowing in the same direction, it's totally one of those things that's gonna be a massive ulcer, and sales is actually gonna be a thorn in the side of the organization even though you're trying to fight a good fight for your own team. Yep. Alrighty, folks. Well, everyone go connect with Jess on LinkedIn and hang on for the next episode on The Leadership Show. Cheers.
