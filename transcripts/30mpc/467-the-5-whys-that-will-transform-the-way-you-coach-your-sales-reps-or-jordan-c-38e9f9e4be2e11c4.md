## Transcript

So, Mark, I feel like you're discounting and you're asking for approvals for discounts quite often. Why do you feel like that is the tactic that you're using to get these deals across the line? I think most enterprise buyers expect a discount. And when I show up and just do list price, the first thing they ask is what is the discount. So I'm just kinda, like, trying to jump ahead of this shit. Maybe tell me why you think that that is their initial reaction when you get to a pricing conversation. I'm not sure. I think they come in like this gonna be expensive, and I'm gonna drill you down. Why do they feel that it's expensive relative to maybe the value that you've expressed to them? It probably because I'm not creating enough value that to justify the price and so there's a price value mismatch. Why do you think it's getting to that point? Maybe I'm not finding the right problem or articulating the solution in the right way. Why you think the reason for that is? I probably am not talking either to the right people or getting to the right pains. So it sounds like we may be having some challenges identifying potential champions and understanding how they see value. That was a super cool experience for me as a person. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to president's club. I'm live in studio with my coach, Mark Cosclo, and the one and only Jordan Chavez. If you're not familiar with him, he put on two of the greatest leadership episodes we've had in the past. He is a three time president's club member when he was previously leading teams over at Nivan. He's now building the enterprise go to market motion at actively AI. And also previously at Nivan going in reverse order, he got eight promotions in six years. That's like 1.75 or something like that per year. I'm not in finance. I'm in sales. Mark, why should people listen? There's one thing that matters in sales leadership more than anything else, coaching. And I think we got so deep into coaching today of how to find root causes, create plans to help people get better, and make them feel comfortable doing it. I think it's an amazing episode. And the three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, Jordan. Welcome back to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. Number one, motivation mapping. During the interview process, during onboarding, and ultimately and continue with one on ones and quarterly check ins, you're going to wanna really diagnose what are the motivators. There's a primary motivator and usually a secondary motivator that might change over time. They live in four categories typically, growth, autonomy, recognition, and money. Now at the end of the day, secondary one will change. So you wanna understand what is their why. Someone coming on board to simply make the biggest paycheck that they can, they don't care about being recognized, they don't care about growing into the organization, or there may be someone who cares deeply about recognition, and, ultimately, money is a secondary motivator for them. I'm motivated deeply by your second takeaway. What is it? Number two, performance development plans. These are PDPs, not PIPs. So make it very clear to the rep when you're setting this setting this meeting, typically one hour, one on one at the very beginning of each each quarter, that this is to help them grow the through their skill set, not to inspect their past performance in a way that might, you know, make them feel like they're gonna be on a plan. So, ultimately, one hour, you're gonna set expectations that they should look at this across four key skills, potentially pipeline generation, deal execution, multithreading, whatever those key categories are. You're gonna rate it from one to four, thriving, performing, underperforming, or failing. Often, people are gonna be failing at certain skills when they're very early in their role. That's okay. We're gonna create a plan to really get to the root cause of any gaps that exist, create one or two actionable items that they can focus on on a weekly basis, and that's gonna be your check-in for the rep every weekly one on one to see where we're tracking against these these, tactical takeaways. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive goes to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Boom. What's number three? Number three, getting to the root cause of those skill gaps. This plays into into the PDP, but, ultimately, we're going to use a five why framework. Why's will pinpoint really where a rep is potentially struggling. They may see that as the gap itself. We know different. We know that there is going to be a root cause that we need to get to. So we're gonna ask why is this happening and then keep going deeper until we get to that root cause. So an example of this may be, hey. We see a low conversion from stage one to stage two. Why is that the case? The rep may be lacking confidence. Why is that the case? They are afraid to push back against this prospect. Well, why is that the case? Maybe they don't feel super confident in themselves pushing back. Well, why is that the case? Their preparation just was not up to snuff and they didn't have that going in. So ultimately, what we're doing is creating this growth map to understand, hey. These root causes, we can actually treat the root cause, not the symptom. I I love this five why thing. I think that what it does is it creates a intellectual, honest conversation, and there's some science behind it. You can only ask somebody why five times before they lose the ability to continue to lie because the lie gets so deep that they can't just keep going. But I'm interested as you're doing the whys, you're not just saying why is that the case five times in a row. Help me, like like, maybe we should do a quick role play. Mhmm. Like, make me your rep. Pick it. Like, five why me, man. Like So let's assume that for Mark, poor Mark wins. Discounting too much. Okay. Mark is discounting too much. I'm maybe a discounter. No. I'm not. So, Mark, I feel like you're discounting and you're asking for approvals for discounts quite often. You know, I'd be curious. Why do you feel like that is, you know, the tactic that you're using to get these deals across the line? I think most enterprise buyers expect a discount. And when I show up and just do list price, the first thing they ask is what is the discount? So I'm just kinda like trying to jump ahead of the ship. Okay. Maybe tell me why you think that that is their initial reaction when you get to a pricing conversation. I'm not sure. I think, you know, their think is probably too expensive. I mean, I think that's how they they come in. Like, there's gonna be expensive, and I'm gonna drill you down. Okay. Why do they feel that it's expensive relative to maybe the value that you've expressed to them? It probably because I'm not creating enough value that to justify the price, and so there's a price value mismatch. Mismatch. Okay. So during that value conversation, why do you think it's getting to that point? Maybe I'm not finding the right problem or articulating the solution in the right way that helps them understand, like, how much actual value there is there. And what do you think the, you know, reason for that is? I probably am not talking either to the right people or getting to the right pains. Okay. So it sounds like we may be having some challenges identifying potential champions and understanding how they see value. So let me let's just drop out of the role play for a second. I'm gonna just tell you what just happened to me. That was a super cool experience for me as a person. Like, because what I had to do is every time I would get asked why, I had to dig. I had to actually come up with a reason. I had to think about what was going on. And while this was a role play and I was making it up, I was trying to actually think about certain situations I've been in. And I think what I enjoyed the most about it is I think I was starting to self diagnose. Mhmm. You were helping me Yeah. See how do I get down to the root cause myself. And I felt like when you said your wrap up, so what I'm hearing is, I was like, yes. That's exactly what I was hearing, but I felt like I understood that already because of the process. I thought that was awesome. Yeah. I think it's challenging. Right? And it's easy to say, oh, well, why? Why? Why? That could be very people get on the defensive. Right? You wanna create that psychological safety where people can really go down that path together. Right? You wanna lean in and feel vulnerable. And I think, you know, whether it be setting expectation or sharing my own experience as a leader, gets reps to feel more comfortable going into that kind of experiment together. It really does. They need to lead themselves to water. You can't lead them yourself. What did you hear about his why questions? Like, as you like, did you notice a pattern, or do you notice, like, what he was doing as he was asking those? It it was very nonantagonistic. No. In the tone. It wasn't like, why are you doing that? It was like, why do you think the prospect feels that way? It was like you both trying to solve the problem together as opposed to why do you do that. Yeah. Right? And I think that's one way you can make your rep feel less defensive around them is it didn't feel like you were trying to figure out what Mark did wrong. You're trying to understand the intent behind why he did certain things. And I think the other thing that this exercise gives you the opportunity to do is there was a point where you had asked Mark, okay. Why do you feel like they're asking for a discount in the first place? And Mark said, oh, it's because they don't see the value or it's too expensive. And you might be able to challenge the why at that point by saying, what if it was actually the prospect just wanted a good deal. And you can start to reframe how a rep is thinking. When you ask them these why questions, you understand what's going through Mark's head, and then you can dig into the root cause of, like, why a rep made a certain decision, and then you can help them, like, see prospect interactions in a different way. Yeah. And you don't do that if you just say, instead of discounting, do this instead. Yep. I think what was interesting to me was why questions by their nature are aggressive. Why is your conversion rate bad? Now I get set into a defensive mode. I think what you did awesome and demonstrated was instead of making an aggressive why question, it was, well, why do you think that way? You what you're asking me is, like, what is Mark, what is your expert opinion on what they you think was going on with them that made you do that, which felt very not threatening. And so, you know, the other thing you could do is five whys is the question, but really what it is is digging deep. How and what questions are viewed as much less aggressive than why questions? How do you think you're doing it now? Right? And so I think what you really demonstrated was you can ask why questions in a nonaggressive way that feels collaborative versus accusatory. I think one of the biggest things that can be a challenge for people is we lie to others, but we also lie to ourselves. Right? And so I'm not saying that you're lying to yourself in that, but what we are trying to investigate is, is there something that I have control over that I can change that will actually impact this outcome? What are other ways where you prevent your reps from getting defensive? Or how do you know when your rep is even in, like, the mode where they're, like, open to hearing the feedback from you? It's really interesting. So I think of it almost as an anecdote. So there's this concept of seller deficit disorder. Right? You don't know me. You don't know my business, and you don't listen. So I think as a manager, there may be this kind of concept of manager deficit disorder. Hey, manager. You're not on the front lines with me. You're not on these calls. You're not the one who is getting these objections, so you don't necessarily understand me and what I am dealing with. So I think the first step is really just to to the point of leveling with the person. Hey. I kind of I understand what you're feeling. I was in your shoes. Obviously, you wanna show up and be in their shoes, be a part of their you know, copiloting them on these deals to really help them diagnose these things. But, again, I think it's being vulnerable. It's telling them when you don't know things, telling them, hey. I understand where you're coming from, but we need to think about this in a different way. Lead have the person lead themselves there as opposed to you doing it yourself. You both have stepped into brand new revenue organizations or sales teams where all of your reps are looking at you. And they're like, does this guy, like, know what he's talking about? He doesn't know my business. Why is he posting on LinkedIn? What's the nonsense he's putting out there? And you get the sense that there are certain reps who are very eager to be coached, but then there are other reps who feel like you need to earn their respect first. And I'm curious, like, how do you go about approaching those reps? Understanding what is most important to them. Break bread. You know? As as as kind of cheesy as that might sound, like, really getting to know the person. Because I think there is and I believe someone who was recently on the podcast talked about this. Right? Mask on versus mask off. I don't wanna be someone different at work than I am at home. And I think that level of vulnerability, whether or not people believe in your ability to coach them to run a deal cycle with the level of efficacy that they would expect or, you know, or believe that they should have. I think, ultimately, that trust goes a long way in saying, hey. We're gonna figure this out together. I understand you may not trust me fully, but I'm gonna prove it to you in how I show up, in how I am listening and taking your feedback just as much as I expect you to take mine. So I think it's always a two way street. Right? And so I that respect comes from obviously how you've done it before, but it also is how you continuously improve and and even give yourself coaching and show the rep what you're what you're trying to improve as well. I think a lot of sales leaders approach it as people respect me. I always approach it as I have no respect in this room. And I think my job is to build, and we talk about this a lot street cred. And so to me, there's a difference between coaching and modeling. And a lot of people can coach and tell you what to do. Right? But who can actually step into the call and actually do it? And I would say in the beginning, when you're trying to build that street cred and that stuff that lets you really coach, you should be more modeling than coaching. Model first, then coach. Then after that, you can start to coach and then model. But when you when people see like, you know, and I don't wanna make it seem like I'm the best discovery person on the world, but I'm pretty good at discovery. And when people see me to discovery, guess what? I earn the right to coach them on it. And when I they see how I deal with an objection, I earn the right to coach them on it. And so I would encourage sales leaders in the beginning. You gotta get that street cred. The only way to get the street cred is the model of the stuff that you're gonna coach that gives you access to the coaching. Where a lot of sales leaders screw up is they come in and they take bull in a China shop approach. And what they do is they're like, this isn't how I used to do it. It must be wrong. And not only do they just come in and say, this is how we should do it. They discount everything that the team has already done, and that's oftentimes another place where you lose respect is you haven't acknowledged anything that the team is doing well today. You're just assuming that it's all done incorrectly, and that's or the definition of, like, how you get a knee jerk reaction from your team. One of the things that you said about this, personal development plan that I I immediately had a reaction to. I don't know if it's good or bad, but, like, I sat up was we let the reps tell us what they need help with. Yep. So does this five why stuff help a rep identify what's in that plan? Like, help me understand your thinking around why you would let a rep tell you what they need work with versus you showing them data that says this is what you do need help with. Yeah. So there's two pieces to it. One, the rep should come with preparation across those categories of where do I think my gaps are. I'm gonna be doing the same exercise. We're gonna compare notes. So first, I get to kind of understand how do they see themselves? What are they reflecting on? Did they just kind of say, oh, I'm not hitting this quota or I'm not doing x? How deep did they really think about this? That gives me an indicator Oh, yeah. How invested they are in their own success. Right? Beyond that, I'm not expecting them to get to the root cause. That is an exercise that we have to go through together because, again, most people are going to say this is what's happening and they believe that there are either things that are outside of their control that are causing that to happen or maybe they just need to be better about time management. So the whole point of the PDP is to, again, create space for people to be vulnerable. Setting expectation. This is not a way for us to performance manage you out of the business or put you on a PIP that is going to then, you know, make it so that you can either be successful here or not, they should know where they stand at any given time. And if a rep doesn't feel like they know where they stand within the organization, I need to make that clear, and that's a miss on my part as a leader. And so I set the framework of what are the four key areas of skills that a rep needs to have. If it is, an environment where a full cycle AE, prospecting is one. Deal execution and discovery is another. Maybe a post sale account management is another aspect of their role. So we're going to predefine what those categories are and even create a, an abacus of what lives within those. Right? Gives them some examples to think through so that they can self identify that. I'm not expecting them to be able to know what I would look for in, you know, a a gap or or a skill gap. So there's a little bit of hand holding that might go on in preparation for this to give them a little bit of a priming of where you see these potential gaps, but I do want them to ensure that they are doing that reflection themselves. One of the things I see, that is the biggest barrier of change is pushing too much change down the throats of reps. So I got my PDP, but I'm sure you're also running org level trainings. How do you think about balancing, hey. This is something we're doing for everybody versus this is what we're doing for you. Is that is the thing that you're doing for everybody part of the PDP too? And when is it all inclusive? Or how are you managing to make sure you're not just overwhelming people with coaching? Yeah. Well, and over overwhelming yourself as well. Right? If I'm managing six, eight reps, there's a lot of different areas depending on their tenure, depending on what their background is of where they can improve. So what I wanna try and do is understand where are the themes, where are the broad themes. Are we as an entire team missing on discovery? Do we need to get better at identifying and potentially testing champions? That's something that will then inform how I create enablement and do this at a team level. If there's something that I see that a rep could really improve on that the rest of the team could, I might even say, hey. You should teach this to the team. I wanna empower you if that's something that you care about. You wanna grow. You wanna become a leader someday. There's ways to scale that as opposed to me just, you know, beating that drum to every single member of the team. Interaction and taking ownership over their own development is super critical. I want you to imagine the face of one of your reps either in the past that you know has struggled with discovery. And they come in, they're like, hey. I think I'm underperforming at discovery. How do you go about figuring out what the root cause is or diagnosing where you should focus your attention on discovery? Yeah. It's a great question. It all starts with the five whys, but doesn't just end there. I think there is a gut feeling that you will end up getting to as a leader of knowing, okay. This person clearly can identify once we get down to that root cause. It's kind of this moment of, oh, wow. I I do understand that maybe I am targeting a different a wrong persona or asking this person only surface level questions and not getting to that second and third level pain. It's a it's a dance. Right? You want to get someone to, really tell you and get to that root cause through those five whys, but a lot of these things are interwoven. So what do I mean by that? I had a rep once who was very, very good at prospecting. She was incredible at getting meetings through, you know, cold calls, emails, LinkedIn, really omnichannel. What we ended up identifying was that her conversion rates from kind of the scope stage into more vendor of choice were completely falling off, and she was not hitting her quota. So if I were to just say, well, you're not very good at executing a go no go meeting or, you know, creating a business case. We could have diagnosed the wrong thing. What we ended up identifying through kind of five whys getting deeper into why was she targeting this person, why was this persona not getting her to where she needed to go, ultimately, she was scared of having a conversation with the CFO. She had this kind of fear of messing up in such a high stakes environment. So I needed to create, you know, a a a structure with her that allowed her to say, hey. It's okay to fail in some of these situations, but we're gonna continuously get better and talk about let's up level your conversation to a c level conversation as opposed to speaking to people who you feel comfortable speaking to that might be more below the line. What are the other, like, coaching rhythms you have with your team? Are you doing I know you've used AI for call reviews in the past. I think we talked about how you've reviews calls in the past or deals in the past in a previous episode. Like, where are the different points where you're, like, inserting yourself as a coach in your business on a weekly basis? I think having a structured operating cadence is important. We have talked about that in the past of knowing and creating expectations of where you will be inspecting, where you will be open to people getting feedback from you, having people really get you involved in deals. Frankly, I think the best way to do it is just to be in the boat. Right? And that's where you there's this concept of futsal. Right? So soccer, obviously, football for anyone, international is played on a massive pitch. You have 11 players right on each side and the stakes are very high, let's say, in that in that environment. You're not gonna learn as much because the feedback loop may be elongated. Right? Because the time it takes for me to kick a ball from here down to the 30 yard box is gonna be very different. If I'm in a futsal environment, it's a lot of short passing. It's very small tactical, you know, movements, a lot of small passes, and there's a lot more feedback. Yeah. Small field. There's a lot more feedback that you're getting instantly. And so I think of this as almost like a futsal environment where if there's ways in which I can create these very quick feedback loops, it allows me to not have to go weeks or months without understanding or diagnosing something that could have been changed a lot a lot earlier. So what does that look like? Is it just you having your reps invite you on every call that they're on? Is it you doing weekly call reviews? Like, how does that actually play out? Yeah. I think it it it it can depend on where the rep is in their development. So let's say there's someone who is having a lot of trouble in landing a cold call. And, you know, again, we could say, well, maybe it's your call volume, maybe it's these other things, but ultimately it doesn't replace the fact that I might need to sit on a call with them or sit next to them. And the second they land a cold call and deliver that pitch and it doesn't convert to a meeting, we have quick feedback. Right? They give me, hey. What did I do well? Where could I improve? I do the same thing, and then we do it over and over again. What I often do for role plays is you do the same role play three times. So we do a role play first. You show me what you're doing. You know, we maybe we are role playing a discovery call. We'll do it for two minutes. We'll pause, give quick feedback, and we'll do it again. We'll pause. We'll do give quick feedback, and we'll do it a third time. And by the third time, you're pretty much ready to go and actually be out in the wild and do it, and you feel that confidence. I think the repetition early is really critical. How do you look at progression in all this? I got my spreadsheet. It's got my last six quarters. How do you like, they're not gonna do good at everything. Like, what is your expectations? How do you teach your managers and people like that to make sure that they have the right expectations for what this is gonna do? Because you just because you write down the sheet doesn't mean that's gonna magically happen. It relates to to goal setting in some ways. Right? So you're breaking down a larger incentive into smaller chunks so that people can really digest it. So whatever that goal is, their skills, we know what we need to teach them to get to that next level. If it's going to be a higher level segment that they're operating in, if it's going to be a management role that they're going to take on, it's a map. Right? So it's not necessarily I am it's not a scorecard on a daily basis. Yeah. So we don't need to get so deep into this, but we should have a feeling of where someone is developing. And if they're not developing towards a certain skill, it's it's it's an early indicator that there's something that is holding them back either from a skill perspective or a will perspective. So both of you guys are big on practicing, not just waiting for the next time a rep runs into the competitor 17 objection next year to practice. And so I'm curious, Jordan, when you're doing role plays with your reps, could you give an example of how you set it up and how you run an effective sales role play? Yeah. So there's a few different ways, and it really depends on what you're you're trying to role play. But I think let's use discovery as a good example. We're gonna create a time bound environment. So we're gonna say, hey. We only are doing this for five minutes. I want them to bring a real example with me. We'll have other reps involved as well. Again, set the expectation that this is a safe place. We are going to fail over and over and over until we improve and and get it right. I will often start myself as the account executive and show them how it's done first and foremost. Have them give me feedback. Give them give myself feedback, and then we'll let someone else go. And we'll continuously do that over and over. So what I mean by that is, again, we'll have a rep say, we're gonna do discovery for this five minutes. We're gonna stop and give feedback to you. You're gonna give a self reflection, and then we're gonna do it over again. And then we're gonna do it over again. And then we're gonna do it a third time. Hey, dude. A sports analogy, but do you think Jalen Brunson only does a step back three in the middle of a game? Yeah. Of course not. Yeah. Right? So there's it's obviously a very high leverage activity that he is doing, and it's incredibly you know, the skills involved are very, very challenging, but he's done that thousands, if not tens of thousands of times prior to doing that in the game. There's two big concepts. The one is usually the way a rep does something the first time is how they'll do it forever. Mhmm. And so you got to get in into change behavior mode because they're locked in. And the second thing is is most reps confuse comfort with success. I'm good at my demos because I'm comfortable in how I do them. They don't look at what is the actual output of those demos, and so we have to help reps understand, listen. Lots of times you get locked in in the first way you do it. You get you do it. And then because you're comfortable with it, you think it works. So we have to do that. And like you just saw I just did with Jordan. I'm a big well, let's just role play. Yeah. If we're talking about a problem, let's do it right now. And here's the again, the model versus the coach. I will if I feel like I have the right relationship, I'll be like, hey, let's do this, and I'll take on the buyer. You're the seller. We'll role play you. But if I don't have a great relationship, I'll be like, you know what? We're gonna role play, but I'm gonna be the seller. You're gonna be the buyer, and I'll model what I want them to do. Yeah. And I think that that's just like you gotta get used to just, like, pop and role plays on people all the time, all the every day. That is a cultural thing. And once it gets used to it, then you'll walk down your sales floor, and you'll see two reps doing it to themselves because it's part of the culture. Jordan, amazing show. We have to move to the final question. We talked about a lot of good coaching habits that leaders can exhibit. What is one bad coaching habit that every leader should break so that all teams get a little bit better? Make it in about themselves and not about the rep. Mhmm. Typically, people want to feel like they have something to deliver. They wanna give, their own feedback. They wanna make themselves feel good, but, really, it's not about you. It is about the rep themselves. So it's easy to say, hey. I'm gonna tell you this, and it's gonna make me feel like I've done my job. But, ultimately, if it doesn't land, if it doesn't actually resonate, and if it doesn't actually feel authentic to that person, it's not gonna improve anyone's skill set. So, ultimately, you've gotta make sure that you are understanding, you know, how they receive feedback to make it land. In Chris Voss's words, you need to be looking for that's right, not your right. Yes. And if you coach the rep the the way that they needed to be coached, you hear that's right. Yep. Dude, amazing show. Everyone hang up for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Oh, and we have some Easter egg questions at the end, so don't fully hang up. Alrighty, Mark. Time for a two by two recap from this episode with Jordan Chavez. What do you have for your two? Gotta love my five whys. That's number one. In discovery, if you don't get the second and third level pain, you don't get a deal. And guess what? If you don't get the root cause in coaching, you don't get change. So you gotta use those five wise to get deep to find root cause. And then the second thing that I really like that you're doing, the way you do the wise. It's not just about doing them. It's how you do them and making me go on a journey of self discovery that you're guiding me on, not a journey of you pounding me with everything I'm doing wrong so that I feel like crap afterwards. Number three, the quarterly PDP. That rhymes. So you wanna map out the top four categories that matter for your business. Maybe it's prospecting, discovery, deal execution, and upsell. And then you wanna have your reps rate themselves on one four scale in each area. And that will give you the first place where you can start doing the five whys and diagnosing the root cause. From there, you wanna identify a clear KPI for each gap and one to two weekly actions for them to go and solve that gap. And then lastly, number four, if one of those gaps is discovery, the best thing you can do is role play a lot. So set up the situation and don't role play it once and then forget about it. Go role play it five, ten, 15 times. And Mark gave some great advice on if you don't have trust with that rep yet, you do it first. Show that you can get in game. Folks, if you liked this one, this reminded me a lot of a newsletter and an episode that Kevin Dorsey was on, KD, where he talked about the importance of practice in the way that he runs his one on one. So he broke down his entire one on one formula and how he runs practice role plays in a step by step newsletter. So go check that one out in the show notes. And everyone, we will see you on the next one. Rapid fire. Number one. What's the number one hiring mistake a sales manager can make? Not treating their candidate pipeline like a sales pipeline. People are not always ready to buy. They will not always be the ready to jump even though they may be a perfect candidate. They may be an a player. You wanna maintain that relationship over time for when it is right for them, and, ultimately, you need to nurture. Number two. What's the number one sales interview question you can ask a rep? Arman, based on this conversation, what do you think I think of you? Oh, somebody's done that a few times. Yeah. What do you get out of it? Gets people kinda taken aback just like you did. Right? What I want people to understand or to express to me is how they can actually get emotional intelligence across. They are gonna sense what I'm giving in the interview. They're going to sense how I am responding or what questions I'm asking, and I want them to be able to quickly diagnose that for me. If I'm an SDR and I wanna get promoted to AE, what are you looking for? When a lot gets thrown on your plate, when you have way too many tasks, way too many enablement sessions, all these things that your managers and other people are asking of you, do you still fall back on these processes that are going to make sure that you're successful and hit your hit your numbers, hit your KPIs? The AE role is your role times three. Right? And so what I need to know is that you can rely on these kind of processes and this foundation to continue to be Lastly, what is the number one thing that makes a great sales leader? Showing up. There's many ways to show up. So it's just as much the way you show up, but you gotta do it consistently, continuously, and with oftentimes a smile on your face when you may not feel it, people will notice. And I think showing up is 90% of the battle. What does that look like? What does that look like? Being available for reps when they need it, showing up by asking them how are they doing, really being prepared for every single interaction that you're asking them to be prepared for as well. So it's showing and, you know, practicing what you preach. Boom. That's a wrap.
