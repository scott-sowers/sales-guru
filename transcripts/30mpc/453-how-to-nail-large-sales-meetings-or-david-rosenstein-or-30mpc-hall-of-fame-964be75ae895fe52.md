## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have someone who didn't just make Presidents Club. This man made Club One. Club One is not the top 10%, not the top 5%. The top 1% of all sellers at LinkedIn. 50 people got this award of an org of over 1,000 sales reps. It is the one and only David Rosenstein. He is a top 1% AE over at LinkedIn. One of the most tactical episodes episodes we have ever had, and we are so grateful because he is also a club coach as part of the thirty minutes to president's club club pass program. Nick, why should people listen? We got into something that we've never really talked about ever on thirty MPC, which is reframing your weaknesses into strengths. There's oftentimes that there's just stuff that our product or our company can't do. We don't have a certain feature that a competitor has. Our deal structure is three years, and they want one year. They want a trial. We can't do it. They want this integration. We don't have it. And oftentimes, those weaknesses are what cause us to lose to competitors. David gets into how he reframes any weakness that he has into a strength, and we got into a ton of examples for how you can reframe. And then in the back half of this, we talked about some of his best practices for getting to power in multithreading. Frankly, some stuff we also haven't talked about on the show. So I I came away with a ton of notes that we're gonna be using to sell here at 30 MPC, and so let's get into this thing. In three, two, one. Let's roll. Alright, David. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get yours. Hey. Thanks, Nick and Armand. An honor to be here. Tip number one, have a fortunately mindset. When I was a tour guide, I used to get people asking me all the time at University of Maryland, hey. Are we gonna be able to see a residence hall, a dorm room? And some people go, yeah. You know, unfortunately, we're not gonna be able to show you that. That's super disappointing for them. So instead, reframe. Hey. Fortunately for you, we're not gonna be walking you down a narrow hallway, exposing you to students that just showered. So fortunately, we have a model room in the Residence Hall Visitor Center where you can see an example of what this looks like. Here's how to do that as an AE. Hey. Why can't I just purchase this online? Why do I have to go through you? Hey. Yeah. We used to have that set up where you could just get it yourself, but people were requesting a lot of refunds. So fortunately, we're here to make sure that you can get exactly what you need and not pay a penny more. Beautiful. What's number two? Number two. Breadcrumb your way to power using Hansel and Gretel. Don't surprise your buyers in the last five minutes by encouraging them to bring the DM onto the call only for them to go, yeah, you know, I'll bring it back myself. Number one, find the DM names before the call using sales navigator. Step two, confirm the names throughout. Hey. When you were discussing this issue internally and you report to Mark. Right? Awesome. So walk me through what prompted that conversation. And then step three, tease the next step in the middle of the call. Hey. And next time we chat with Mark, Jane, and Simon, we're gonna walk you all through how your competitors are currently winning talent without using headhunters. But I'm curious how you're currently dot dot dot. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work in prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. So good. Round us out, David. What's number three? Tip number three, be a calendar hero. Make your prospect's life easier by including other DMs onto the call for them. In my experience, 20% of the time will actually have them forward the calendar invite. So instead use this talk track. Hey, Sarah. To save you the admin step, I'll go ahead and add Sarah and James to the calendar invite. Do their emails follow the same structure as yours? Firstname@company.com? Thanks. And you know what would actually be super helpful? Do you mind giving them a heads up that I'll be sending them over so you don't think I'm a total spammer? David, that first one, dangerous. There are so many sellers that screw up when they get an objection. Do you do this integration? And they're just like, no. Unfortunately, we don't have that integration. And it's a missed opportunity because oftentimes, that's an intentional decision from your product team to not have that integration. So I was wondering if you could give us maybe one or two examples of common objections you'll get or feature requests that you might not do at LinkedIn and how you would handle them instead. Absolutely. Number one, when HR teams wanna use our recruiting tools, hey. Do you have a free trial for the corporate recruiter tool? Some folks go, no. We don't. I'm so sorry. But instead, hey. So fortunately, we don't do a one month free trial because I'm curious. What is your average time to hire? Oh, it's forty five days? Yeah. So on average, folks, it typically takes between thirty to forty five days and adding in a week to learn the new tool, it's gonna take you a little bit of time before you actually see something enough to go to your exec. So what we do instead is a six month proof of concept program. It's more hands on. Fortunately for you, it's a little bit more support and hopefully you can make a few hires so you have a much more compelling story before you go to the CFO and ask for a huge chunk of change. Could you break down what you did there? Because you agreed with the objection for a second. You reframed it. Walk me through the steps of how I could do this myself. Sure. So step one, hey. Do you do a free month trial? Every time you get a question, there's always, like, a question behind the question. So one thing you'd wanna do is there must be a reason why you're asking that question. Step one. Step two, I did a little bit more discovery in a really close ended way to make sure that there was more conversational ping pong while I was also still answering the question. Hey. What is your average time to hire? Okay. Forty five days. So now I can go into an explanation that's grounded in their reality. Fortunately, for you, a, we've thought about it or, b, we used to do that. Fortunately for you, we've thought about it, but the reality is is you wouldn't be able to have the win stories. Fortunately for you, what's in it for them? Now you'll be able to have more of a compelling win story, and plus, it's a little bit more hands on. I might even throw in a cheeky. The problem is you are gonna be stuck with me for a little bit longer, and I realize that might be a downside. How do you draw the line between yeah. Fortunately, it takes nineteen months to implement our products. How do you draw the line between trying to paint everything as fortunately that's on purpose versus calling it out and leaning into it when you're like, hey. This isn't a strength in our product. Yeah. There are some things that you can't spin, and I don't have a politics or PR background. But there are gonna be some things that your product is not the best in. So the best thing that I always like to do before I go into an explanation, hey. Help me understand, like, what's so important about that, like, nineteen month period. It sounds like you need to get this up and running. Tell me more about it. And once you get a little bit more information, it'll help build trust if you totally fall on the sword. Hey. I totally get it. Sounds like this is a really important feature for you. Can I ask, is that a deal breaker? Is that the most important feature? As we're having this conversation, you mentioned x y z. Is that the most important? And if they say it's pretty high up there, then you might build a lot of trust by being like, we may not be the right vendor for you, and I'm happy to make other recommendations. But if that is the deal breaker, then maybe we might not be the best fit. And good for you for getting that out early rather than wondering why they ghosted you three steps later. I remember this happened at Carta where we were going head to head with a really old school equity management platform. So equity management platforms allow you to manage all of your stock options, your equity programs, etcetera. And there were some of these folks that had every form of compliance reporting you could possibly imagine. And the CFO was digging in, and I was struggling. And so what happened is my manager stepped in, and he was like, Dave, I just wanna call something out. Is that okay? He's I see the stage of company you're in. I know you're thinking about getting audited. Here are the four, five, or six types of reports that we can offer you. And then here is how other clients like you make the best use of those reports if they need a little bit more. I'm gonna be completely honest with you. If you go to Certain, you are going to have 10 times the amount of reports, and it's gonna be on a Google Doc page that is so overwhelming that you could literally click into every single report for the next seventeen hours and not look through every single one. If this is the most important thing for you, they're going to be the right product. But what I also know about you is every single week, three employees are exercising their options, and you're doing that stuff manually, and you would be doing it manually on certain too. And so I'm curious for you. If you think about those two buckets of best in breed, what each group is best at, what's actually the most important for you? And he was like, good answer. The exercises. And so sometimes it's okay to lean into the things that you were intentionally weak at in sales and your product instead of trying to defend that ground as well. Yeah. Arman, one there there's two things that I would call out from that story that you told that made what your manager did particularly effective. The first, it was actually a small thing. But before he went into that mini monologue to try to change the customer's mind, he did get permission. Hey. Do you mind if I share my thoughts on it? And we wanna do that anytime you're, like, coming pretty direct at them. But then if you think about the sequencing of how that information was shared, he led with the weakness first. And that bought him so much credibility to then be like, but this is why we're better and this is why you should go that option because that the option of us, which is what he was implying with that. Here's some things to consider here. And so those two little nuances, you can't just go into this, like, monologue of no, but this is why we're better than certain and then at the end be like, and then we're weaker because the customer is gonna be like, dude, what the hell? It's like a little too aggressive. So what he did there was very, very smart, Armand. What are some other times that this comes up, David? Yeah. Some other times this comes up is when I'm selling LinkedIn Learning, for example. A lot of people ask, hey. We also, as HR folks, need to run, compliance updates. We need to do harassment trainings. Do you also cover it? And the reality is is that is not something that we include in our platforms. Hell, even for us as internal employees, we use Cornerstone for our own internal compliance needs. And so I'll tell clients, hey. Sounds like compliance is really important to you. Talk me through how you're currently doing that. We'll get that information. The second thing I'll ask them is, hey. When we started this conversation, I just wanna make sure we're aligned. The thing we're looking to solve for is your previous learning providers. There hasn't been a lot of learner engagement. Is that still the most important metric here, or are we missing something else? No. That's still the most important. Great. Can I share a little bit about why we internally at LinkedIn use a separate learning provider instead of using LinkedIn learning for compliance? And then I'll go into, we've actually thought about it before. Fortunately, because we keep compliance separate, it it encourages us as employees to treat LinkedIn learning as an upskilling platform. It encourages us to go back to it and to not make it be seen as a must have, but make it seen as something we get to do. And so as a result, because you're looking to solve learner engagement, fortunately, that is exactly what LinkedIn Learning is designed for. It's not something people roll their eyes when they get the notification. Oh, boy. We gotta do this again. It's they're so sick of doing the seventeen secondurity trainings every single quarter. You don't want them being burnt out on the LinkedIn learning notifications. You want them excited about that. And so you want them to be separate. One is like the, okay. I gotta do this. The other ones are like, oh, this is exciting. I get to do this. That's the reframe that you're doing. Yeah? Bingo. Plus, I always fall for the phishing emails, so let's keep those away from LinkedIn learning as much as possible. Oh, man. How about contract term? Because I think this is one that gets a lot of sellers, especially those that sell software screwed up, where I always sold software that had a minimum three year term. And again and again and again, if we couldn't give them a free trial, then they wanted a one year agreement, and we just couldn't do that. So I'm curious how you would reframe a client pushing on something like that. Yeah. LinkedIn has made some pretty big changes internally to move folks away from 12 agreements. Because you're right, Nick. I mean, industry average in the HR tech space is around three to five years. And so for us, when people ask, can you do a twelve month contract? I'll mention a few things. Hey. Totally get that. And after doing a little bit of discovery, we used to offer twelve month contracts, and we found that clients that were on longer term agreements found more success and were able to make more hires. And so fortunately for you, instead of having to deal with these year over year negotiations, having to deal with annual price increases, you'll be locked into this year rate for either twenty four or thirty six months. And so now it's a little bit more powerful and a little bit more, hey. Fortunately, that's fortunately bad. But, of course, it's more of a conversation, and we don't wanna create something as rosy because buyers will see right through that. Putting these two different tactics together of using fortunately and also guiding them to the right way to buy the product, you can make it so that no matter where they land in your pricing options, you win. So, for example, one of the things we would do is we would present two pricing options, a one year deal and a two year deal or a three year deal. And what would happen is that one year deal, because it included the cost of implementation, the potential churn, the cost of getting them onboarded, all of that stuff, that was an initial really high amount. So let's call it a 150 k. But then you can make the two year option look really, really attractive by making it a two year deal that's 250 k that goes from $1.10 in the first year to $1.40 in the second year, which not only guarantees your org expansion dollars, but it also guarantees you long term retention while saving the prospect money year over year. And so you can steer your prospect in the right direction and make it as easy as possible for them to buy it the right way. It's sort of like if you, if you want the customers to buy the good stuff on your restaurant menu, you put it in like the favorites on the front page. But then if someone wants to do all this weird stuff where they want like the gnocchi with the grape sauce and then like the, the pork ragu on top of it. That's like the build your own in the bottom, like, appendix for the people who are allergic to Alfredo or something like that. Not the best example, but you guys get what I'm eating. Outing my dinner order, dude. Arman, remind me to visit your restaurant when you open one. Please do. Hilarious. So, David, if we take things to guiding the customers to the right way to buy, I wanna go to some of the things that you brought up in your actionable takeaways around teaching the customer basically how to get others in their org involved, AKA multithreading. This is something we've been running into with our new product at thirty MPC, our club pass program, where we're now selling to sales leaders. And we'll get in front of a sales manager who has eight reps underneath them, but we need to get to a director or a VP. And oftentimes, what's happening at the end of the call is, like, the managers, yeah, this thing looks great. I'm gonna circle up internally and get with our team, and I'll get back with you next week. And we're, like, good enough that we're pushing and well, we're we're pushing them to get a next step or a backstop on the books for the week following, but I'm sure there's more nuanced things we could be doing in the back half of that call. I guess I'm wondering what advice you might have for us. Yeah. It happens all the time, especially in the SMB space. So a few things. Number one, the biggest thing that you wanna do is make sure that people aren't leaning on deferred authority and going, oh, man. I really want this, only to go back to their leader and not even bring it up and then say, yeah. You know what? We talked it over. It just isn't in the cards. So first, before you even go down this rabbit hole, hey. If this decision was up to you and you alone, would this be something of interest? Would you move forward? Like, budget wasn't an option. How useful do you see this for you? Fortunately, I work with a lot of folks that used to use our recruiting tools at their prior companies. They join a new company, call LinkedIn, and they're like, let's get started. What do I do in that case? I work with a recruiter who's never gone through the buying process before. Step one, I might ask them, hey. Can you walk me through step by step the last time you've implemented a software at this company, either for a new user or the last one? If they can't, in step by step, walk through who was looped in and where, they don't know how things typically work. Hey. Can I bounce something off of you? If they don't know how things typically work, you're gonna have to teach them how to buy. And this is such an important, point that my mentor, Sam McKenna, taught me. So step one, during the call, you're gonna wanna explain why you're bringing in each person. So right before you're pitching, yeah, let's bring on James, Joanne, Steven, Susan, Martha, Anthony. Hey. Here's why we bring on these different perspectives. You're the recruiter. You're gonna be the one using the tools. And how many times do you get that objection? Up up up up up. Linda's not gonna be doing the recruiting. I'm gonna be doing the recruiting. Let me handle this. Hey, Linda. You're gonna be the one in the weeds. That's why I want your feedback on the day to day on the intuitiveness. Linda's the one who's having the most amount of conversations with Brady on the COO on what hiring forecast looks like. It also is gonna be helpful for James who's leading the sales team, who knows exactly what he's looking for. His input is gonna be helpful to make sure the people he wants are even on LinkedIn. So each of you are gonna play a very unique part so that at the end of the demo, you can say, hey. I hate this or this makes sense. Let's move forward. So step three, ask for more people and expect less. Hey. On the next call, Linda, we're gonna bring on James, John, Susan, Mark, Anthony, and Steve. And then you get, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. It's just me, James, and Susan that you need. So it's just like negotiations. Ask for more and be okay with less. But who knows? Best case scenario, you bring everyone on and then you gotta do a few warm up calls in the meantime to make sure you're not wasting anyone's time. Lastly, if they're like, you know what, David? You gotta go through me. Well, hey. Now it's a little bit of a give and get. I totally get it. Sounds like you think James is really busy and maybe it might not be super relevant to loop in. Or sounds like you're not fully bought bought in on whether or not this is what the team needs. If that's the case or if they're like, you know, they're just really busy. They asked me to own this. I totally get it. Why don't we do this? Let's go through a tour of the technology and make sure what you're seeing is hitting exactly on these challenges that we just summarized. And if it is, then would you feel comfortable advocating internally to bring them on for a pricing deep dive? So if I can do this for you and show you the tools, will you then return the favor and bring this person on? And if you get there and they're still not willing to do that, then you can do a gut check. Do you wanna continue working with this person? Have they earned the trust? Or do you wanna use that information, re prospect internally, and start the process all over again? David, what do you do if you're like, we gotta have your head of talent, your chief people officer, your head of talent operations. There's 17 cousins and everyone on the call, and they're like, sure. And it's boom. Now your calendar invite has 15 people on them, and it's actually a bigger room than you can control. What do you do in that situation? Absolutely. First of all, how exciting. This champion is so fired up. Let's make sure that we're maximizing that hour that we have together. So number one, you're gonna recap all of those challenges and you're gonna put it on a slide to start off the call. And you're gonna ask people very pointed perspectives. James, I know Jane mentioned this as the hiring forecast. Can you give your feedback there? Steven, you're in finance, and so can we walk through over the past year? How much have we spent on recruiting? A different targeted discovery question for every person at the beginning. Step two, you're not waiting until the call to engage with them. Sending them an email. Hey, James. It's super nice to meet you. I met with Lauren, and there's two things. Number one, do you have a second to really quickly answer these two questions? What are you hoping to get out of this call? What is the biggest issue around recruiting that you're hoping to solve for? Or number two, give them a cold call, Jane, or send them a LinkedIn message. Jane, I'm really excited to chat with you on Thursday to make this time as valuable as possible for you. Can you walk me through what would be helpful in bucket a, b, and c, whatever challenge you solve for? Under what circumstances, if ever, will you split up that room, or is your preference to get everyone all together all at once? It depends on the linearity of your sales cycle. Normally, I can keep a very tight disco demo close. The larger now that I'm working with mid market deals, though, I will choose to have different calls if everyone's all together. I might send out an email to be like, hey. Legal. I wanna isolate this conversation because your needs are very different than James, Joanne, and Steven's. They're already bought on board. They've already accepted the calendar invites. Now we'll move forward. But I'm not gonna go down that rabbit hole unless I've got an internal buy and confirm them that this is an issue. Once it exceeds four to five people, then I'll probably start going down there. The pre meeting cold call as you're calling it of, hey, Armand. I know you're on this meeting. Can we talk for five minutes before the meeting? Is so powerful. I see a lot of sellers who are like, well, you already have a meeting with them. That's kind of weird. Like, why would you call them? It's no. It's not. It's actually in their best interest to talk with you for five minutes. And now what happens is you go in the room and, one, you've already had the icebreaker of you're no longer this strange face that they're meeting for the first time. But, two, you've already sort of gotten some implicit agreement and engagement from that person, and you will see the room is so much warmer when you do that pre meeting call. And then on the backside of this, this is something that I would do all the time when we sold to law firms is we would have that big team meeting, and they throw a ton of attorneys in this room. And we'd have a room of 15 people. Oftentimes, Armand, to your point, I'd be meeting them for the first time, but it was more of, oh, the partners just wanna see the software. And so we wouldn't have that pre meeting conversation. But after, I would figure out who the outspoken people in the room were, and I would use the fact that we had just met with them. And as soon as we got off the demo, I would pick up the phone and I would call Sharon, the managing partner of the law firm who clearly had an interest in tech. And I'd be like, hey. I know we just got off this demo. Like, I wanted to hear what you thought and make sure I answered any questions for you because I got the sense you're probably one of the more tech tech forward attorneys. You wouldn't believe how sandwiching that meeting with multithreading just opens up an opportunity for you to run separate deep dives with the managing partner or the CEO. And, like, things just go so much further when you pick up the freaking phone and call these people who you're already meeting with. Nick, there's something else to highlight there. If this person is entrusting you to run a meeting with five, ten, 15 people, you gotta thank them. Yep. You gotta text them afterwards because they're putting their brand on the line. Mhmm. Hey, Sarah. How do you think that went? Sarah, thank you so much for organizing that. I'm sending you coffee. I'd love your feedback. How do conversations after I pushed end on the Zoom call? How how do you get your clients on a text basis, David? That's a good question. The secret to getting on a texting basis with someone is twofold. Number one, before, and number two, after. It's really helpful when you have a quick question that's fired off way faster than an email. Sarah, Sajanay hasn't accepted the calendar event. Is she joining? Just wanna prep. Really simple. And then afterwards, if you have led a really compelling demo, which if you're listening to this podcast, obviously, you are, then you have earned the right to text her and be like, Sarah, thanks. How do you think that went? I really wanna make sure I made you look good. So what I'm hearing from both of you to recap is there are a couple of things that are going on when you're going into this bigger team meeting. So one, you're initially making an ask for more people than you need to have on that call, and you're explaining why all of those people need to be involved. From there, you're working with your champion a ton to understand who's in the room, what they care about. And then you can do it one of two ways. You can either divvy up the room beforehand and go meet with those people one on one and then combine the room, or you can have all those people in the room together, but then you've gotta be really good on the upfront recap, sharpshoot each of the people in the room to make sure that you're asking them point of discovery questions, and then you can do breakouts afterwards. So it's sort of like the Power Rangers can be fighting separately and then unite, or you can start by Power Rangers unite, and then they can go fight the bad guys. So there are different ways that you can attack it. My last question for you on multithreading, David, is my understanding of how most recruiting organizations are structured is you have frontline recruiters who are actually working with the candidates. Then you have managers that manage multiple recruiters. Then you usually have directors of talent who might manage engineering recruiting or whatever it is, and then you have VPs of talent who oversee the whole thing. And then you have, like, talent operations, which would be like the equivalent of sales ops or rev ops. What level of altitude do you usually need to be at in the organization? Do you ever start with a recruiter? Is it the manager level? Like, how do you think about where you start in the org? Yeah. It's a great point. And for me, I will start by whoever the heck is willing to talk to me. The first thing I'm gonna do is if I get a VP of talent on the phone, you know I'm not gonna be asking them about the day to day minutiae of scheduling candidates with the hiring managers. Not at all. But at the same time, I am gonna ask them about executive level priorities, and I will tell them, hey. I think it'll probably be a good idea. I think there's a way we can help. I do also think it's a good idea for me to chat with a recruiter who's more so in the weeds and can speak to the actual day to day obstacles that they're facing, not just on the higher level business impact. And so I'm thinking I'll probably chat with James and Sarah, but I wanna ask you before we reconnect, how involved do you wanna be in that conversation? So I put the ball if I'm talking with an executive in their court. Sometimes they might say, I wanna be involved in that conversation, and then you got a really hands on exec. And that's great. Otherwise, they're like, you know what? Chat with them first. They know what they're doing. And then awesome. Let's all reconnect in a month once we've had those conversations, once I've been able to formulate what makes the most sense and collected more data. On the flip side, you got someone and you're starting from the bottom and you're working your way up, go with exactly the pathway that we talked in the beginning. You mentioned that when you are meeting with an executive, you are not talking about clicks and permissions and day to day processes. You were talking about executive level priorities. Could you give some examples of what executive level priorities sound like for the role that you are selling to? For me specifically, hey. It sounds like you're trying to hire fifteen, twenty people. I'm sure you're not just looking to hire people to fill up office space. Walk me through what is so important about these 15 or 20 people. What's going on in the business that's driving us to forecast this? If another question, hey. I'm sure there's a lot of people that reached out to you, and there must have been a very specific reason that you decided. You know what? Let's chat with David as opposed to the millions of other people begging for your time. Yeah. And, hey, I I have my own hypothesis, but I'd love to hear from you first what specifically is going on in the recruiting world where you're thinking LinkedIn might be able to help. That hiring one is so powerful because if you can figure out yeah. They're talking to you because they need to hire people. You're figuring out what do they need to hire hire people for. You sell a product to help with hiring, and so it'd be easy to be like, oh, I'm selling this product to talk about how it helps with the hiring process. No. You're selling this product to help with, oh, we just launched a new division, and we need to make sure that presence in a me as oh, that's really good is getting to that. That's powerful, David. The clock is ticking. I'm hyped up, but we gotta move to the final question, David, which is this. We've talked about great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what's one bad habit that you see most salespeople exhibit that you think they need to break because it hurts more than it helps? My dad taught me this when I told him I wanted to break into sales. Number one, he's number one, run. But number two, you're gonna get people asking you questions and you gotta figure out why they're asking that question. When someone asks you a question, the thing that makes my skin crawl is, hey. Do you do any sort of short term programs? Yep. We do a pilot. Here you go. Six months. Check it out. No strings attached. No. You wanna, number one, mirror, and then number two, ask for clarification. Pilot program? And then they'll start talking. Or if they don't, there must be a reason why you're asking that question. Get them talking. Don't answer the question until you know why because they might go, yeah. Because it's really important for our procurement team. We don't sign any thirty six month contracts until we have four months of data collected ROI. Boom. Now you know you need to loop in procurement. That's the question. Oh, really good. David, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Hey, Nick. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with David Rosenstein. What do you have for your two? So my first one is before you get into reframing why a weakness is a strength, you need to get permission to go on that mini monologue and tell that story of, like, why this weakness actually is a good thing for them. Otherwise, it's just gonna seem a little bit too salesy and a little bit too direct. You can hear how David does it. You can hear how Arman you did it when you told that story in this episode. It comes across as really authentic and natural when you do it that way. Number two is when you are asking to get other people in their org involved in the sale, ask for more than you think you need. Just like in a negotiation, you anchor them higher. Hey. We need to get these six people involved. And then it's okay if they say, no. We're not gonna get six people on the next call. You can have two. Well, great. You still got more people than if you didn't ask whatsoever. So anchor them higher when making asks to multithread. Number three, going back to handling objections. Whenever someone gives you an objection or asks for a feature that you don't have, think, is that something that my product team did on purpose? And then reframe it as, oh, fortunately, you know, we're not gonna do a dorm room tour today because we don't need you to see a bunch of 19 year olds walking around with the towels around their waist. Alright? And then lastly, number four, if they say yes, we would love to have eight people in the meeting. You gotta chop up the room. Here's how you do it. Number one, before the call, you're going to get your champion to prep you on the different people in the room. Number two, you're going to send pre call emails or cold calls to each of the individual stakeholders to understand what they wanna get out of the call. And then lastly, number three, once you get on the call, recap everything you've learned in discovery already, and then ask each individualized person one to one discovery questions before you go into your demo. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? If you were sitting here thinking, gosh, I'd really, really love to be personally coached by David, you're in luck because David is one of our 30 MPC Club Pass coaches, and he is helping sellers in the 30 MPC Club Pass program every single week get better at their outbound messaging, get better at their cold calling, and giving live hands on feedback. So if you want some coaching from David, there's a link in the show notes to get access to that and check it out. Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week on the show.
