## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this Playbook episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we are breaking down a bunch of objections, how to handle every single one of them, but most importantly, how to handle any objection in the world using what's called the mister Miyagi framework. Nick, why should people listen? I spent a lot of time as a salesperson rehearsing my cold call opener, rehearsing my problem proposition or how I would pitch my thing. And unless things went perfectly well, I wasn't booking a meeting because I would get smacked in the face with somebody saying, Nick, I'm not interested, or, oh, we're not in the market for software. And I would sort of just stammer and I'd get hung up on and I'd say, well, I guess I should've sent them a prospecting email because then I could've handled their objection there. The thing is, folks, you're gonna deal with objections, and we're gonna learn in this episode that objections most of the time are lies. And if you can overcome objections and get past that moment of friction intention on a call, you oftentimes will start to open the door for a great conversation with your prospect and ultimately book a meeting. So, Arman, how are we structuring this episode? This playbook episode has three parts to it. Number one, why objections happen, and what is the state of the mind of the prospect when you cold call them? Number two, we'll go through the broad mister Miyagi method. In other words, when you get an objection, what are the three steps that you should follow for every single objection in the world? And then lastly, my favorite part, number three, there are three types of objections, and we will be doing some live role play so you can actually hear what these objections sound like. And nine objections does not cover every objection in the world. There are more than double of that. So we're gonna give you double that. After this, we are going to be giving you 18 objections and scripts to handle every single one of them. You can actually go in the show notes and get that right now. This was pulled straight from the book on cold calling that we're working on right now, and I hope you like a taste of what's to come inside of that book. And a three, a two, a one. Let's ride. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Alright. So let's start with what is your prospect thinking and feeling when they hit you with an objection? And I'm gonna teach this, Armand, through a little story. You and I have been working on the thirty minutes to presidents club book on cold calling. And last weekend, I decided, alright. I gotta make some progress on this book. I'm gonna go to a coffee shop, and I'm gonna write for a couple hours. I got on my bike. I rode to my friendly neighborhood, Pete's Coffee, and I found a nice table outside in the sun. And I crack open my laptop. I've got a nice, not wobbly table, and I started writing. And I was making great progress. Ten minutes in, twenty minutes in, at the half hour mark, I hear a guy clearing his throat Great. To try to get my attention. And I look up, and there's this college student wearing a bright orange ASPCA vest, and he's holding a clipboard. And he clearly wants to talk with me. And so I look up, I'm literally mid paragraph, and he goes, excuse me, sir. Do you happen to love animals? And, Harmond, I do love animals. I'm an animal lover. But I knew that if I said yes to this guy, he was going to rope me in to donate money or sign his petition or talk with him for ten minutes about how we can save all the animals. And I was trying to write a book. And so to get the guy to go away, I literally said, no. I actually don't. And he went away. And the point of this story is my objection had nothing to do with what the guy was selling, helping animals. I actually support that cause. My objection had everything to do with his interruption. And the exact same thing happens when you, salesperson listening to this episode, interrupt your prospect. They are objecting to your interruption, not to what you are selling or what you are asking them for. The objection is to the interruption. And for this reason, that's why when you go and try to pitch or reaffirm the value or claim your ROI or if someone says they're not interested, you try to give them reasons they should be interested. None of this matters because they're not actually considering your pitch. They're objecting to the reaction. And so when we handle objections through what's called the mister Miyagi method, step number one is not to handle the objection. It's to handle the reaction. So let's go into it. There are three steps of the mister Miyagi method. Step number one, you agree with the objection. So if Nick comes at me and he says, I'm not interested, I'm gonna say something like, totally get it. You probably would have called me if you were. Or if Nick says, call me in six months, I'm gonna say, Nick, you're totally right. I shouldn't assumed you were ready right now. I'm gonna jot down in my calendar that I should reach out in six months. Or if Nick says, I've got no budget, I'm gonna say, hey. Totally get it. Honestly, I should have assumed nowadays, it's frankly harder to keep a product that you have, let alone ask for budget to buy a new one. By agreeing with each of these objections, what's happening is it's like Nick tried to sit in a chair, and I pulled out the chair from underneath him. He's like, wait. Like, the salesperson isn't going to try to pitch me? He's not going to try to do anything? He's not gonna try to tell me about why I should be interested? And they're like, oh, this person actually understood. And so through step one, you've blunted the reaction and you've removed the pressure of the sale. Yeah. What you're doing is when you ambush your prospect in the middle of their workday and interrupt them with a cold call, what it does is it triggers their fight or flight, which literally shuts off the logical piece of their brain. And so when they tell you call me in six months, they're not actually thinking through, oh, you know, actually, May would be a really good time for me to talk with this guy. No. They're just trying to get you off the phone. And what you've done by agreeing with that slap reaction that they gave you is you pattern interrupt and you diffuse that fight or flight response to get them to actually listen to you. If you don't do that, you have zero chance of actually booking the meeting. So you're right. Step one, diffuse by agreeing. What happens next? Step two is not to just continue agreeing and hang up and never call them again. That might be what Nick does, but that's not what you're gonna do today because step two is to incentivize conversation. And there are a couple of reasons you want to get them to keep talking. Reason number one, you don't have enough information about the objection to handle it effectively. So step number one is you grab a little bit more information about the objection. But more importantly, step number two is you wanna keep playing in this character of, I totally get it. Your objection is completely valid. Could you tell me a little bit more about that? You want them to get it out of their system and now you're creating a conversation versus before they were just giving you a reaction. But what you can't do is you can't just agree with I'm not interested by saying why aren't you interested? There's no way Nick is gonna answer that question. There's just no one he's gonna tell me because it's an open ended question that frankly pries into his business decisions, and it makes me feel like I'm interrogating why he has that objection when I literally just agreed with it. I don't have a reason for not being interested because I didn't think through that at all. My not interested was a me jerk reaction. And so when you ask me, Nick, why aren't you interested? I don't have anything to give you. And so I'm gonna shut down and say, I'm just not interested. Click. You have to feed me reasons for not being interested, which is what you do. Exactly. You need to incentivize them to share more, and then you need to make it easy for them to share more. So I'm gonna say this. Nick, just so no one reaches out again, could you give me a sense? Is it a, b, or c? Do you use a bucket question or a multiple choice question to give them potential reasons why they might not be interested? And what that does is number one, it makes it easy for them to reply. And then number two, it demonstrates that you've seen other people in their situation. You really did hear their objection, and you're just trying to understand a little bit more as to why you really should never cold call them again. So what we've done here is we're giving them some multiple choice options so that they pile on to us to make us go away even harder. And then we're actually going to take all of that momentum that they threw at us for why they weren't interested, And we're going to wax on and wax off just like mister Miyagi would and use what they threw at us here about why they weren't interested to do the last piece of mister Miyagi method, which is selling the test drive. That's correct. This is where a lot of sellers make the mistake of trying to sell their product. They remove the pressure of the sale by agreeing with it. They understand the objection. They get the prospect talking, but then they go right back to the pitch. They're like, hey. You still wanna buy this thing? Here's why it's valuable. And they're like, you didn't really agree with me. You And what you need to realize is this is still only a couple minutes into the cold call. You still don't have their trust. So what you need to do is you just get them to take a test drive. You sell the test drive. You don't sell the car. Here's what that actually means. You need to identify what will they get out of the meeting with you even if they don't buy. The way I would sell the test drive on something like no budget is I would say, Nick, my guess is you're not even gonna buy this thing. But would you be completely against taking a look not for this budgeting cycle, but just because the folks who usually are able to buy things are the ones who have their wish list ready? What I'm doing is I'm saying, Nick, I know you wanna buy something, and I know you can't buy something. So let's just, like, have your wish list ready. And then if we get lucky together, great. Armand, I'd like to make this a little more real for our audience, and I'd like us to do some role play of this. Okay, mister sales manager. So let's assume that I've already given my opener, and I've given you my value proposition, and you've heard that. And now you're about to give me the first objection. Let's go. Three, two, one. Look, Arman, I appreciate the call, but now is not good. Give me a call in six months. Alright? Totally makes sense, Nick. Look. This one's on me. You probably would have called me if you were ready now, so I shouldn't assume you're ready today. Just so I don't sound like a total goon when I reach back out to you, was there something you had in mind in six months, or is the team just, like, crazy busy? We're just we're not making any changes until our new CMO starts. I wouldn't wanna do that myself either. So I'm gonna write that down. New CMO starting in six months. Completely get it. Yep. Hey. Crazy idea. And you can actually tell me this is the worst thing in the world. I know you're not gonna mind anything now. But usually, when a new CMO comes in, they sorta wanna try some new things. And so would it be the worst idea if I showed you around? Just so you know what's out there. And when she comes in, you can give her a sense of what her options are to do media sponsorships, partnerships, things like that. Break role play. So what I'm doing there is Nick was coming in hot. He's like, not now. Call me in six months. And, honestly, folks, most of the time, this is a lie. He's just busy. He doesn't really care. And so I agreed. I'm playing along. And he actually gave me a real reason. He said, yeah. The CMO isn't gonna be on board until then. And so I was like, okay. What can I give him now, even if he doesn't buy, that would make him look good in front of the new boss? And that's what it means to sell the test drive, is I'm not getting Nick to think about buying this thing now. I'll get him to buy it later on when we're on the call, but the thing that he gave me was more information about the objection, and I'm actually using the objection as a reason for him to take the test drive today. I wanna point out three extremely important things that you are doing in your immediate response to that objection of, hey. Call me in six months. And what the salesperson does, hey. Call me in six months. And what the salesperson does is they immediately punch back. What Arman did instead was he agreed, totally get it. You probably would have called me. We've now lowered their defenses. And all of that contributed to me as the prospect feeling safe to give him more information. So now that we understand the Miyagi method, agree, incentivize, and sell the test drive, we have everything that we need to overcome individual objections, and that is the good news. The bad news is we're likely going to have to overcome multiple objections on any given cold call if we actually wanna book the meeting. So now let's jump into the three types of objections, and let's give you two examples of each of them. The first type of objection are dismissive objections. Basically, anything that isn't a real objection, it's a brush off or a SWAT, is a dismissive objection. And so for that reason, our approach with these objection is as follows. We're going to be what's called disarmingly blunt. You wanna have the opposite equal reaction. You wanna break the tension when you agree with the objection, and then you want to use the incentive portion to get the real objection. So look at that, Nick. I think we're ready to handle I'm not interested, and you're gonna make me cold call you again. And so let's assume again, I've done my opener. I've done my value pop. In a three, two, one, I ring ring. I'm not interested. Shoot. This one's totally my bad, I guess. Either my pitch was really crummy or you woulda reached out to us if you were interested. Hey. Hey. Look, Nick. Just so I can get a little bit better here, could you be brutally honest with me? Is it because you've got a solution? Is it you're not thinking about this problem at all, or is it that you just hate getting cold calls and it's okay if it's the last one? We're working with sales goon. Working with Sales Goon. Alright. Break. So we're gonna pause right there. And the reason for that is we got the real objection there. We got the competitor. Sales Goon was the competitor, and we're gonna save that to the third category of objection, which is competitors and existing solutions. But that means I've effectively handled I'm not existing solutions. But that means I've effectively handled I'm not interested. If you actually go back and listen to what Arman did there, he's giving me a menu of reasons for why I might not be interested. Because, again, if he just asks me, Nick, well, you don't even really know what I'm selling yet. Why are you not interested? I don't have a reason because this is a dismissive objection that does not come from a place of intellect or reason. And so if he just tries to inquire about the SWOT, there's nothing there. There's no substance there. He needs to present me with those menu of choices so that I can take one. Otherwise, the call is just gonna break, and I'm gonna hang up with Armand. So let's assume that we got past I'm not interested, but this one's gonna be even worse. Let's say that I give Nick my opener, and I haven't even gotten to my value prop or what we call a problem prop. I open, and Nick says, where'd you get my phone number? The goal here is gonna change a little bit. I actually need to get back to getting permission to explain what I do. In other words, if you've heard us talk about the permission based cold call opener before, I basically need to get back to that. So let's do it again. Nick in the 321, Where'd you get my phone number? Oh, shoot. Look. It's a it's a contact database called Banana Leads. Look. It it sounds like you really don't wanna get calls on this number, so I'd honestly be happy to send you a screenshot of what they have on file just so you can go chase them down and not me, and you know what's out there. Look. I'm gonna be honest. Like, I don't love making these cold calls, and my guess is you don't love getting them either. Just so no one calls you again from my company, could I at least tell you why I reached out to you specifically? And then you can tell me if it makes sense to buzz off and send you that screenshot. I guess I'd be open to that. Nice. So what's happening is Arman picked up the phone. He called. He gave his opener. And instead of the prospect going along with a cold call, they smacked him in the face with that dismissive objection. And so we're apologizing. Oh my gosh. We're playing dead. We're letting them kick us when we're down. So you're overcoming this objection by being disarmingly blunt. You're just giving it to them real, which is something that they don't expect, and you're doing it in four places. First, you're telling them the truth. You're saying, I found your phone number on a contact database called Banana Leads. Then what you're doing is you're actually helping them pile on to it by saying, hey. I'll actually send you a screenshot of what it looks like in this database so you can make it go away. Three, you're telling them you don't love making these calls, and you probably know they don't love getting them either. Oh my gosh. What salesperson is actually gonna tell the truth and say that? But now they're starting to realize that there is a human being on the other end of the line, and you are that human being. So maybe they should hear you out, which is what you're gonna ask for in your last disarmingly blood piece, which is when you're saying, hey. Could I at least tell you why I called you specifically just so nobody bugs you anymore? And we can decide what we do from there. Those are the first two examples for dismissive objections. And, again, if you want all 18 objections, we have scripts and talk tracks for each of them. Go check that out in the show notes. Let's move on to situational objections. This includes things like no budget, too expensive, I have no resources, I'm busy, and all these different product objections, frankly. In other words, something between your product and their situation does not match up. And the key here is they're objecting to the situation they're in. And so what you have to do is you actually have to remove the situation entirely. You need to remove the pressure of the sale. Take the sale off the table. You're basically going to say, you're not even gonna think about spending money right now. You're gonna remove that entirely, and you're just gonna try to get them in the car. So let's do that for no budget. In 321. Ring, ring. Sorry, Armand. We we just don't have any budget right now. I I totally get it, Nick. Nowadays, it's frankly hard enough to keep a tool, let alone add something new. Look. Just so no one calls you again, is it that you're out of budget for this fiscal year, or is it that you get put through the ringer every single time you try to buy something? It's a bit of both, honestly. We're we're pretty tight on things right now. I appreciate you opening up here, and I know it's frankly pretty hard to justify any spend. And and, look, my guess is you're probably not gonna buy this thing right now. Question for you. Like, if budget ever frees up, the people that usually get it at least have a directional sense of what they'd want. Would you be completely against taking a look? Not for now, but just so you know it's out there and you have a a wish list, if nothing else. So what Armand did here, he's trying to give me some options to get me to open up, and I did. I said it's a little bit of both, which is not really an answer, but it at least gave Armand an inch of space because he sought to understand the objection before trying to be understood. And he tried to be understood with how he sold the test drive. And if you listen back to what he said, he pushed away. You're probably not gonna buy this thing right now. But then he gave them a reason for taking that test drive, AKA. He sold it. Alright. Now let's assume that Nick is a busy guy. He's pretending to be a busy bee. He has all these fake meetings on his calendar. He's gonna tell me he has no bandwidth. Let's roll it again. In a three, two, one. Ring, ring. Armand, we're just stretched way too thin. I really can't take this on. I'm sorry. Totally, Nick. I hear you. You know, honestly, like, every marketer that I talk to now, they they literally have three jobs. So I don't even know how you're doing one, let alone three. And so, like, I would hate to bug you again when you're already strapped for time. You mind me asking, is this just like a temporary busy phase, or does it look like you're gonna be swamped until 2032? It's more like 2030 at this point, but, yeah, I mean, this is just not a good time then. Ah, good. Well, just to give you some breathing room, I'm gonna pencil in the contract start date for 01/01/2032, so I'm being real generous here. Yeah. But look, I know you're really swamped. And I'm gonna be honest. Like, most of our most successful customers are really lean teams being asked to do more with less and, frankly, way more than is reasonable. My guess is you're probably still not gonna buy this thing. But could I at least show you how we've helped other lean teams like yours get some time back? If for nothing else, so you know what's out there and you've at least considered some other options. There's two things that I wanna point out you did here. One, you showed the human on the other side of the phone by using your ridiculous sense of humor. Oh, are you gonna be strapped for the next decade? I'll pencil the contract to start in 2032. Okay. It's business humor. It's not that funny, Arman, but it's enough to break the, wait. This isn't some generic telemarketer calling me. This is an actual person. And when the person that you're calling realizes that you are a human being, will actually be a little bit nicer. But what created the space, Armand, to be able to come up with these witty things on the spot was that you actually slowed down. A lot of times, prospects will try to rush us off the phone, and they speed us up to try to get us to go away. And the temptation is to be like, oh, gosh. I've only got a second. Let me handle that objection and talk faster. When you slowed down the tempo, it actually gave your brain a second to think about those, putting your quotes here, funny things that got you to break that veil of telemarketer to real person. So let's go to the final category, which is existing solutions. They're either doing it in house or they're using a competitor. What's tricky is you may or may not know who that competitor is. So notice with this one, our approach is a little bit different. This isn't us entirely removing the pressure of the sale because they're so freaked out about budget or whatever it is. And what you need to do is you need to rip one hole of doubt in the competitor, one hole of doubt in their existing solution with what we call a trap question. What is the one thing that their existing solution doesn't do? And ask them a question about it. But watch closely on the delivery on this because if you do this the wrong way, it can come off as a leading, sleazy sales question. So let's make this example even a little bit more tactical. Nick's gonna tell me that he's doing an in house solution. So he's a CFO currently, and he's managing all of his equity and stock option management programs on spreadsheets. So So let's do it. 321. Ring ring. Armand, we're good. I I manage our equity myself. No. You're a super CFO. Well, I honestly don't hear that all the time. But I should have assumed that you've got the spreadsheet wizard skills for days, and this wasn't gonna be interesting. So, honestly, it doesn't really sound like it's a pain. Just so no one else calls you again, I'm honestly curious. How do you guys go about doing your evaluations? For those, I think we use an external firm. Interesting. I know it sounds odd, but we actually manage both your cap table, your equity, and your valuations. And between the two of them, the cost alone might be worth taking a look. I'm gonna be honest. It sounds like you've got a lot of good stuff going. You probably already have a good vendor. I don't think you're gonna change. But would you be completely against me showing you around just so you know what's out there? Nice. So what we did was that trap question was you said, hey. It doesn't sound like equity is a problem. But out of curiosity, how are you doing your valuations? You knew that that was something that somebody who manages their equity themself probably isn't able to do. So that's one where you actually had to have that in your mind and maybe do some prep as you were making your cold calls. And then I gave you that inch of space. And what I thought you did well at the end there was you didn't sell too hard. The way that you said interesting, I thought was really powerful, and I'd encourage people to go back and listen to that. It was like you were contemplating in real time, and you're having this idea of, well, this might be worth taking a look at. You did a good job of selling me without being salesy. It gets a little trickier though if someone doesn't tell you what they're doing. They keep their cards a little closer to their chest, and you've gotta pull out the competitor for them to know which trap question to ask. So why don't we do the last one, which is when they don't immediately reveal that competitor? Let's go back to I'm selling thirty minutes to president's club sponsorships. Alright? So three, two, 1. Ring, ring. Yeah. Armand, we're already working with another podcast. Nick, I should have figured you're already getting your name out there. Your brand looks really, really good. It must be SalesGoon, RevMonkey, or Commission Cam. Right? Yeah. We're using SalesGoon. We're sponsoring them. Oh, the Goons. I love SalesGoon. They're a great group, man. Look. It it honestly rarely makes sense to switch off of them, and it sounds like you're in good hands. So just so we don't bug you again, you seem like a pretty data driven marketer. How do they go about tracking the results of their podcast ads? You know, I mean, it's podcasts. You you sorta don't know, but they sometimes send over a report about telling us how many downloads their show got. It's honestly just it's we know it's awareness. I was wondering too because that's a problem that we've thought about a lot as well. And, look, again, we're not in the business of replacing SalesGoon or anything like that, but some of their customers admittedly have chosen to work with us. And the reason for that is we're actually able to funnel your demand from the podcast to the webinars, to the newsletter, to you. So you actually know where your spend is going and you can quantify some of this stuff. Would you be completely against us showing you how we do that if for no other reason so you can work with SalesGoohan a little bit more effectively so that you know where your spend's going. So let's see what you did there. One, you gave that menu of options. You said, is it SalesGoohan, RevMonkey, or Commission Cam? First of all, those are ridiculous names, but I love it because it opened me up. Show that you're an insider by presenting options. And even if you get one of those three wrong, they'll probably tell you the fourth versus if you had just outright asked. The other thing you did well, you didn't bad mouth your competitor. The best way to lose credibility as a salesperson is to start trashing the goons and saying they're terrible, and our podcast is way bigger right away. You started by saying they're great, which is sort of like that agreeing piece of the Miyagi method where you lower their defenses by saying they're awesome. You made a good choice. And so what you're doing is the sale was never too hard. You are constantly agreeing and validating my decision as a prospect, but you were saying, hey. There is a benefit to you at least getting some of this information from me. That's right. So, folks, those are your two existing solution objections, and let's take it all the way from the top. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. So what did we cover today? Number one, we talked about how Nick hates animals and why most objections are actually reactions. Number two, we talked about the intro to the mister Miyagi method, the three steps. Agree with the objection to remove the pressure of the sale, incentivize conversation to get them sharing more about the objection, and then number three, sell the test drive. In other words, what will they get out of meeting with you even if they don't buy? And then from there, we went through the three types of objections. For dismissive objections, you wanna be disarmingly blunt, and we handled not interested. Where'd you get my number? And there are other objections that you can find in the show notes, like call me in six months and other sorts of brush offs. For situational objections like no budget, too expensive, busy, yada yada, we talked about removing the pressure of the situation and removing the pressure of the sale entirely. And then lastly, we talked about existing solution objections, which include solutions, competitors, and also people who are just stuck in contracts. So at the end of this, folks, keep in mind, you should not memorize all the scripts that we're going to give you, but I would definitely go and take a look at them so that you can practice the framework and listen for how you can agree, incentivize, and sell the test drive, and use those scripts as applications for the Miyagi method. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? The good news is once I got my buddy from the ASPCA to leave me alone, I was able to make pretty good progress on writing the thirty minutes to presidents club book on cold calling. And folks, if you learned even a tidbit of information in this episode, I think you might like the book that Arman and I are working on. We have put a tremendous amount of time into that. It's one thing to do a thirty minute podcast episode about objections. It's another to spend. I mean, we probably spent forty two hours on that chapter alone in the book, and we've got all sorts of other stuff on openers, value propositions, AKA problem propositions, how to be a dialing machine, gatekeepers, etcetera. And so if you learn something in this, you might wanna check out the show notes. You can get access to the book or pre order the book in the show notes depending upon when you're listening to this episode. And at very least, go get that objection handling cheat sheet that we got for you. It's free. See you next week on the show.
