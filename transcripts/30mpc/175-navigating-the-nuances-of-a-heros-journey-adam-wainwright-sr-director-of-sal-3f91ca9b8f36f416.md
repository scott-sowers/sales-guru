## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Armand Farouk, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Seagalski. And we have today, Adam Wainwright from Clari, senior director of sales, Super Sonic sales cycle. Nick, why should people listen? Adam's got a lot of really powerful stuff. Are you talking faster in the intro? Truly amazing. But Adam does have some stuff to help you make your sale move faster. Everything from keeping one long email chain throughout the entire sales process to doing things that visually impress upon the buyer that you are actually making progress in getting them closer to the end state. So if you wanna move your deal faster, what I recommend is put this episode on two x speed so that you can get through even faster and go close some deals. Three, two, one, go. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to dock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, Adam. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Let's get them. So the the first takeaway for me from an actionable takeaway is this idea that you wanna always, at the start of every meeting, anchor on our why statement. In this case, it's the why statement for the call. But the idea is is that you really wanna make sure that you're setting the tone with the people on the call in a way where you can easily ask for permission and alignment that, hey. After today's call, I will have done my job right if you walk away with an understanding of what we do. But better yet, you'll walk away with an appreciation of what we do, and it would certainly make sense that we make an introduction to the CRO or perhaps an audience as a good next step. And then you might say something like, are we aligned on that as a good outcome for today? Beautiful. What's number two? So number two is that we wanna, effectively chapter as best we can the content that we're sending in our emails. And the reason why is because the recipients who are getting our emails is we're helping we're we're helping our audience evaluate what we're doing and we're really trying to sell them on next steps. They may not necessarily have all the time in the world to read the length of our email. And so if we organize the email in a way we are actually chapterizing some of the content that's coming through, a, it gives us an opportunity maybe to write a little bit longer of an email, a little more detail. But more importantly, when I open that email up and if I'm an executive buyer and I can quickly identify what the actual chapter headers are, it'll allow me to quickly kind of index what's important in the email. And then maybe I don't read the email, I come back to it later, but I know what I'm looking for. And so in that way, what we're doing is we're much more effectively communicating the purpose and the intent of the email, but in a way that gives my champion an opportunity to come back to it and get around to it when they have the the right amount of time. Beautiful. Round us out. What's number three? Number three is near and dear to my heart. This is something that I learned as a scrappy startup seller many, many years ago. And it's the idea that when you're in negotiation phase and you're actually working with legal counsel on the buyer side, always send two versions of your contracts. The contract version a, which is the red line, the bloody version, where you're actually negotiating with your counsel and their counsel. But also take that same contract, save a copy of it where you've actually accepted all the red lines. And when you send both in an email to counsel, you say in the email, hey. If everything here looks good, if we're all copacetic, I've already taken the liberty to attach a completely clean version. All you have to do is respond, looks good. Let's go. And in that case, what you've done is you've removed even just the few clicks that their legal counsel may have to go through. If in fact, they're actually comfortable with the actual red lines and they wanna clean it up, if you remove that burden, they'll respect you for it, and you can actually accelerate getting a deal done. In some cases, they'll even happily accept because maybe some of the red lines aren't necessarily all that. They're not really worth haggling over at this point anymore. So, Adam, I know you're a super process oriented structured seller. Do you have an easy to understand, easily digestible framework, process, or structure such that it makes the final yes of the introduction of the CRO easier? So that all presents itself in the discovery process. If you can create what I just call the pain slide, and you can get them to effectively agree that, yeah, if you could solve some of those things, right, I would be interested in where this goes. If you can get them to do that in the first, let's call it twelve minutes. Then when you're actually perhaps you're demoing or maybe you're doing more of a a deep structural unpacking of how their business operates. And so then you're now you're literally mapping that pain to value in the context of the workflow. So you're thinking left to right. What's the pain? I'm gonna show them how we solve it, and I'm gonna I'm gonna ask them to corroborate that there's a solution that I've just shown them. That is how you're controlling for the yes momentum. And the good news is is if you teed up that that pain menu in the right way and you've gotten them that first yes to say, yeah. If you could solve my data problem or my execution problem or my visibility pain if you can get them to generally agree on that, then you can then tee up your workflows, ask for confirmation validation that in fact they do see how you're gonna help. Then you've built the momentum necessary that at the end, you can very confidently say, hey. Per our first slide, per our initial agreement, would you say that that you feel sufficiently educated about Clari? And if so, next good step would be to do the following as I've mentioned. Is that something does that make sense? Is that, like, a good next step? Can you talk to me about what you actually put on that pain slide and how you tee it up? Because my guess is you didn't just write the word execution problem, data problem, forecast problem. Pull up the slide and say which one is is you. I love that question. It's one thing to come up with a pain menu. The most important part in my experience around the idea of presenting pain is that the first thing you want to avoid is having just pain in a box, static list of panes. Instead, what you're trying to do is create a narrative around how these panes are interconnected. And in many cases, compounding. And if your narrative when you're showing the pain menu is one where, hey. Listen. Customers will typically come to us to solve for the following things, but it typically starts here. Right? It starts with a lack of good data because at the end of the day, we don't really want our reps spending all of their time jockeying and administering data. We want them in the field talking to customers. And so with good reason, your CRM perhaps has a bunch of holes in it. Right? But the problem now is is that now your managers don't exactly know where and what is healthy. They don't have a good clear perspective on what's happening in the pipeline. And so when you kinda tell the pain when you use a compounding or a flywheel narrative to bring the con the concept of the pain slide to life, then what you can ask is, and you have to do this as a critical part of the step, Hey, customer. Do any of these resonate with you? Boom. Now they're gonna say to you one of they're either gonna say, yes. You gotta solve all of them, or they're gonna be nitpicky. They're gonna have a they're gonna have a point of view. They're gonna feel good about something that you said, and then maybe not feels as good about another. And you might just simply say, hey. Help me stack rank these. Right? If I could solve one or two of them, what might be the most pressing, or what might be one of priority today? And now you're honing in on something that you can be super productive. I call this the strike zone. So, Adam, I love this concept of you're describing these problems in story order. Right? And what you're doing is you're walking through those stories so they can put themselves in your shoes, and they can say, not this part of my day, not that part of my day, but, yeah, that part of my day. That's the one that's really painful. Right? And so you talk about identifying the strike zone, right, and then eventually mapping pain to value, what have you. My guess is by the end of the call, you know where the strike zone is. And if you've done a good job, you've also identified two or three places that you can solve a problem for them. So at the end of this call, to go back all the way to the wrap up, are you doing some sort of recap, or are you explaining where the strike zone is? How do you wrap this thing up before setting that next step? Yeah. I love that. When you get to the end and you are asking for the next step, you can weave in sort of a quick play by play recap. And the reason why you wanna do it is because what you'll typically see is the person who you were just talking to, they're gonna nod their head and say, like, he gets it. He or she gets it. If you kinda see that visual indication that you've done a pretty good job recapping, guess what you have? You have the blueprint for a follow-up either asset or a component of that email, one of those chapters of the business objectives that we're gonna continue to anchor on at the top of every meeting going forward. In the event that you don't have a good amount of time to recap, you're just simply gonna say something like, hey. I got a a lot I got a lot of really good information today. I'm gonna go ahead and send you a quick recap email. Do we have some time to perhaps go ahead and get that audience booked so that we can take the conversation deeper or we can go into a technical step or we can satisfy whatever we had sold as the step in the process that's next, you just go ahead and go for it. And, usually, if you got yeses, they're gonna be they're gonna say, look. I know we got three minutes. Let's go ahead and book it. And they're gonna promise, look. You're gonna get a nice debrief from me after this call, and we're gonna talk about all, and I'm gonna simply summarize for you so that you've got something that's transferable for your team. So that when we come into our next meeting, we've got a really nice set of objectives that we're gonna be solving for. In that meeting, we'll have a lot of value to them when they come in. You said a very specific word that I presently have written on a post it note and taped to my monitor, which is the word playback. And anytime somebody gives me a riff, I'm going, let me just play back what I heard from you. And you just restate what they said. And what you're then doing is you are watching the other person's face when you are playing things back. And if they're sitting there nodding their head, smiling, clearly saying this guy gets it, what's going off in your mind is ding, ding, ding. This is gonna be included in my recap email. If they're just sitting there and they're like, yeah. You got it right. That's right. Okay. Maybe that doesn't need to be included. But you're watching and seeing what resonates, and that's what dictates goes in that recap. I wanna ask you about the recap because I'm a voracious reader, and I often read chapters of books. And I don't know what to title the chapters of my recap email. So I'm wondering if you can talk to me about maybe the three or four key elements to make that email as action oriented for the other person as possible. The first thing I'm saying in the email is grateful for your time. You know? Hey. So and so so and so. Really grateful. It sounds like there's genuine interest in exploring this further to kind of reminding them that they they had there was a there was positive sentiment on the call. The second thing you say is what we learned. We. You wanna make sure it's inclusive of both parties. What we learned. Right? Colon. And then you give a quick little recap of what you learned. You give a nice sentence or two that summarizes what was learned on the call, what was discussed, and then maybe two or three bullet points, never more than three. Now you're laser focused on the things that were identified as potential business objectives. Maybe you're reminding them of pain that came up, but you're sort of you're teeing up the summary. The next chapter is how I can help you. If you can remember one or two things that they responded to positively, add address those. Hey. You really let know. This a single pane of glass where you've got both dashboards and an actionable system to observe and pressure test pipeline. Right? Now you don't have to context switch or move to different applications, whatever it may be. So now you're effectively selling the value, and now you've got the early lattice work for a future follow-up business objectives slash where we're gonna help kind of slide and or ask that you may use in the following and see what we learned, how we can help. Then the third one, I'm sneaky. Sometimes you do one of two things. You can either end it with sort of the call to action. Hey. Based on what we've discussed, this is what we had agreed that we would go ahead and do. In the context of that, when you're suggesting times, always manually suggest no more than two two times. I don't want them to have to go search their calendar for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday slot three slot four slot, just two examples. But the bonus chapter might be one of two. If you feel like there was genuine momentum, you might simply say investment and ROI colon, and you simply say, hey. I need some inputs so I can get to work running in parallel some outputs of the return and or what our customers might see given, you know, the size of your business. But if you are talking to power and you've got good yes momentum, introduce it because they're gonna feel good about maybe getting to a number sooner. You don't share the number, you just get the inputs. Always say at the tail end of that thing, ballpark is fine. Don't make them chase down data. Give them the freedom to fudge it because you don't care about the specifics. You just want them to know that you're gonna go get to work for them. That's it. And then the last one is sequence of events. So what you can do is you can say, hey. From here, here are the things that we have to do. Right? They're going to happen, and you're effectively selling the process in just about four bullet points. The first one is deck a demo. Strike that out. We visually indicated that we're making progress. I'm a part of a cycle. Then step two, outline what that might be and give it and make sure it's time bound. The and then you do it for two, three, and four. Example might be technical step, commercial review, right, and then, implementation. And if you just plant a really simple sequence of events, you can get them focused on the process and how easy it is, they're gonna be more likely to facilitate steps when you come asking. So, Adam, let's recap your recap. There were five chapters. It was what we learned, how we can help, suggest two to three times, and then possibly insert inputs that could help us build a proposal, And then lastly, a sequence of events, which is my personal favorite because sometimes a joint execution plan or a mutual action plan, sending the entire thing after a first call can be a little bit overwhelming. But it's almost like a mini map. So you can still have that, but then you can tease out three, four, five steps, the simple version, until you get deeper in the process. So unbelievable recap. The next call is typically what for you? Is that a call with power? Is that technical validation call? Is it a deep dive demo? Talk me through what the next step is typically. Usually, the second call is going to be a call with a broader audience, and I'm still selling value. But when it's not, it's always a technical call. The very first thing where people botch the step is they fail to anchor on the purpose of the call in a way that's easy, that's not a time suck. It's actually a constructive use of my time. Because to your point, the people that I'm in in bringing on this call, they probably never heard of Clari. Right? And they've been directed by somebody with a lot of authority to potentially to to come in and review this stuff. And so now your anchor slide, right, is going to be tailored to them. Hey. Really appreciate you making a few minutes for us today, guys. Just so that we're all aligned on the outcome for today, we're gonna do four things. We're gonna open up Salesforce. We're gonna try to identify what your amount fields are and if they're custom or not and if they're formula fields. We're gonna look at your Salesforce hierarchy. We wanna understand, is it flat? Does it got complexity to it? We wanna look at your sales processes and how your reps are actually managing the click through in Salesforce to advance cycles. That's gonna inform our machine learning model. Right? So we're gonna wanna explore that and unpack that. And then we're gonna also look at any other sheets, offline, spreadsheets, right, whatever it may be, homing pigeon in terms of how you might capture your numbers so that we can kinda put it all together for clarity. And so I put something on the screen, and I and I kinda bullet those four things out. And now, guess what happens? The technical audience, who's kinda like, I was just I'm just showing up. Now they're like, oh, okay. Cool. Let's go. Where do you wanna start? And if you do that right, now the meeting is easy. It's not forced. It's not a waste of their time. It's not that they've just been jockeyed to do a thing. They're actually contributing to something that will probably remove some burden from their day as well. So what you're doing consistently is you're saying these are the four things we're gonna do. We're gonna cross them off the list. These are the next four things we're gonna do. We're gonna cross them all the list. You're showing two or three blocks down. You're not trying to show three miles of distance on your map because you can't even see that far. K? And so we get to the end of those four steps in technical validation. I remember you said oftentimes a sales engineer is running this call. After the call, you have a very specific type of email that you have the sales engineers send to continue this concept of striking off steps. Could you walk us through what do you send once you finish technical validation? Yes. I love this. Thank you for this is an excellent question. So when we're really trying to control for the outcomes, in this case, the objective when I sell is for speed, I favor speed, to the best that I can. One thing that you can do is you can actually create a moment. What I call is it's really a capstone moment where after that technical call has taken place, you sit down with your SE and you kinda get the readout. Hey. Look. This looks like yes. We can help them and everything is more or less. This is maybe part and parcel with, the kinds of examples of customers we bring on. Right? In the event that it's a it's a it's a standard lift, you're gonna ask your SE to send a technical follow-up. So the customer is gonna get an email from the SE same day if possible. And in that email, it's, hey, customer. Really appreciate your time. Great news. You are a green solution fit. And in this case, what you might even do is literally just copy and paste from a Google Excel, copy and paste the table in. Why? It feels technical when they see the table. It's not just highlighted words. It's actually a technical table with column headers. You know, right, status, green fit, time to deploy, two to eight weeks, eight to six, whatever, standard time, green, green, green. Each box is green. Right? And so now and then, of course, they complete their email with any additional insights, some things that were discussed, all technical. Right? And it's for the it's for the audience, and it's gonna feel a little bit heady to those of us who are on the AE side, but that's okay. That creates a mental map that we have successfully come out of the back end of this phase of the evaluation. We are technically done with the technical evaluation. Send that email off, and then guess what? The AE comes right over the top with a champion or the DM or whoever is a part of that process. Now the AE is talking to that person. So SE is communicating to the technical recipient. And with the technical recipient still cc'd, now the AE is talking to the DM and it's saying, awesome. Thanks, SE, you know, first name. That's great to hear. Looks like you guys are gonna be a a low lift level of effort to deploy, which means we can get you the the value sooner. Right? And now I'm doing this sort of fun, the amped up thing, and guess what I'm sending? A new SOE with a new strikeout. Hey. From here, this is what happens. Step two done. Moving on to the next one. And if if done correctly, maybe all that's left is a commercial negotiation. Hey. Given those inputs that you've given me, I've now got enough to come to you. Let's go ahead and take thirty minutes and review how we price our product. So Adam actually did this to me when I bought Clari from him a couple years ago when I was working at Pave. And Pave was an earlier stage company at the time. I think we had three to five reps, give or take. And one of the concerns that I had is we didn't have a big rev ops team. We didn't have a big sales ops team. Right? And I was wondering, am I big enough for this thing yet? Right? Am I ready for this? Is it gonna be a bunch of work on me? Right? And I remember two things. One, to my sales ops guy, Adam's team said, green, you're ready to go. This is going to be easier than expected effectively. That's what you're doing with the green dot. You're giving me the Mario Kart Booster Pad saying, oh, this is gonna be faster implementation than we originally thought. And I was like, this is awesome. And the other thing that Adam did for me, the nontechnical person, is he was also in a similar leadership position as I was. And he was like, this doesn't make sense for everyone, but for you guys, you guys are a really good fit for this thing, and here's why. And I was like, oh my god. This makes sense. I'm not crazy for thinking that this was too early. Instead, this is lining up both with what I wanna do in our phase of company, and I don't have to worry about the sales ops implementation. So I have fewer reservations about moving forward quickly. And so that actually works as someone who's seen it on the buy side. So, Adam, after this whole technical validation thing, you go through the green light email that's coming from the sales engineer. Again, there might be two or three steps. Let's say, for example, you get to proposal phase. K? And I remember there was a very specific way that you presented the proposal to me when you were selling Clari as well. Can you walk through in that proposal deck? What are the three or four slides or the order of information that you're showing in that deck? So what I like to do when I'm trying to effectively build a reason for my buyer to lean in on the commercial investment. Right? I like to walk through what I call a hero's journey. But at the end of the day, it more or less sounds something to the effect of, here's the first thing that we're the first thing we're anchoring on in this case now is the business objectives that we've agreed are the things that Armand cares about. And they are strategically aligned, not only with what he's doing tactically, practically, but in a way where he can communicate up the chain that this is good for us because it's gonna help my CEO accomplish the big picture, tippy top of the pyramid thing, which might be get to a 100,000,000 or double our revenue next year or expand in the new cert you know, new Sam or whatever it may be. Whatever those big strategic, hairy, audacious goals are. Right? What I wanna do is I wanna make sure I'm doing what I can to sort of reference how we're aligned against that. And then I take them through the hero's journey. So now I made you sort of feel good a little bit about it we're aligned, and I talk through some of the ROI. And no one wants to go through an ROI story. But if you do it in a way where there's a narrative, they're gonna feel good about the idea that there's a couple of things that I have to listen to, and I'm gonna get through it. It's gotta be fun, but your return is gonna come to you not necessarily in, like, net new revenue, but it might come to you in a tremendous amount of time saved. Right? It certainly will come to you in terms of skip stepping the the next two years of friction filled revenue operations plumbing work that you have to do as you continue to scale your business. And so if you've got a nice subset of of of time based returns, then I can effectively drop the number. When I drop the number, I move you through that. No one wants to hear it, but I get you through it. Now I'm in a position to effectively do what I can to justify the number. But now what we wanna do is we wanna make sure that Armand sees in the pricing proposal areas which he can influence to help even get more. Examples might include avoid MSA red lines. Hey. If you if you don't engage with a, a, a legal process, I can get you some points. Hey. If you get a multi year, right, maybe I'm showing you a two year. You may get a three year deal. I might be able to get you a couple couple more point. Point is is that you literally make those transparent, those trade levers that we often kind of keep to our chest and we kind of bring them up as though it's some golden goose. No. You just put them on the page and say, look. We'll be both operating within the boundary of a win win. You and as a result, Armand now is in control of the negotiation. Right? And then and guess what? If you can't get me avoiding MSADPA, guess what happens? Now Armand and I are talking about what your legal process is. Hey. How do you guys buy? Is this even a reasonable lever to have up on here? Right? Now I'm beginning to unpack how we get a deal done. And as a result, we can come to the end of that call feeling good that Armand's got some masks. I've got some some masks. It's a win win. I'm gonna take his back, and I'm gonna go get him the deal that he wants. He's in control. Adam, I bet there are times when customers are like, yeah. You know what? We might be able to skip that MSA redline process if you can get us whatever x y z discount is, but, like, we're not really sure. And then they feel like they're gonna get the discount, and then they give you two red lines. Like, what do you do in sort of that, like, weird edge case straddle the line situation? So in the event that my buyer does say, yeah. I I can do this. I can buy this. We expect our customers to just simply check a box. Right? We're a t and c's company. We'll we'll pay it forward and do the same for you. And then, of course, they come to find out, oh, nope. That's not true. Legal absolutely has to get involved. When that happens, I will say, hey. If we can't completely avoid that process, go back to your, your team and ask them for, like, the top two, maybe three things they just can't live without. If we can just isolate it to the things that they just cannot live without, I will use that as a carve out, and I'll drop that into my order agreement under, like, general terms. Right? And as a result, I'll still reference my online MSA DPA, but I'll give you this nice little section down here so that your legal team gets what they're after in the form of maybe two or three asks. If they come back bloody, it's gonna be tough. Right? This is a two way street. I can't go back internally and keep asking for things. Most executive buyers appreciate that I'm not living in a vacuum. I've got a boss, and I've got a team, and I've got a process. And so if you're aligned in that thinking, it's like, here's the compromise. And, if you do introduce that as a step, they'll often take you up on it. And and and you usually legal counsel will find a way, but inevitably, there'll always be those counsels who will just make it four, five, or six. Right? And maybe you capitulate. It depends on the deal. Adam, you talk about this concept of laying out the trade levers. It sounds like red lines are one thing that you value that your prospect can give up to essentially make the deal move faster and buy themselves a discount, for example. What are the other common trade levers that you like to pull as a seller? Yeah. That's an awesome question. For me, it's about five. MSA DPA is one of them. Multi year contracting is another one. Factoring in growth. Right? So additional users downstream or additional consumption of data, whatever it may be for your product. Voice of customer, hey. If I can put you in touch with my marketing team, maybe we can capture a quote. Right? So the marketing side. My favorite is accelerated timeline. Hey. Look. If we can do a deal like the next two weeks, I've got a ton of leverage internally. And so if I can chalk up an accelerated deal versus a non accelerated deal, that might be something that, perhaps even trumps the fact that you have to redline your contract. And so you this is all very fluid. It's not necessarily a completely hard coded thing. But if you make it presentable, gives you a chance to unpack it, and it gives your buyer an opportunity to perhaps say, oh, man. I can't avoid MSA. You say, hey, listen. Let's maybe go ahead and lump those points on the accelerated timeline. Let's see if we can maybe do it in the next two or three weeks. Can we get legal support to maybe turn the contract around quickly? Because then in effect, I've actually kind of gotten what I'm after as a seller anyway, which is my contract isn't just sitting on somebody's desk. I've got a champion who's going and pushing Sally Joe Legal to kind of expedite the process. Boom. Beautiful. Well, Adam, phenomenal show. We are running out of time. The clock is ticking. We gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now we gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the final question is, what's one bad habit you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it's hurting them more than that helps? The number one bad habit is not being crispy. Now that's something that your audience knows. So, I I wanna say it just so that we're on the record, that's critical. Be concise. Get to the point. Executives love it when you've given me a reason to think about this, and you've given me an action that I can go do quickly. Be crispy. My number one bad habit that I coach around is, never break a healthy, well engaged, multi threaded email chain if you can avoid it. Two reasons why. One, the mental thing that happens when I am jumping into this conversation and I'm a part of a 13 or a 24 email thread is when I'm seeing this thing begin to kinda catch some steam, it's serious. This is not just a fly by night first tee. There's something happening here. I need to make sure I'm I'm up to snuff, and I'm presented with an opportunity to go figure that out in the event that that's something that I wanna go do. It's all there for me. Me. It's informative, and there's a momentum component psychologically. The second part of that, of course, is when you are steering the conversation and you wanna make sure that you're pointing back to things, having to go dig up old emails or asking your buyer, hey. Send me over the that one thing or what was the numbers that we had discussed? If that's all in disparate places, you're gonna lose time. Commit to that thread to the extent that it's offering strategic purpose. If it makes more sense that you break because you're gonna bring in somebody who perhaps doesn't wanna see some of the stuff that that's happening in that thread, that's okay. But if you do it arbitrarily, somewhere in the world, a baby bird breaks away. So don't break email threads. Don't break evil threads. Don't hurt any baby birds, and don't tune off yet because we're about to have a sixty second recap from Arman coming up soon. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Adam Wainwright include, number one, gain yes momentum from the front end of a discovery call by laying out the panes in story form to get agreement on the panes and then later match pain to value. Number two, at the end of that first call, do the play by play recap of the strike zone of problems that you've identified and look for the nod as you do the recap. Number three, the recap email. There are a couple chapters of it. It's what we learned, how we can help, sometimes, inputs that could help us build a proposal, and the sequence of events that happen next. And then lastly, number four. At the end of the technical validation call, you need to send them an email from your sales engineer that has a big green light, and it says, yes. You are low level of effort to deploy, and here are the next three things we gotta do. We are almost done. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? Well, if you didn't know, our wonderful friends at Clari are actually a sponsor of thirty minutes to presidents club, and that's where Adam works. And so I'd like to be able to tell my wonderful sponsor at Clari that you all enjoyed this episode. But the only way for me to know that is if you tell me you enjoyed this episode. So if you got anything out of this episode with Adam, send me or Armand a note on LinkedIn and tell me your favorite thing from this episode so I can pass all of that along to our friends at Clarity, and we can make even more wonderful thirty minutes to Presidents Club content for you all. See you next week.
