## Transcript

I am not exaggerating when I say the largest deal for one of our customers that's closed. It was $30,000,000, less than a page, white, black font. That was it. No branding, no logos, nothing. And the point is that this has to look and feel internal to the customer. As soon as you bring out all of the branding, it immediately says, this is a vendor selling me something. And if it's going to the executive, it has to feel internal. So it's counterproductive. Good news is you don't have to be a designer because the most effective is just black font, white page. That's it. Five parts of it are priority driven headline, problem statement, recommended approach, target outcomes, and then required investment. Let's start with the priority driven headline. You used very specific language in the takeaway. You you called it something that the executive is already sold on. I'm hoping that you could explain that a little bit more. Yeah. So the idea is that you need to find a source of momentum to keep your deal moving. And what already has momentum and is gonna stop it from stalling out is you don't actually need to sell or persuade at all because the executive is already actively investing time and resources. This is what they are talking about as an executive leadership team to the board. And what every executive always does is when something matters to them, they create some type of shorthand phrase, a couple words, a project name, a code name that is unique to them. And so the way that you link back or create a mental bridge back from what you can do your product to what the executive cares about their priority is you wanna use that language to describe the deal. So let's say the CEO of IKEA is thinking about, okay, we're falling behind Home Depot in major categories like kitchen, which are really hard to, like, picture and visualize online. So how are we gonna do a full kitchen display when we're moving to these smaller footprint stores? Digital is the answer, but, like, customers abandoned major projects like that. In other words, there is an imagination gap. The imagination gap, that's that's IKEA language To talk about what a major issue is that links back to a change in how IKEA is doing business on a fundamental level. So your headline would read something like closing the imagination gap to drive digital order bundles. So the next piece, this is where you are both measuring but also framing a problem around what you can do uniquely because the way that you talk about the problem is going to layer into the next piece around the recommended approach. Problems are not objective. They're subjective. You get five people in a room, they're gonna have a different interpretation. And so the problem statement that you tee up is, for example, these two main priorities are competing, creating a major problem. We're trying to get rid of our massive warehouse. We're trying to fit into smaller urban areas, smaller footprints, and yet we know a major revenue driver for the business is these, like, complex categories, kitchens, bedrooms, sets. How are those two things gonna work out? Well, the answer is they're not because the metric that we would use to measure the problem is abandoned carts, lost orders in these these categories. And so if we can, not only one, talk about the extent of the problem and why it's growing worse as they change, then what we can do is we can frame the problem in a way where now we're always thinking in the back of our mind, hey. We do augmented VR furniture visualizations and kinda three d models. We know that. Right? So the question is, can we frame the problem in a way that relates back to what we can solve where there's consensus everybody agrees? Like, yeah. That's the right way to define this problem. The next piece is the recommended approach, and I'm wondering if you could speak to what that should look, feel, and sound like. This is where you begin to go back to all of the different paths that they could take in order to move the priority increase revenue. Is it new sales? Is it existing customers? Kind of so on. This is then to build that out. Okay. We've aligned on the category or the lever. Then what needs to be true about a solution? And this is where you bullet point three specific things that you can do differently or uniquely to bring that approach to life. People talk a lot about the idea of, like, a trap setting question or unique differentiator. This is where it comes out to say, if we agree that's how we solve the problem, this is why us. That's right inside of their three bullets. And again, back to it has to be led with or in the context of the problem. Okay. So then let's walk through the final two pieces, and let's talk about what you actually do with this business case. Target outcomes and required investment. Okay. So outcomes. This is where you talk about the return when you follow that approach, and this should mirror or flip the problem statement on its head. Head. So if you're talking about abandoned carts or you're talking about, let's say, an order bundle rate, the outcome has to use the same metrics that you used in the problem and show the gap or the difference between this is where you are today, this is where you will be by a specific date or point in time. And so when you put those two things side by side, three metrics, current, future, becomes super crystal clear on, okay, what can we expect? And this is the last piece, why would we make the investment? And where most people go wrong is they talk about the required investment in one of two ways. Either one, they only talk about the commercials. They don't think about the project owners, the people time, the energy that's required. And then second, they try to minimize that. And they wanna say, like, hey, it's gonna be easy, fast to get started in what you actually want to do is you wanna be ruthlessly specific and realistic and say, we are not going to hit this outcome that we just talked about above if you're not prepared to make this investment. Because what you're doing is you're making your numbers right before it far more believable when you're you're just real to say, hey. You're gonna see a range or a sliding scale of outcomes prepared on what you are or are not going to invest. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this.
