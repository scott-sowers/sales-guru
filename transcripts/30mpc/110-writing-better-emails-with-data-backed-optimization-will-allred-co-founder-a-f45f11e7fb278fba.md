## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Froak. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Szygalski. And today, we have the one and only mister Will Allred, the one and only man behind Lavender. Nick, why should people listen? This was one of those episodes that actually made me rethink a lot of my prospecting emails. It made me think about nixing the thoughts email as my second step in a sequence, and it also made me think about the tone of the email that I'm sending. We spent a lot of time on the show talking about interspace CTAs and personalization, but Will actually gave me some stuff that's gonna change the way that I prospect. So if you're looking for an advanced prospecting episode, this is a good one. Three, two, one. Thoughts on this episode. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost two deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Alright, Will. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Yeah. Yeah. So number one, you're gonna wanna write your email with zero commas. So we analyze over 2,000,000 emails every single month, and over 70% of emails are just too complicated for your reader. And so when I talk about reading level, being at a tenth grade reading level, right, what that means is we're looking at the number of syllables across the sentences within your email. And one of the easiest ways to reduce that syllable count is to make your sentence structure more simple. And one of the easiest ways to do that is to just remove commas from your writing. What we find is sales reps love to expound upon ideas and have run on thoughts. And so cut those commas from your writing, and you'll find that you get from that tenth grade reading level down to a fifth grade, which is the ideal number, much faster. And just to put some numbers behind it, if you go from a tenth grade to a fifth grade, you're gonna see about 50% more replies. Number two, you wanna mask your subject lines with internal camouflage. And what I mean by that is, you know, don't start off your email with, like, a first name variable because what we find is that actually hurts your reply rates, your response rates. Instead, you want one, maybe three words max. That really just describes what's inside the email. It should be really boring and honestly kinda bland, just a topic based subject line. Number three is build a personalization process. We all know personalization works. Right? But it shouldn't be this time consuming thing that keeps you from doing it. You should know exactly what your top sources are for each persona, and you should know exactly what problem the information that you're gonna find on those sources ties to when you're going to personalize an email. So, Will, one thing that was crazy to me is you're saying it's something like 20% less likely to get an open or a reply if you have the subject line first name and their first name. And I use that for months and months on end. And so other than that one, are there other common subject line pitfalls that people use that the data shows are extremely ineffective? So if I'm looking at subject lines, SalesLoft actually published that data around first name variables. And so what they found is when you put a first name variable in your subject line, you get 18% less responses. So if you send out five emails, you're gonna get one last response out of those five. The other ones that we can point to within our data specifically are things like adjectives or superlatives or numbers, percents, multipliers. If you're saying, like, two x the reply rates, well, our data is gonna show that you're gonna get 80% less opens as opposed to just saying the words reply rates. The other one, punctuations. Punctuations are an open rate disaster. What it is is, like, if you're yelling at your prospect, like, an exclamation point or asking a question, those questions aren't doing you any favors. In fact, they just scream, I'm trying to sell you. And so if you exclude, say, you have a subject line with a punctuation point, so you're asking a question versus not asking a question, the one without a question gets 56% more opens. So, Will, let's scroll back to adjectives in the subject line because we went over it super quickly. And what are some examples where you would use adjectives in your subject line that would not be good? So say I'm using the reply rates example. Right? So if I say better reply rates, that's gonna hurt your chance of getting that response in that open. It's because you on the other end. Right? If I write an email that says better reply rates, you kind of just know out of the, like, gate that you're about to get pitched or sold to. And it's that better, higher, lower. It just feels like a marketing message. The other one that I didn't actually include was commands. So if you use, like, a verb to start, like, maintain better response rates or improve x y z. Those things also tell your reader that it almost feels like marketing message. It feels like automation. It doesn't necessarily feel like somebody showing up to have a conversation with me. So we know what not to do. So we're not saying improve email reply rates by x percent to get better blah blah blah blah. Right? So what do we do instead? You write, like, two words that speak to the subject of the message. Right? If I'm looking at a subject line that says, will improve your response rates by two x, instead, just reduce it down to its most simple, like, factors, which is reply rates. Or maybe I use template refresh. Right? Maybe the original subject line was will want to improve your templates. Just make it feel like an internal email. I wouldn't email anybody internally. Will wanna improve your response rates. I would just say template refresh because that ties back to a task item that I'm likely dealing with. And we think about how people are going through their inbox. Their inbox is essentially a to do list. And so when your subject line doesn't feel like a to do list item, it triggers to the person on the other end that it's probably something that doesn't necessarily belong within their priorities. Well, you're making me think about the personalized emails that I've been sending today. One of the things that I've learned is, okay, I should never be selling in the subject line, but I suspect that my sales emails today, the subject line still is triggering the, oh, this is a sales email. Because what I've typically been doing in my personalization is, like, let's say I'm prospecting Armand. I'll look up Armand and I'll find out, oh, he was a college wrestler and he actually was a decent wrestler. And, okay, I'm gonna make the subject line wrestling and I'm gonna tie the sport of wrestling to the problem that my thing solves. Maybe he's wrestling with his sales reps to get them to pick up the phone and make cold calls. And what it sounds like you're saying is because wrestling certainly doesn't sound like a to do list item for Armand, even though it might get his attention, the second he sees that, like the sales trigger is up for him. Am I getting all of that right? Yes. And so when I coach people on how to approach email writing subjects, etcetera, I actually stray away from the more personal type information. And it's not because it's not effective or, you know, interesting or catches their attention. It's because it's really hard to scale. You know, if I'm looking at somebody's hobbies and trying to personalize 20 plus emails a day, it's not gonna be effective. I'm gonna have to come up with, like, a Google spreadsheet of here's every possible hobby on the planet and how you could tie it back to what we do. And in reality, you know, where this person's at, where their mindset is, is they're in their to do list. They're fighting fires all day. Right? And so if I can just show up, say I understand your particular challenge, what's going on based off of some external clues, and try to have a conversation with you about that, that's gonna be much more effective in the long run. Well, what's really fascinating about this is, like, I'm a big fan of, like, I wanna reduce the amount of brainpower it takes for me to put out, like, really high quality stuff. And in that scenario that I just gave, like, you're right. It's really hard. It's easy to tie wrestling to something, but if Armand was a big golfer, I'm not gonna be like, you must feel like beating your salespeople over the head with a golf club to get them to make like, it just it's it's too hard. It's a lot of mental processing, and so I can just switch that subject line to something that's about the second half of the segue, basically what I tied the personalization to. And then the cognitive power that I need to actually put together 20 personalized emails is far less, and it doesn't trigger that, oh, shoot. This is a a sales email in the person's brain. Even if you don't go all the way down to the level of, oh, Arman was a wrestler, Nick was a wrestling coach, whatever it might be. If you go back to what Will said all the way at the beginning of the episode, which is knowing your top three triggers, it's very, very, very easy to have some stock subject lines based on what you see. For example, if one of the things you always look for is a company is growing in their employee account, you can have stock emails and then just swap out the numbers in your email where you can say, oh, it was 25% growth or 50% growth or 75% growth. But you can have stock problems that are attached to these stock things that you're looking for that feel personalized, but you're able to do these things at scale. Yeah. And, Armin, one of the things that you're hitting on is probably one of the biggest misconceptions about personalization, which is personalization. We really capture this idea of, like, personal, and we overemphasize on it. When in reality, when we should be talking about personalization is it's really just having a valid reason for showing up and interrupting them within their to do list. And so my favorite framework, the way that I like to show up is, one, create some context, but, two, tie that context for how I got there back to a problem immediately so that they know this is gonna be a relevant conversation. And so for each persona, it's a byproduct of going through and understanding what problems you solve for them, what the external triggers are that showcase that they might have those problems, and then building a process around finding that information. That's how you quote scale personalization. It's not, you know, some magic recipe. It's literally just you have these problems. We can solve those problems. So on the point of, like, the personalization, one of the things that you put in the prep doc is it's really hard, if not impossible, to book a sales meeting if your email doesn't even get opened. And there's two things that impact the email open. It's the subject line and then the preview text because those are the things that the person sees before opening said email. And it sounds to me like you've got some ideas around, like, what you do preview text wise, maybe tied to personalization. And I'm I'm I'm sort of curious, like, what is the best practice as it relates to what it should be putting in those first 70 or so characters that the person sees before the email gets opened? Yes. So my point on open rates. Right? So your open rates are dependent on two main things. One is the subject line. And so you're masking it with this internal camouflage so that you keep their guard down, and they just sort of glance over it, and they say, yes. That's a topic that is top of mind for me. And then they see the preview text. And what the preview text needs to say is, Arman, this email is for you specifically. The way to approach that is to start with an observation. I think Josh Braun refers to it as an observable truth. Right? Just a fact. What it does, it's the same thing as though I pick up the phone and I call you. If I don't say, hey. This is Will at Lavender. Right? You're gonna wonder the entire time I'm talking at you, who is this? Right? And so what I do within an email context is I start with, here's the information I found and where I found it. Right? I saw on your LinkedIn that the company is growing x percent this quarter. It just it sets the stage for them to absorb whatever it is that you're gonna say after. The next thing you do is you start to tie that to a challenge or a problem that they have. That is how ineffective cold email should start, how it should be written because the person is going to see the subject line. It's gonna tell them what the email is basically about, and then they're gonna see the preview text, and they're gonna say, oh, this email was actually written for me. I'm curious about how you describe the problem because I've seen it done in all sorts of different ways. I've seen, like, the billboard where it's, like, VPs of sales absolutely and utterly hate asking their sales reps to put information in the CRM. And I've also seen people be, like, way too meek about it. And then I've also seen people not even talk about the problem and just say, we increase open rates 98%. Where do I describe the problem and how? Yeah. So the problem comes right after the observation, which you're basically just outlining your logic for how you got there. And so it'd be like, hey. I saw you're starting to scale up the team after your series a round. And so I I start the email with Nick. I saw that you're starting to grow the team in a major way. With that growth, typically, what we see is that your outreach setup becomes a bit of a black box. And so I'm starting to describe the problem in a way that they would describe it, but I'm also not being overly assumptive. One of the most surprising data points that we have is unsure tones are much more effective than assured or informative tones. I see a lot of sales reps want to educate their buyer, And this education comes across as an informative tone in our dataset, and there is a direct negative correlation. If you are informative, you are actually hurting your chance of being responded to, and it's because nobody wants to be talked at. And when you think about being on the phone with somebody and those unsure tones and why they're effective well, think about this. Like, if I'm on the phone with you, there's a bit of a social pressure of me talking to you in that moment. Whereas if I'm emailing you, it's basically my message on demand. Right? And so I'm not there. There's no social pressure involved, And so they can opt out whenever they want. And so if you use these unsure tones, it keeps them engaged longer. And because they're engaged longer, there's a higher chance that they're gonna understand and thusly respond to your message. And so one of the easiest ways to create uncertainty in your writing is to use what we call hedge words. Things like typically, usually, you might find, this may be. And what that does is it it just keeps your reader engaged. It keeps them interested in what you have to say because they think about their problem all day long, and you've thought about it for probably five minutes. And to show up and act like you know everything about their business doesn't do you any favors. This is a a key distinction because we talk a lot about subject lines and tailoring and then problems and then low friction CTAs. But you can still have all those things. And when the email is just written sort of weird, it just doesn't land. And so what you're describing is what a lot of people call a news headline, is they'll say things like CFOs hate accounting or CFOs hate journal entries. And it's like, I'm telling you this fact versus if you just soften it by saying, look. Typically, when I'm talking to CFOs at other companies, they usually don't love doing things like x y z. Right? It's usually my experience. It's not always the experience versus the newsletter headline. Are there other things beyond having an informative tone that people should be avoiding as it pertains to tone of the email? Another interesting data point that your readers might not think about too often, you kinda hit on it with low friction CTAs. We see when you ask more than one question in an email, your response rates start to tank. You can actually write an email with zero questions and get just about as many responses as you can with one question. Now two, zero performs way better than two. And so one of the main questions you're probably thinking right now is how do you write a CTA with zero questions? Well, you use unsure tones. You say, if that's interesting, let's connect. You're basically laying out a problem. And so if it invites response, they're gonna respond to you. There's an assumption that you want a response. You know, you said something really interesting earlier about the longer you can get them to stay on the email, the higher chance they have of actually understanding what it is you do and the problem that you solve. And I I wanna talk about that in the context of email, but I also wanna say in the context of all of sales, like in your once you get somebody in a sales cycle, oftentimes sales are won and lost, not because of starvation, meaning the prospect doesn't have enough information given to them about your thing, but because of indigestion, meaning you give them so much stuff or the stuff that you do give them, they don't actually understand. In order to win a sale, the customer actually has to understand the information that you're presenting to them. And so when you do things like after a first meeting with a customer, send them 15 case studies of a bunch of irrelevant customers, and then expect them to go through them and actually understand and connect how those case studies relate to the problem you solve. Like, it doesn't get the job done. Your job as a salesperson is to do the digestion and the understanding of all of the ways that you know you can help them for them. Otherwise, they get overwhelmed and actually resist on stuff. And so I'm curious to hear from you. Are there any other strategies that I can incorporate into my my emails to help the person spend more time on them and understand them more easily? It's an interesting way you phrase that question. How can I get them to spend more time with me? Well, one of the easiest ways to get them to spend, I guess, a higher percentage of the required time is to just shorten your email. So what we see in our data is that if you write an email between twenty five and fifty words, your chance of getting a response is, like, leaps and bounds more likely than if you write a 100 words or a 125. And what does that really mean is you have to find the things to cut. And so if you're looking for what to cut out of your email and you're like, well, I've got this context on how I got here. I've got this problem that they're likely having, and now I wanna talk about how we can solve that problem. That's the area to start cutting from. It's the stuff about you that they do not care about and they're not in the context to start absorbing. One of the main things I see sales reps wanting to do is give their prospect more information so that they can make an informed decision. And this kinda ties back to those informative tones. We want to give them information so that they know what they need in order to make a choice. They're not making a choice. They're not in that mindset. What we forget is our job as sellers is not to inform, but to build curiosity when we're prospecting. And that starts with understanding their scenario, and it stops well before you're giving them that extra detail about what you do and how you do it. So the most I'll ever say about Lavender in a cold email is maybe I'll use a customer to tell someone my story. Right? Like, we helped the team at Sendoso four x their positive response rate within thirty days. But what we provide, well, it's a Chrome extension that helps it, makes it easier for sales reps to write emails faster. It's super quick, super simple. You should be able to explain what they get concretely within six seconds. So, Will, I'm curious. You're not describing a ton in this first email. And naturally, that first email is usually the longest ones. What typically comes in the second, third, or fourth emails after the first? So you probably, in your brain, have some prospects that are top of mind, some deals that you're working on that you're like, I can't wait to break into this account. And you think about them and you're strategizing on how you're gonna get a hold of them. Well, one of the things that we forget is they don't think about you at all, and it sucks to hear. But when we write emails, we can't forget that. We can't forget to drop the context in why we showed up. So one of the things that I'm adamant about is reusing that original personalization that you'd spent all that time and energy and effort figuring out. You know, it's interesting. Gong's published data around follow-up emails specifically where they've put this information out that your follow-up needs to be longer. About four sentences gets 15 times more meetings booked. It's pretty simple as to why. Because if I'm following up with just thoughts, question marks, or any feedback on my note, Nick, to your point, I'm not doing any of the digestion for my reader. Instead, I'm asking them to do it. I'm adding friction to the process. And so if I add that context for how I got there in the first place, like and just rephrase it in a different way. Right? Looks like you're growing quickly. Usually, we see that has to do it creates issues within your outreach analytics. Curious, do you have any feedback on my last note? What I'm doing there is I'm reminding them why I'm there, like, again, showcasing in their inbox that I did my homework and setting up that prompt to go check out something else that I've sent them in a more thoughtful way. So regardless of what number follow-up it is, you have to remind them of the context in which you got there in the first place. Yeah. One thing that I've seen really successful is any thoughts, parenthesis. By the way, I saw x y z. Just a quick note that shows you're not using the same thoughts as every single other person in the world shows that you tailored two emails even though it probably only took a half second to add that PS in the second email. Yeah. And and what you're getting at is really trying to avoid pattern matching. One of the things that sellers need to realize is that people don't read email for comprehension. They're not reading it like a white paper or a book. They're reading it strictly for categorization. And one of those categorizations that they're trying to make is, is this a sales email? Yes or no? And it's a it's a categorization you don't really wanna fall into. Will, this has been phenomenal. You've given me a ton of thoughts on stuff that I actually should be changing and adjusting in my sales email, and we're running out of time, so we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a ton of really good things salespeople should be doing. Now let's talk about a shouldn't. So my last question is, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Talking about themselves too much, that's an easy one for me to come back to. If you're thinking about the context in which they're trying to absorb information, it's not your frame of reference. It's theirs. And so refocusing everything within your email to talk about them, their situation, their problems, that is something that I wish I could just put a sticky note on everyone who's in sales computer and be like, before you hit send, is this framed around them, their problems, and what's going on in their day to day? Beautiful. Well, if you wish you could have a sticky note or Will sitting next to you while you were writing your sales handle, he's too bashful to do it, but I'm gonna promote lavender for you. It's a really, really great way. If you wanna write better sales emails, check it out. Will, we really appreciate you joining us on thirty minutes to president's club. And everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Will Allred include, number one, no first name, first name in the subject lines, and also no commands in the subject line. Number two, when you're thinking about tone in your emails, that tone should not be informative. You should be using unsure tones instead. Number three, never ask more than one question in an email. Your reply rates will go through the floor. And then lastly, number four is a lot of people talk about under a 125 words, but if you can somehow get it under 50 words, that email has a radically higher chance of getting replied to. Nick, how can people help us out here? Well, there's one place where I do not want you to use an unsure tone, and that is when you are writing a review of thirty minutes to unsure tone, and that is when you are writing a review of thirty minutes to president's club. If you would be so kind as to go onto your favorite podcast platform, I like Apple Podcasts, go on, write some nice words about me and Armand, and it would warm my heart and give me something to do on those lonely weekend evenings. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on thirty minutes to presidents club.
