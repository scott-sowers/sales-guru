## Transcript

There used to be a time where cold email was one of the most reliable ways to book meetings. So prior to even sequences coming out, which I'm old enough to remember actually, we had to manually write emails and I had to click send on each email. It wouldn't even send the follow ups for me. And when sequences came out, I was like, holy shit dude. I could hit the easy button, it's gonna send out as many follow ups as I want to as many people as I want and I'm just booking meetings on repeat. And the fact of the matter is, it's just not like that anymore. So back in the day, you might have booked three, four meetings a week just by clicking go and now you're booking one or two and you're like, shoot maybe if I just four x my email volume, I can go back to the good old days. But inevitably what happens is you send a thousand emails, you get blocked by spam and you still maybe get one to two replies a week. The other end of the spectrum is you research more, you personalize more, and you put more time and care into each individual email that you send. But there is so much noise right now. You can't even guarantee those emails get seen, and you might spend an hour writing for really, really good emails that your buyer doesn't even see in the first place. So what you might be thinking is, does this whole cold email thing even work, or is it worth the amount of time and effort that I'm putting in it? There's the whole in person events thing. There's conferences. The phone has made quite a resurgence. Should I just do that instead? And we actually studied what the top reps do that average reps don't. And one really unique finding that we found is that top reps book eight times more meet than average reps do via email. So what these top reps do that's quite a bit different from these average reps is one, everything that they send has this one to one look and feel. But none of them are spending hours doing account research. They're not tailoring and writing the perfect email. They're able to do it in a matter of minutes. The second thing is they think in terms of frameworks instead of template. So they know that their next meeting is not a template away. What they know is that they can apply proven frameworks backed by data that follow a very specific structure that will work across any industry and persona. And lastly, they have a world class offer. What they know is that a demo of their solution, that's not the thing that's gonna compel a buyer, especially c suite executive to take a meeting with them. They're able to put offers that give tangible value around industry insights, what their peers are doing. They give the prospect and buyer a reason to meet with them even if they decided not to purchase their product. So you might be wondering, Jason's too humble to brag about himself, but he's the CEO of Outbound Squad. He has trained over 200 sales teams including the teams over at Gong, Shopify, Zoom, and Rippling. And on average, he is able to get a team to book 20 to 36% more outbound meetings just by working them in a simple step by step program implementing some of the things he just talked about. So let's go through what we're gonna break down step by step. In section one, we're gonna cover the art to outbound messaging, and that includes everything from how to speak the language of your buyer so that they actually give a damn about what you put inside of your cold email, plus a step by step breakdown of what you should throw inside of your cold email. And then lastly, how to use AI to write your emails in minutes instead of hours. And so for example, one of the things that we're gonna cover is most cold emails contain words that are absolutely killing your cold emails. If you use buzzwords in your cold emails, you literally have a minus 57% impact on your reply rate. Using the word AI cuts your reply rates by a third versus if you can learn to speak in priorities and relevant social proof that shows you work with other people like their peers, that's what's gonna get you over 20 to 40% boost in your reply rates, and that's the formula for double digit replies. In section two, we're gonna do a deep dive into the reply method. We're gonna cover everything from the reason you're reaching out, so how to use AI in a matter of minutes to find really great insights to drop in your email. We're gonna talk about problem and solution language, so how to tee up the problem and seamlessly transition into your solution. Then we're gonna talk about CTAs, so call to actions, offers, what you're asking the prospect to do, and then lastly, subject lines. A really great nugget that you're gonna learn here is that you should not ask the buyer for their time. In fact, if you do that, you are 44% less likely to land a meeting. The other thing that we found is when you ask open ended questions around if they're having the problem or not, you're 29% less likely to get a reply. So the two things that really work when you're ending an email is you're either going to ask for interest, that could sound like interested in chatting further, or you're going to make a world class offer. So that could be a benchmark. It could be an analysis. It could be a custom audit of some sort, but you are 28% more likely to get a reply when you make these world class offers that we're gonna teach you how to create regardless of whether you're an SDR, account executive, or a rep that's been selling for two dozen years. And in section three, we're gonna cover the ultimate sequence blueprint where we're gonna remove all of the mystery around the exact number of emails to send, calls to make, and the spacing in between all of those touches so that you can double the number of outbound meetings that you book without coming across as low status or needy to your buyer. 70% of your cold email replies aren't gonna come to that first email that you sent. They're actually going to come in response to emails two through six. And we're gonna teach you some of the ways that you can bump or follow-up on your first email that come across as high status and get your buyer to bite as opposed to unsubscribe. No more spending hours writing emails. No more sending thousands of emails to get one, two, maybe replies of which half are telling you to unsubscribe. And no more banging your head against the wall figuring out the perfect hook and the perfect language to write in your email. We've interviewed over 300 number one reps at the top companies in the world, and the top performers consistently can take their top 10 accounts in their book. And they can get a meeting with every single one of their decision makers because that's what it takes to make it to Presidents Club. You land every single one of your top tier accounts, and And we are going to teach you exactly how to do that in six, seven, eight emails, and crack into your number one accounts every single week. So at this point, if you're like most of the reps that we work with, this is the point where some reasonable questions or concerns might start to come up. So, Arman, let's hit those. So number one, will this work for what I sell? Yes. We've worked with reps that sell everything from software companies like Shopify, Zoom, Gong, to b two b services, products, etcetera. How long does it take? This will take less than five hours to finish. We recommend going about an hour every single week and spacing this out over four weeks, but you could get this done in a weekend if you wanted to. So I've already tried chat g p t and email templates, and they tend to not work. What's what's different about this? So the difference with this is that we're not just gonna give you copy and paste prompts and have you start sending it. We're gonna teach you the frameworks and the principles to put AI to work for you, not to replace you. Armand, is this a course that's designed for beginners? So no. Look, we give away 90% of our content free at thirty minutes to President's Club. And so there are tons of cold email frameworks that you can use to just get started. But if you really want to level up to that next level, that President's Club level, where you can say, I want to break into that account, and I'm gonna break in every single time. That's what this course is about. I'm slammed right now. Should I just wait? This is literally a five hour course, and when you purchase it, you get lifetime access. And we've designed it so that you can dose it and as quick as five minutes a day. And so no. I'm sorry. Remove the excuse. Give it a shot. And if it doesn't work, we have a money back guarantee.
