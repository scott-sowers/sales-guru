## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. My name is Arman Trogg, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, folks, we have one of the greatest episodes we've ever recorded on professional development and generally just making sure that you are taking care of the people on your team the right way. It is with the one and only VP of global sales over at PandaDoc. Her name is Steph Jenkins, and, frankly, I personally learned a lot on this one. Nick, why should people listen? Yeah. Arman, we've done almost 300 episodes of this show, and we typically don't talk about stuff like culture and developing your people and the relationships that you build on the team because a lot of folks are very, very fluffy with that content. That was not the case here. We got extremely practical on everything as it relates to how you should be having one on ones with all of the different folks on your team from a cadence perspective, from an agenda perspective. We got into how you should be coaching your first time directors. We got into some really intentional things Steph does to build the culture of her team. And this was a really, really great one if you are leading a team at a director VP level. Steph, welcome to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actual leadership takeaways. Let's get you three. The first actionable takeaway is the secret of the squirrel, and it is mission driven work. It's your job as a sales leader to inspire an unshakable belief in the product amongst your sales reps. Instead of telling win stories in team meetings and all hands, start telling customer stories. Often, sales leaders, we get stuck into this trap of saying, oh, Sally, how'd you close that $200,000 deal? And Sally goes, oh, like, I prospected, and I talked to the CMO, and they passed me off to the head of marketing. And we had a couple conversations, the deal progressed, and then we spent a month of legal closing, and that was it. It was amazing. Instead of telling that win story like that, start telling the story about the customer. What did they do? How did they accomplish what they're doing? How are they trying to grow the business? We were talking about this amazing customer that we brought on board. They do the coolest thing, which is they put in the breathalyzers in cars for folks who have had DUIs. What we do is we help streamline their workflow process so that they can get these breathalyzers out to individuals faster and easier and with less of headache. Talking about what they do and then how we help speed up their process. And by focusing on those aspects of the customer story, it then equips all of our reps with a fantastic little story and a real heart tied to that mission. What's number two? Number two is the forced open door policy. And what this is is if you are a leader in the organization and you are running not just teams, but teams of teams or teams of teams of teams, you need to have a one on one on the calendar on repeat with every single person in your organization. Right now, mine are once a quarter with everyone in my org. It's twenty five minutes. I ask the exact same questions every single time. How are you doing personally and professionally? What's working? What's not working? What can I do to help? During those periods, you can really identify trends, what's going on. So you may hear the same thing from three or four or five people. Even if there isn't data behind it, there's, like, a feeling or a sentiment behind it. There's something that's driving it, and it can help you fix problems really easily. And it can help you find the really good ideas because some of the reps have really good ideas, and you want to be able to implement those. And when you implement them, you wanna say, hey, Helen. That was your idea that we talked about in our one zero one. Two months later, we've made that happen. That's why we made that change, and it helps inspire that belief amongst everyone. Alrighty. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has a rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. So we've forced the open door. We know the secret of the squirrel. What's number three? It is a sneaky backdoor way to get almost anything you want from your product team. We have a pretty big, sales team here and a very big product team, and our sales reps have learned a very good trick. And that is not for me to go ask product, can we do something? If you have a map of what product manager or what product team does what in your organization, you need to absolutely leverage that. Have a bookmark. Have your sales reps bookmark it. If you need to request x y z feature, upgrade, a b c, they know exactly who in product to go talk to about it. And then have your sales rep go make the ask to the product manager with the deal. So the product manager might not say yes right away, but they will will likely agree to get on the call with the customer, and then they will have a really hard time saying no to the customer, especially if it's a small or medium size request that they know that the technical team can do in a short period of time. So inspire those grassroots relationships with your sales reps, making relationships with the specific product managers. Make sure they know who to go to to ask for what, and I guarantee you'll start getting a lot more from product that you want. How many total people are you meeting with in any given quarter? Because it sounds like you're meeting with folks once a quarter for twenty five minutes. How are you actually fitting that into your schedule? Because I assume you have more on your Right. To do list than meet with team and figure out what's working personally, professionally, etcetera. Right now, for me, once a quarter, I meet with about 60 to 65 people. It's not an overwhelming number. What I do is twenty five minutes. I usually do three a day for about a month. So I kind of space it out, and then it's one month of a lot of listening and a very heavy amount of listening. And then you're aggregating the themes and presenting them back to the team and fixing those themes internally. I've done this with orgs up to 200 people, but it is challenging in those scenarios because you really do have to be very diligent about spacing them out and understanding the right amount of time. I've seen some really successful leaders do these back to back for the full week, fifteen minute sessions for a week long block. In the the 200 instance, it was, like, twenty minutes every six months. But But even that is enough to start to build a real human connection so that when you see those individuals in other meetings, a little bit about their personality, it's really, like, a little bit of a jigsaw with what your schedule is going to be. But the biggest tip is put it on the meeting and make it a reoccurring meeting. So you're not having to reschedule anything. Your EA is not having to reschedule anything. It happens automatically. If you need to move it, you can, but it's on the calendar. If I'm a rep, I go into this meeting with Steph. Steph is Yeah. Our global sales leader. I don't wanna come off as a complainer, and I wanna be really polite and filter my actual opinions and all that stuff. Sure. How do you make sure that you're really getting the truth of what's not working from your reps? So different people are are totally different, and I some reps are a little more vocal in their concerns. And to that, continue to allow them. All ideas are ideas, their thoughts, their feelings. They're all valid. So some people do come in, like, fiery with a bunch of ideas, and that's totally fine. Create an open space where those can be shared. Some people do not wanna complain. You're right. I would say about a third of the people really try to put on a good face and not complain, and you have to dig. In the same way, Armand and Nick, that you're digging right now, you're like, okay. Well, that's good. But what's one thing that we could do better right now? And help me understand how does that impact your day to day. If sometimes I'll I'll ask different variations of the question of what's not working. Tell me if you had a magic wand, what would you change? If you were in my shoes, what would you fix in the next quarter? Where should I spend my time fixing problems? If you were in our CEO's shoes, what would you say? What would you fix next in the organization? And, usually, if you can start asking different variations of the question, they start coming out slowly with some ideas, and they could start digging in to get the feedback. I remember I was asking for this feedback from my Pave team. And at the beginning, I would just ask, hey. How are things going? Mhmm. And they'd always tell me all the good stuff. And, eventually, I realized, no. They're just creating this halo effect around everything that I'm doing because they don't wanna share the bad news. And then I started to reframe my questions in a way where you could only deliver bad news. And the Yeah. So an example was, where in your sales cycle have you felt like we didn't send you in with the right preparation? Was it discovery? Was it negotiation? Was it your old email? Was it your prospecting? Unless you're literally gonna say that we were prepared in every single part of our sales cycle, I'm gonna find a gap in my training. Another good one is, what was a time where I said something in an all hands and it rubbed you the wrong way? I don't know when I'm coming off the wrong way or being insensitive or if I'm talking about the fact that we missed a number and I'm overly down on the team or whatever it was. Yeah. And that's what you need to do is you need to explicitly seek out the descent and create an environment where you want people to expose you to the trouble that's going on on the ground. And so you don't just ask for open feedback because they'll give you the positives. I would say that's the case for about a third of the people where it's, like, very hard and you have to pull it out. But there's another third of the people who are just sales reps who love to vocalize the negative and who also have a hard time transitioning to a positive moment too. Steph, one thing that struck me that you put in the prep doc for this was you said you set an agenda for all of these one on ones. And I'm wondering if you could voice over what that agenda actually sounds like because it sounds to me like that's how you're making sure that the conversation goes in the direction that actually serves you in gathering this feedback from the field. So every time, it's the same four questions. It is how are you doing personally and professionally, and I try to understand a little bit about what's going on in their personal life so that you can break down and create some elements of trust so that that person can tell you what's going on. What's working is the second thing. What's not working or different variations thereof. And some people come really prepared. They've created a doc and filled it out in advance. I'm always impressed when that happens, when they come with their clear talking points. Some people don't even look at the agenda in advance and just wing it. We see where the conversation goes. We try to steer it down the path where I'm getting actionable advice. And sometimes you rat hole on a topic and then workshop it a little bit. For example, if we're right in the middle of comp plan planning, when these one on ones come up, I'll sneakily start testing the waters on changes to the comp plan. If we did this, would you see that as, like, a positive thing? Would you see that as a negative thing? Help me understand if we balanced it out with this. And you can also use this space to test certain ideas, especially if those topics are coming up where you're actively making decisions in those categories. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Are there certain topics that you will intentionally say, hey. We're not gonna cover this in this meeting, or that needs to be done with your manager, or, hey. This isn't the right space for this. I usually lead with this is the agenda, but we can take this wherever you want. And some people do take it exactly where they wanna go, and that's okay too. I think it's important to be the listening and sounding ground. And sometimes the actions of those meetings might turn out a lot different. Right? If someone's bringing up a deeply personal thing or you might wanna think about, okay. Well, maybe we need to loop in HR. Can I talk to your manager about this? Are we okay with that? Sometimes they might bring up something that's, like, very operational and you wrap hole on that. And then your action item from that is, like, you talk to your operations team about it and see if this is this a quick thing that we can fix? Because a lot of times, like, quick easy fixes come out, and you can just check them off the box by actioning on them. And then sometimes, they're much harder conversations where someone wants to change their entire compensation. But those are the things that you'll hear consistent themes of. So you'll understand by doing this, it's not just a one off request or this person is not on an island. If it's consistent, consistent, you hear it from four or five people, and then you you start drawing a trend. And then you start looking at the data. Does the data support it? And then you can start building a business case for actually making a change in the organization. How do you get input from the reps on how things are going with their manager and figure out Yeah. If your frontline leadership staff is doing an effective job? Because a lot of reps are for retaliation. I will run them exactly how it's written in Radical Gander to the t. Mhmm. And to be fair, I have not done this at PandaDoc yet. We have not been ready for it, but we will be likely ready for this in the next six months. We have implemented skip levels. It hasn't been in this format. But the most successful skip levels and where you really identify if this frontline manager is doing a good job is running it. And you share a document with the reps in advance and say, this is what we're gonna talk about. This is to to benefit the manager. Let's say you're the manager. Right? And you've got a team. So you meet with the team one on one without you in a room and you sharing the document you have on the screen. Everyone can see exactly what you are typing, and you say this is for the benefit of Armand. We're trying to coach him to get him better. Everyone's doing this. We all wanna improve our skill set. So we're gonna talk a little bit about what is Arman doing really well that you want him to keep doing. Mhmm. And then we are also gonna talk about what do you want him to stop doing or to start doing. What can he do to continue to improve and be a better manager? And it's a little awkward at first. Usually, it takes about an hour of sitting down with reps in a room. Or if you're doing this with managers for a director, it takes a while. And it's patiently listening, taking notes, teasing out ideas, asking for clarification when something comes up, asking for a time. And and everything is completely anonymous. You have to reassure them that. They can see what you're typing. You're not writing anyone's name next to it. You're not going to say Nick said this about you unless sometimes reps want to self identify. Yeah. So you can do a self identification. It's totally fine. And then, Armand, when it's time for me to deliver this feedback to you, I'll share the document right after the call is over with you so you could go in there and read it. And then we'll spend an hour in a upcoming one on one talking about these are some of the themes I heard. This is what we could do to get better. These are, like, specific examples of that. What do you think about implementing some of this? And I guarantee you, your frontline managers, your second line managers will improve so quickly when you start this process because you they know that this is in the spirit of helping them grow and learn, and they'll get better instantly at it. And it's really healthy feedback for the team to be able to say, give advice to a manager in that safe setting. You have to have built trust with the team that you're doing the skip level with you, or else they're gonna think of you as a scary person and not wanna say anything. Could you give an example of something that you uncovered as comfortable as you are sharing, but what's an example of something that you uncovered in these sessions that was helpful or enlightening to a manager that their team might not have told them directly? Oh, I'll give you an example when I had this done on me. And it's when I was first in a director role, my first time kinda managing managers who are managing reps, and I received some of the best piece of advice. My managers got in a room with my VP and said at the time, hey. Steph does all these things. Fantastic. Yay. Yay. But she's, like, way too in the weeds, and she's still stuck in the deals. And she's still, like, trying to help drive them. And we need her to heal out, go fix the other problems, which is such a common first time director problem. It's so common. And I was really lucky to receive that advice as a result of one of these skip levels early and then correct my behavior and constantly check-in. Am I too deep in? Am I too far out? How is the balance for this group? Pulling out then allowed me to go fix these other business problems, which actually drives your revenue in a really positive direction when you have someone doing that. This is the slightest side, but I think that's such an important point around what it takes to go from frontline manager to second line or third line leader. Yeah. If you think of your work as there's rhythmic recurring work, deal reviews, or as a rep, almost 100% of your work is rhythmic work. It's a similar job on different types of deals. Right? Prospect, you fill your funnel, you do discovery, you drive deals forward, you lather, rinse, repeat. As a manager, your job goes, like, 80% rhythmic, deal reviews, pipeline reviews, 20% project based work. Right? Doing little things to improve your team. As you go from manager to director, that gets closer and closer to a fifty fifty mix. Not when you go from working in the business, deal reviews, pipeline reviews, jumping on calls, all that stuff, to 50% of your stuff is you're still on the key deals. You're still doing the segment forecast, but 50% of your stuff is on the business. How do I make sure that I'm moving the entire mid market segment Right. The right way? How do we redesign our territories for these different geos, which is a onetime project that's going to pay us for two or three quarters? And that's where a lot of managers struggle as they think, I'm just gonna be super pipeline reviewer, and that is not what it means to be a director of VP of sales. VP as is is literally 80% You're like a 100 project based to be. Yeah. Exactly. Like, where do we need to go in five years, and then what do we need to do now to get there? And so much of the first time second line managers really struggle with that transition on pulling out of the deal reviews. And I certainly did too in the beginning, so I was really fortunate to receive this advice early on. And I believe then that allowed me and empowered me to put much more of my time and energy where I did think the long term help the business needed to go, which then fueled the business' success and helped fuel my success too. So that was really good advice. I actually have a question for both of you because I feel like there is so much talk out there about reps becoming a first time manager, going from rep to manager. And I feel like there is very, very little advice about manager going to director for the first time. And so we just talked about one of these things. Armand, I like your model thinking about, okay, the percentage of rhythmic versus project. You've got someone who's a new director for the very first time. They went from manager to director, and you're only allowed to give them three pieces of advice, and they have to be actionable takeaways. What would they be? We'll start with you, Steph. The first thing would be pull out of the weeds. The second would be to stop being friends. Sorry. I hate to say that, but you have to adopt a full business perspective at this point where the business has to come first. Because if the business comes first, it will ensure the future health and happiness of the people in your team for the long term, not for the short term. It will make sure that they will have jobs in several years. You will make sure that there won't be any rifts that might hurt or negatively impact their personal lives. The best way that you can do that is not to give them that little thing that they want that will make them happy now, but to make sure that the business is healthy for the long term. Part of that is you make the hard decisions, and part of that is understanding that every decision that you make is not going to make them happy. My wife just took on a director role, and she's experiencing that right now where she's had to go from being friends with the people on the team to pushing and giving some harder feedback, and it makes her really deeply uncomfortable. But I'm literally gonna send that clip that you just talked through to her. You owe me a third one, though. You only gave me two, Steph. The last thing is being really deliberate with the culture that you're building in the organization. And knowing that that is not HR's job, that's not your boss's job, that's not your VP's job, that's your job to build the culture that you want to build. And you need to be specific about it. You need to be intentional about it. You it should come from the people and facilitating the right places for that culture to build are really important also for the long term success and future of the business. It helps with retention. It helps with identification. It helps with showing people the behavior that you want. Arman, how about you? The first one is as you go from manager to director, you have a job that still needs to be done and filled at the frontline level. So the pipeline reviews are still happening. The deal reviews are still happening. The call coverage is still happening. The difference is your reps are still gonna be coming to you for that stuff unless you've made it clear where you've decided to delegate or continue to dive deep. So step number one is as you step back, I would really recommend you figure out what are your inspection points going to be as a director. I started a segment level forecast meeting, and I was like, I'm not gonna be involved in the frontline manager forecast. The each manager is gonna manage their own forecast. I'm gonna do the roll up meeting and go and inspect managers' forecasts, and I'm gonna make sure that I ask questions about any deal that's committed or in best case over 50 k. That keeps me in the rhythmic work enough where I'm not completely going back seat, but I can figure out how to inspect across 30 reps instead of across eight reps, for example. So that's number one. Yep. So once you've made sure that the frontline manager job is still being done the right way, all of those key responsibilities, the weekly tape reviews, all that stuff. Step number two is this is gonna be the highest level one that I give. You need to develop a brand strategy and vision for your segment. My first director role was running SMB and sales development representatives at Carta Before I was a senior manager of SDR, when I first took over that team, I was very clear that this is the type of sales development organization we need to be. Right now, we're mass blasting emails. We're gonna be a multichannel SDR organization that's really good at picking up the phone, and we're gonna be damn good at selling in a way that doesn't feel like selling when we're prospecting. That included a lot of things on making more conversational talk tracks, on doing the 200 dial challenge in front of the entire sales org, things like that. Number two is, like, when people think of what does Arman's SDR org look like or what does Arman's SMB org look like, you need to put a face to that. And that's not just for the powers that be around the organization. That's for people in your team so so that they understand that this thing is going in a certain direction. Yeah. And then step three, every single quarter, you wanna pick two or three projects that move the entire business forward. Again, this is non rhythmic work. The way that I think about the different domains of leadership is in order of a rep's life cycle. You hire, you train, you coach, and then you enable them with systems. And so in any one of those four areas, I can come up with a different project of something that we might work on. I might say, okay. Q two, we're gonna work on revamping our entire training program because we're dropping a lot of deals in this stage, and so we're gonna focus on nothing but training on better sales process and coaching people on those weekly deal reviews better. And that might be one of my two focuses for the quarter. And then the other might be, okay. This is gonna be the quarter where it's a return to prospecting, and we're gonna be do nothing. But every Monday morning meeting, we're gonna make sure that every single SDR posts their 200 dials on the leaderboard. Mhmm. We're not gonna do anything but that. And so that's how I think the three things work together, and that's what starts to get you thinking on the business instead of in the business. So, Stephanie, now that you're leading an entire sales organization, we talked about first, second, and now it's third line sales leader. Yeah.

Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Could you give an example of the types of projects or initiatives that you're thinking about as you lead an entire sales organization going into q four? I love using an OKR framework. I'm addicted to it. To help plan for the work for the quarter to come and then to constantly check-in on the progress of those initiatives to make sure that things are moving in the right direction. The reason why I also really love an OKR framework is you can make it a very cross functional group so that everyone is very aligned on working towards these bigger boulders. Your objectives may change every quarter. They may not change every quarter, and that's okay too. The key results or how you are accomplishing those objectives may change underneath that. So for us, this is very common. We've had outbound prospecting as a big focus, a big boulder of ours for the last three quarters in a row. And the first quarter was all about laying the right foundations and making sure those initiatives underneath that were helping us set us up for success in the future. Projects that I need our operations team to complete or I need our enablement team to help me with or I need our product team to get done or I need our marketing team to help with too. All of those can fall under the same project management guidelines so that you get everyone rolling in this direction on how we are going to grow outbound prospect. Because I can scream at rep studio. Okay? But we know that just saying it does not actually change the behavior, and they will need the tools in their toolkit to be able to accomplish, the goals that we set forth for them. The other really big project that we've had for a couple of quarters now is helping speed up our sales reps to eliminate workflow inefficiencies, which is also part of our PandaDoc mission. But how do we turn that mirror and look at ourselves internally and say, how do we speed it up? It's not just the sales reps learning how to get something from proposal to close faster and the verbal commitments. It's also a lot of the operational commitments, how fast are we moving through systems, like our speed to lead, how do we improve that? So there's a lot of cross functional work that needs to go towards the larger initiatives. Using, a framework to help drive everyone in the right direction can be really helpful to accomplish those bigger goals. Stephanie, amazing show. We have to move to the final question. What is one bad habit that every sales leader should break so that all sales teams get a little bit better out there? I don't think that yelling at people helps you in the long term. I've worked in the sales cultures that are, like, the grind where someone's barking at you at the top. And Mhmm. I think it is fantastic for short term motivation. Like, how do you build pipeline today? How do you close revenue today? But at the end of the day, you are training people to always be yelled at to get what they want. Yeah. And instead, as a sales leader, if you can start shifting your mind on how to inspire intrinsic motivation in people so that they feel motivated to accomplish their why and motivated to sell the product that deep set belief that they're doing the right thing, it helps so much in the long term build this fantastic culture of hitting and exceeding your metrics for the right reasons. I really think that if there is a sales leader listening to this podcast and you think you've gotten the long way by yelling at your teams or turning up the heat and screaming in an office, it's time to stop doing that, and it's time to start motivating people from the inside. We don't always get to talk about culture on the podcast, but you found a way to make it extremely tactical. So, folks, I would listen back to this a couple times, especially if you wanna be a second or third line sales leader to make sure that you're staying close to the people and you understand what's actually going on in your sales org. So everyone hang on for a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. Time for a two by two recap from this episode with Steph Jenkins. What do you have for your two? So my first one was there are going to be folks when you meet with them that you really have to dig to figure out what's not working. And what Steph recommended is ask that question of what's not working multiple times in a variety of different ways. Some examples were, if you had a magic wand and you could wave it and change anything, what would it be? If you were in my shoes, what would you be doing differently? If you were in our CEO's shoes, what would you be doing differently? What's one thing that we could change? Arman, you also gave some examples of where in the sales cycle do you feel like we've let you down or haven't enabled you with what you need? Or, hey. Is there a time that I've said something in an all hands where something rubbed you the wrong way? So you have all these different ways you can ask what's not working well. You need to get the not good out in the air on these one on ones. Number two is the radical candor exercise that Steph took us through. You are going to get in a room with all of the reps that report up to a manager. It's just the reps, not the manager in there. And what you're gonna do is you pull up a Google Doc, and on that document, you're gonna facilitate a discussion and pull out three big things from the team. What are things that the manager should keep doing? What's working really well? What should they stop doing? And what should they start doing? And you're gonna have an hour long discussion with the group and document all of these things. Then immediately after the meeting, you'll have a meeting with the manager, and you'll share that feedback with them. This is one of the best ways that Steph has said she's developed professionally, and this is a really, really great way to understand what's going on with teams and help empower and build your managers. Number three. I've seen so many VPs of sales who seem like they're in an ivory tower because they literally never meet with any of the reps anymore. Steph maintains skip levels all the way through an organization of 200 people. That might mean that you need to do some one on ones quarterly. That might mean that you need to do some group, three on ones or four on ones or smaller pod meetings, but you gotta find a way to stay close to the people and get the actual read on what's happening on the sales floor. And then lastly, number four, if you want to make it to the director level and certainly at the VP level, you need to manage more than just your rhythmic day to day or week to week work. Being a director of sales, a director of mid market sales, a director of enterprise sales, or a segment leader overall is not the same thing as doing daily deal reviews, pipeline reviews, jumping on sales calls, and one on ones. You need to pick two or three priorities every single quarter that move the entire business. The example that Steph gave is if you're really focused on prospecting, the way a manager might focus on that problem is they might look at a rep's activity dashboard. Mhmm. The way a director might approach that problem is they're gonna make sure that their hiring profiles are for people that are prospecting. They're gonna make sure that every single week, the team is being coached on prospecting, and then they're gonna make sure that the systems work and their proper dashboards across the entire sales organization so that you can constantly keep tabs on how much pipeline the team is building. And so that takes a quarter to move an entire sales organization in a different direction. That's how a director or VP thinks. Alrighty, Nick. How could people help us out here? To the point of picking one or two initiatives per quarter, one of the initiatives that Steph talked about was helping the team close deals faster and accelerate the sales cycle. Well, shocker, Arman. We partnered with PandaDoc, and we put together a 30 MPC guide on five ways to accelerate the vendor review stage of a sales process so you can start to close your deals faster. It's actually a really, really helpful guide that can help you control the end of a sales process and get your deal done on your timeline. There's a link in the show notes to go get it. It's free. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
