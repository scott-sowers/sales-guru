## Transcript

Hey, it's Charlie here. And today I'm gonna be sharing a couple of tactics I've been using on LinkedIn to help me book some meetings. And we're gonna split this into three sections. Firstly, we're gonna look into finding warm prospects on LinkedIn. Then we're gonna look over at growl swell slash detective work. And finally, we're gonna go over some of the messaging that we can be using. And these three sections will all link together, so buckle up, everyone. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes.

Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. We're gonna start with section one, which is finding warm prospects. And I'm a big believer in working smart over hard. So if there's a way for me to target a prospect or a company who's more likely to respond, then I'm a 100% gonna be doing that. And you've probably all used CRM closed lost reports to find quick wins. And in my opinion, what I'm about to share is the closed lost equivalent in LinkedIn. And you'll need to start firstly by getting all of your accounts into sales navigator, and I'm not gonna bore you with the instructions on how to do this. So in my LinkedIn prospecting playbook with thirty minutes to presidents club, it's gonna share clear instructions on how to do this plus additional tips outside of what's shared in the episode today. So make sure you check that out. But once our list of accounts are in sales navigator, you're gonna head over to the lead filter tab in sales nav and create a new lead search. You're gonna scroll down, and under the heading workflow, you're gonna click account list and add to that account list that you've just uploaded into Sales Nav. We wanna only show the stakeholders from our accounts that we're gonna be targeting, so then further filter this down to just show specific seniorities that you wanna target in your account list. So VP, CXOs, directors, etcetera. This will now present all of the stakeholders within your accounts that you should be targeting on LinkedIn. But for the juicy part, we're gonna use the spotlight filter to find some quick wins within this prospect list. The spotlight filter is positioned at the bottom left, and there are a lot of filters within this filter section. But the ones that I recommend the most are, firstly, following your company on LinkedIn, which quite obviously just means people who are following your company, so familiar with your offering already. The second one, probably my favorite, which is TeamLink intro. And this one has been huge for me getting into my tier ones this year. And TeamLink intro is just simply people in your company who are connected to stakeholders in your target accounts. And the final one that I'm gonna be using is change jobs in the past thirty days. Now people usually who have moved to a new company have a specific reason for doing that. So maybe they're targeted with a certain project or maybe with achieving some chunky goals, so this one is a great one to also use. And to reemphasize the point that a big chunk of my pipeline this quarter has been built using these three filters, in particular, the TeamLink intro filter, which I'll share messaging for later. So wrapping up the section one, we should now be able to find from our target list that we've imported in sales navigator some good fit prospects who are more likely to reply. Now let's head into section two for groundswell and detective work. And one of the challenges we have when we're reaching out to prospects is the fact that we just guess the challenges that they have. This plus the fact them not accepting our connection request on LinkedIn makes it really difficult to refine messaging and engage with them on LinkedIn. So when I say ground swell, I simply mean adding the lower level employees on LinkedIn. For me, as an example, I target revenue leaders, so we'll add all the sales team on LinkedIn, and I'll just use a blank invite. And this benefits me in two ways. Firstly, when I connect with a prospect, I will have mutual connections, which increases the chance of them accepting. And secondly, I can do a little bit of detective work. So let's expand on this detective work part. So once I have some of those reps that I've added on LinkedIn accepting me, I'm gonna message them and do a little bit of digging. And I might say something like, hey. Can I ask a random question? And the goal for me here is to be asking questions that are gonna help me shape my messaging. And the below I'm about to share is an example that would be relevant for my scenario, but you might have different personas you're targeting. So depending on the insight you need, you might need to slightly change this. So when they've said yes to my, can I ask a random question, I will then say something like, hey? Thanks so much for helping me out. When we spoke to your CRO, Dave, last year, the SDRs were all using competitor x. Is this still the case? And they might reply like, yes. This is still the case. We're still using them. Now at this point, depending on how chatty the person is, I'm either gonna stop digging if they're a little bit blunt, or I'm gonna dig a little bit further if they're quite chatty and open. So as an example, I then might say something like, feel free to tell me to bugger off, but I'm about to send a email to Billy Bob, who's your VP of sales. My email so far mentions the new leadership changes and the hiring in the SDR team with this guessing x y zed might be a focus. Is this completely off or something the team are talking about in your team meetings? And, again, digging or detective work to help me then make my message to their leadership as relevant as possible. But you would be surprised at the amount of information and direction I'm able to gather at this stage by simply just asking people for help. And I've even had people go to the extent of introducing me directly to their c suite. Obviously, not everyone is open and chatty to sharing this kind of information, so I wouldn't over pepper someone with questions if they're a little bit blunt or standoffish. Just make sure you're reading the room correctly. So to summarize the section, we've now increased our connection rates from adding their team on LinkedIn, and hopefully, we've narrowed down the messaging that we can use. Now section three, final section, messaging. And LinkedIn, in my opinion, should be approached differently to email. So if you're using typical email structures here on LinkedIn, they can look quite long and salesy. So So I'm gonna be sharing two structure examples here. But if you wanna see the other structures, then you can check out my LinkedIn prospecting playbook that is with thirty minutes to presidents' cup. But let's get into the messaging. And I'm gonna share a nurture approach using LinkedIn, and I'm gonna be sharing an approach utilizing DOBs or drafts on behalf. So let's go into the nurture approach first. And this is probably my favorite one to use. I'm not gonna go straight in with any kind of sales messaging. My aim here is to get the prospect used to replying. So my structure here is gonna be personalization followed by challenge followed by offering value add. And it might sound something like this. Personalization, aggressively building the top of sales funnel, reading your job bio on LinkedIn billing. SalesLoft and benchmark kit did a study where 55% of companies shared that pipeline gen was their biggest challenge. Thirdly, offering value add. If it's the same challenge for your team, want me to share the process I've used that's helped me build 200 k in pipeline last month? And that's it. I'm personalizing, and I'm offering something that's genuinely useful for their team. When I'm offering up this piece of content, whatever it might be, I try to not share internal marketing copy, but focus on external because it adds a little bit more credibility in my opinion. And if they say yes to me saying, do you want me to share this template or process that I'm using? Then we know that they have the challenge which we solve for. And if they don't reply, it's then giving me an easy follow-up to this message as I can simply say, hey. Sharing the dot care in case pipeline gen is also a challenge for the team. It's less of a pestery, message, which I personally find works better on LinkedIn, especially when there's so many people who are just going in with a pitch. So it's really helping you to stand out. And once someone replies once, they're then more likely to reply to you when you're asking them other questions or expanding on the challenges that you solve for. Now let's go into approach two, which is the DOB or draft on behalf. And from section one, we were able to find prospects who have team link intros using those spotlight filters on LinkedIn. So prospects basically being connected to someone at your company. So utilizing this information, we're going to get that person internally at our companies who's connected to our prospect to message them on LinkedIn. And the message will vary depending on how well that person knows them, but let's use the scenario that the person internally knows them ish. So maybe they've met them once at an event or worked at the same company but didn't cross paths. And the structure I'll use for this is context and personalization followed by the challenge and then followed by the call to action. So as an example, context and personalization. Hey, Billy. We crossed paths when working at thirty minutes of presidents club. Hope everything is well. Your name was brought up by one of our reps, Charlie. She mentioned seeing growth in the SDR team when researching it. Secondly, challenge. We're speaking to a lot of SDR managers at the moment who are looking at ways to decrease the time it takes to get to a meeting or to get to a yes or no call to action. Is this something remotely on your mind right now? Either way, great to see the growth in the team. Sounds like a really exciting time at thirty minutes to presidents club. And that's it. Very simple, very concise message. And as mentioned before, you're more likely to get a reply from a prospect when they know the person or know of the person messaging them. And that's a wrap. Hopefully, in this section three, you've learned two tactics and structures to help you get replies using the messaging on LinkedIn.

Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes.
