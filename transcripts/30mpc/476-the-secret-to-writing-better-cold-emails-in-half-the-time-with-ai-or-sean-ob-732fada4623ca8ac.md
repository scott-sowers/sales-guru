## Transcript

Instead of doing a Google search and trying to read an article and find all this information, what the AI is doing is just shortening this gap. So something that used to take you thirty minutes, sixty minutes to write an email, now you're in about, like, five to ten minute range where it's identifying all of the relevant prospects at an account. It's giving you actionable emails, actionable tips, actionable articles that you can use, but I'm still manually writing the email. But the AI enables you to get a higher volume of them out at a much more effective commentary. I can put an okay email into ChatGPT, ask it to improve, ask it to make suggestions, pull those emails out, and now they're custom, they're relevant. It's not a silver bullet, but it's just dramatically increasing efficiency. And for me, who has historically struggled with writer's block, it's just really helpful to have that backup support to really improve what I'm doing. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to an episode of thirty minutes to president's club, the sell show. I'm your host for today, Nick Sigelski, and I'm joined with a new far superior cohost for this episode, superior to Armand, that is. He's gonna be mad at me for saying this, but we've got Jason Bey on the show. If you don't know Jason Bey, he is the CEO of Outbound Squad, which is an incredibly successful sales training company. You work with all sorts of really, really incredible sales teams, Jason, helping them uplevel their outbound, and we just partnered with you to release a full cold email course. And in this episode, we have Sean O'Brien, who is a rep that I know Arman personally coached for many, many years, and he crushed it. He did a 130% of his number last year at Mosaic, and he just started a new company called Harvey, which is selling AI to law firms. Jason, why should people listen? I think the number one thing is this whole AI thing people talk about, but there isn't a lot of really great advice on how to make it work for you. So if you're wondering what kind of prompt should I give, how do I train this to give me something that's really good in terms of research and emails, he's gonna talk about that. The second thing is low hanging fruit. Specifically, he's gonna talk about why it's important to be a wizard at Salesforce so you can find buried treasure using AI really easily. So think about deals where people said reach out to me or now is not a good time, and maybe there were some email correspondence. He's got some really great stuff to help you find some of that buried treasure. And then lastly, round swelling. He talks through a technique. Look. I mean, we would love to get the meetings with the SVPs in the C Suite. Right? If that's not always gonna happen, most of the time it's not at the enterprise level. So how do you work with someone that is maybe an IC or a manager, get some insights, and then bubble that up to secure meetings within your dream accounts? He's gonna give you some really good stuff on that. And the three, a two, a one. Let's roll the tape. Alright, Sean. Welcome to the show. You might know that we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways. So let's get your three. Yeah. So number one, what we're gonna go for is finding buried treasure inside Salesforce. So what a lot of people might not know is that every single field is searchable, including the subject line of emails. So for outreach, for example, they have an outreach email in, subject line feature. So this is how I found a very large number of opportunities. You can actually search the email's body for commentary regarding if people asked you to follow-up, if they said not at the right time, if they said they're interested, but they have another competitor. And that's been a gold mine of actually searching Salesforce emails to find, opportunities. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Beautiful. What's number two? At the end of a call, if you're having a good conversation with a prospect, and I found this is my best way to get people to sell with me instead of making me selling to them. At the end of the call or before I kill the Gong recording, I ask, hey. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions off the record? I'll pause the recording, and then we'll go into our standard post call questions, helping us to uncover potholes and get the real sales process in a efficient manner and getting somebody on your team. Hey, Sean. Off the record, could you give me, number three? Off the record, number three. So if you guys aren't using AI for prospecting and particularly perplexity, you're missing out on a lot of good gems. So anytime I'm starting to do account research, that's actually going to start with perplexity. So, for example, I work for an AI company. Anytime I start a search, I ask perplexity, hey. Who at the firm is most likely to have AI initiatives? Mhmm. At that time, Perplexity will pull the individuals and any articles associated with them, and that actually allows me to write much more detailed and relevant emails using language of the prospect, and that's really helped us improve and increase reply rates, as well. I mean, a lot of people two or three years ago have seen the shitty emails, right, that AI has pumped out. And I think that there was this thinking that, hey. This AI thing is gonna be as easy as when sequences came out. I'm just gonna be able to hit a button and type in a search, and it's gonna do all the thinking for me. When in reality, it's not that easy. Right? There's a there's a training process. And I'm curious, How do you train the AI to get it to the point to where it actually does give you useful information? It's a little less of a training process, and it is still very fairly manual, but it's giving you such better information. So, for example, like, instead of doing a Google search and trying to read an article and find all this information, what the AI is doing is just shortening this gap. So something that used to take you thirty minutes, sixty minutes to write an email, now you're in about, like, five to ten minute range where it's identifying all of the relevant prospects at an account. It's giving you actionable emails, actionable tips, actionable articles that you can use, but I'm still manually writing the email. So I'll still manually write the email. I have some baseline templates, you know, that I still have saved in SalesLoft, but these are actually custom emails. You know, I have 50 accounts. These accounts are law firms for the most part. It's not like we have thousands of contacts to burn through, so each touch is important. So we these are still manual touches, but the AI enables you to get a higher volume of them out at a much more effective commentary. And so me, I actually used to have really bad writer's block. And so something that AI has been really helpful for me, I can put an okay email into chat g p t, ask it to improve, ask it to make suggestions, and then run through a few options that I like best, and then put pull those emails out. And now they're custom, they're relevant, and they are still, like, manual. So it's not a it's not a silver bullet, but it's just dramatically increasing that efficiency. And for me, for somebody who has historically struggled with writer's block, it's just really helpful to have that backup support to really improve what I'm doing. So when you're doing an account plan, what does the prompt sound like? How do you how do you guide it to give you, like, the nuggets? Are you telling it what your company is and what it does, giving it example case studies? Like, what are you doing in the prompts to make sure that you get your information spit back out at you? Yes. So for me, I actually prefer to do it a little bit more piecemeal. So I like phase one. I like to pull the contacts that I'm looking for. So I look for law firms. I know who I wanted to find. So I wanna find people on the executive committee, people on the innovation team, individuals with AI in their job titles. That's sort of like step one of my research. Then for step two, I actually ask Now I'm looking for things that I can write and comment on. So then for phase two, I'm asking, has anybody actually referenced AI publicly? Has anybody referenced anything that I can find? Then I'm having perplexity pull all that information, and I can build that into my account plan as step two. Then the third thing that I'm doing for actually writing and pulling things in, you know, we've had some people at our company who have made internal GPTs, And these are actually really easy. We can include a little YouTube short in the show notes, but you can upload all of your case studies. You can upload referenceable customer lists. And then when you're going to the actual composing phase, say you wanna find five other Canadian firms. You have your referenceable customers. You can say give me three other Canadian firms that I can reference in this email to make it more relevant as well. So that's sort of my process. That's kind of like a three step process for going from cold to contacts to why I'm actually reaching out is the is the structure that I have for outbounding. So it's like targets, finding the people, there's intel that you have it gathered for you, and and then there's composing the message. And and then proof proofreading and, you know, helping me, fire fire those out at an appropriate rate. What you're doing is you're saying, hey. Help me identifying the partner on the tech committee and the innovation partner and the associate onboarding partner, like the people who have leadership roles, not just their partners at the law firm, and you're identifying the people to reach out to. Then what you're doing is you're saying, hey. Help me find a nugget of information that I can reference when I reach out to one of these people. And that's what is actually going into the email that you are writing right now, mostly by hand, but with some proofreading from Chad GBT. I'm wondering if we can take this example even one layer deeper. And so let's say you use perplexity, which is what it sounds like you're using, to identify the partner who chairs the tech committee at a large law firm. What will you so you'll ask it to, like, look for a referenceable nugget. Like, what's an example of something that you might get back? What are you looking for? And then, like, how does that actually feed into your templated email? Yeah. So happy happy to be a real example. This is this is what I'm working on. So, you know, Rutan and Tucker is one of my accounts. They have publicly stated that they have an AI firm policy. This is an email from 2023. It has their four or five different benchmarks for what they wanna use. So now if you look for this on Google, you're never gonna find it. But because there's AI reference in the title, now I have those four emails. I'm writing them. I'm writing an email. I have my, like, basic template To clarify, these are, like, internal emails that were circulated that got posted publicly of, like, these are our focuses as a firm. Exactly. It wasn't an email, but it was a blog post. And so then I have my baseline templated email, and then I asked JGPT to also include two sentences, tying these two emails together. So tie this post together with this post for my email about who's Harvey and who we are and how we help firms of the similar size in the area. Yeah. And then now I've had this article plus an email, like a template email, and now this is one custom email. And then I proofread it and made some adjustments. And, you know, me and my SDR Zach are working on getting this out to the relevant people, but that's, like, a real life example of how we can actually do that using using perplexity. I think to make this applicable to anyone that might be listening that maybe they have a solution they sell with the triggers or maybe not quite so on the nose. What do you do when you can't find something AI related? What else do you have it look for? Yeah. So if I can't find something AI related, then this will just be more industry trends. So then, like, as a backup, if I can't find something, I just like to talk about an industry trend that I'm seeing or something that's more relevant for a specific industry. In Australia, a lot of firms are very security focused, and they they mentioned this publicly. So this is, like, another trigger where we can talk through, an industry term that I was doing a search, what are, like, the top 10 items that firms are caring about. Security is one of them. In my active conversations that I'm having as a rep, I know this is actually a focus. So now that's actually something I can also use from an outbound approach, finding recent articles as well. So as a sales rep, not an SDR, I would also really encourage you to use your active conversations for your prospecting. You know what resonates. You know what hits home, and then try to then tie those two together. And that might not always be via AI, but you can maybe try to surface those from the individual companies if they're not quite on the nose, the industry trends and conversations and topics that you're having in your day to day sales. What is the copy that you actually put in that email when you reach out to them to, like, call out that trend and then tie it to what you sell? Yeah. So, for example, and then this copy. So there's a it's one of the first things that always comes up. You know, they also wanna integrate their systems and information. Mhmm. And they have an they have a concept called least privilege. So in the emails that I'm writing to them, I'm letting them know that, hey, Harvey. We're, you know, hey. We're the ad company. We're using x, y, and z. Mhmm. But we've also have, like, this seek like, concept of, like, least privileged security that we've passed from other large firms. That gives us the social proof. That lets them know that we know that what we're talking about. And then it's also important to send this to the right persona. This is something that you're sending to CTOs, more people in the security side versus somebody on the knowledge management side that that might not be quite as relevant for you to send a message like that out to as well. I think there's a couple of things. Like, there's a really good takeaway here that I don't wanna gloss over, and it's the triggers. I I don't think the triggers are quite so obvious for everyone that's listening to this where we have we talked about in the cold email course hard versus soft triggers. Right? The hard trigger is, like, the thing that is on the nose. It's the problem. They're publicly talking about something that literally your solution helps with. And then the soft trigger is, like, something that is problem adjacent. Like, in your case, Sean, that might be we see that they're hiring people with AI in their job title. We don't know that what they're gonna be working on or what the problem is, but it's a pretty good indicator a conversation might be relevant. I love your idea of and I just did this recently. With the sales calls, you said take the nuggets in there and essentially move that forward into the outbound process to find triggers. A really simple thing here is you guys download the transcripts of your sales calls. You can just ask chat g b t or or whatever. Hey. What are my prospects talking about that would be great triggers for me to identify when I'm personalizing my cold emails? And it'll spit out a list of stuff that you can then use every time you go to do account research, and you have a list of ten, fifteen, 20 keywords that it could be AI. It could be a bunch of different stuff that you wanna have it scrape 10 k's for, 10 q's, blog posts, whatever. That iterative process, I think, is really important to double click on so that your sales calls and what you learn there is improving your outbound process as well. So, Sean, one of the things that you were telling me in the prep call is, like, you literally only have 50 accounts. And I'm thinking about how fast some of this AI research could let you move. Like, dude, you could literally burn through all of those accounts in, like, a week if you wanted to. And so I'm curious about, like, when you're working an account, I've got a couple questions. Like, how many people do you reach out to at a time? Like, how many touches will you have when you're reaching out to them? What's the mix of, like, calls and emails versus social? How often do you revisit accounts? Because I my guess is you have to go back to people that rejected you in the past or ignored you in the past. Like, how are you actually weaving this into, like, fairly enterprise upper upper mid market prospecting? Yeah. So there's a few things. You know? Obviously, at first, go right to the top. You know? As much as possible, just try to get your quick wins. Like, you might be able to have an AI initiative. You get a response right away and get your wins. So first is we're trying to do the cold email. We're trying to do the outreach. We're trying to leverage connections that we have at the firm, whether that's they know somebody who we're connected with. We have a second degree TeamLink connection. This is a small market, so introductions and referrals are very important. Normally, try about four to five touches over about a month at first, but we don't wanna burn these accounts and blow them up with too much outreach. Then the other thing that's worked well for me is actually going down to go up. Mhmm. So there are lots of individuals. There are lots of team members at this at a lot of these firms. So actually speaking to associates, speaking to senior associates, learning what their problems are, this worked well for me at another one of my tier one accounts. I wasn't able to break into the account at the top level. But what I was able to do was have four or five conversations with various associates, and they were all telling me the same thing. Just, you know, stack all over the place. They haven't had success. They're looking to get wins. But then that email actually didn't bring me back around. But when I had that sales conversation, I actually had a lot of insight that I was able to bring to them when we had a reengaged conversation. So I knew about who they're piloting, what hasn't worked, what the associates are actually talking about, and what they don't and don't like. So that actually was one where I didn't break into the account. They just came back around naturally. Mhmm. But that prospecting work made that conversation work a lot more efficiently. The other one that I wanna stress is, like, on-site has been huge, and it's great outbound and outreach material. So if you know there are conferences coming up, if you're going to be in somebody's city, if you are seeing people that are related, you know, everybody on our team, they share where they're going. And this is another great free trigger for us to reach out to people without it being an annoying email. And the power of in person has really shown. One of my team members, she's gotten tons of opportunities just from reaching out to people asking if they're going to a big conference. They say no, but now you've opened the door for that conversation as well. And then once the in persons are happening, it really accelerates the sales cycle. So I know this is a big topic recently, but it really is at Harvey, it really shows. Like, we do get on-site a lot, and it is received very well in what can be a a noisy and competitive market. So, yeah, just just quick plug for for on sites and getting in person in whichever way, shape, or form. So ground swell you've talked about, it's such an effective technique, and it just takes time though. Right? It's it's of course, we would all love to get a meeting with the senior most stakeholder in the deal. Right? I'm curious if we were to get tactical, how do you decide who to reach out to? And what's the approach? Is it like a, hey. I just gonna send out a bunch of feeler emails that are sort of, like, pretty templated? Like, how do you secure that first conversation and explain the reason why you wanna meet with them? And the actual conversation itself, are you asking for an introduction, asking if you can drop their name? Like, if you were to get pretty tactical, how does that typically go down? So the easiest thing that we're doing is is people that are following our company. You know, you go to LinkedIn. You create a safe search. You have people who are following your firm. So that's gonna be number one. And then the number two one that I like to do, it's somewhat easy to tell who works with who. So then people that are on the executive committee, like, whatever departments they're in, I try to go to their more junior associates and reach out to them. And, essentially, what I'm doing is I'm reaching out reaching out to them like I would a partner telling them what Harvey is and how we help, and then I offer them just to do a demo of the product and to get their feedback and to learn a lot more about what's going on. So it's a it's a pretty lightweight ask. You know, people are interested. They do wanna learn about it so that it's really just a conversation about what they're doing, how they're using AI, if they're using AI, and then showing them the product. And then from there, you know, honestly, leveraging what I was talking about at the top of the call with that some of that, like, off the record stuff. Yeah. People do have strong opinions, but they don't always wanna talk about it on a sales call. So killing the recording, talking about those, that gives us good nuggets to then either come back around or to have patience and and leverage though that information you learned, during the sales cycle itself. But following like, number one is just following. And then number two, if I can go just vertically wise and see who would be you know, maybe there's three m and a lawyers, and there's six m and a associates reaching out to those m and a associates because I know they're tied to the key decision maker. Mhmm. And do you then ask for an introduction typically, or do you just say, I'm gonna go myself to their boss? I'm gonna circle back in that email chain and say, I I just talked to Sean. Here's what I learned. Here's why I think that we should talk. How does that typically work? Yeah. So, like, I always ask for the introduction. And then, also, be considerate of these people. Like, ask. Like, ask if it's okay. Ask if it's okay to reference them. Ask if you don't want me to reference them. You know? Ask if there's anything that you want to keep this off the record. You know? Like, they're, in a way, doing us a favor by putting their name out there or even sharing some of this information, with us. So one thing that I think is really important is just to be considerate of your prospects and everyone that you're speaking to. Because if you're not, you can burn a bridge very quickly. So that's the other thing when you're going down and going around. Like, it is very important to ask for permission as well because people can be fairly sensitive about this, and it and it can impact their career. So it's it's important just to have a level of awareness when you're doing things like that that you you should get permission, and it's it's not worth it if they say no. Just work around it, get somebody else, or there could be some baseline information that you can reference that's obviously not going to include them. But, yeah, I I do really wanna stress the importance of, like, asking for for permission as well when you're working with these people's professional careers. You mentioned that you have an SDR who's on your team also helping you find ways to break into these 50 accounts in your book of business. How do you and your SDR typically work together? Are you saying, hey. You tackle all the associates. I'm gonna reach out to the more senior people. Do you assign them, like, b and c tier accounts to focus on, so you just focus on the a tiers? What's your approach in getting the most out of that relationship with your SDR? Yeah. So I would say there's two things that we'll do. I'll take the first pass at all of the senior tier one contacts. So that'll always be something that I'm gonna be doing with the first, like, let's call it five touches. If that doesn't work, I'll often then have my SDR reach out to some of the more junior team members. And, honestly, sometimes, it just needs to be a different person with the same message. I've seen it time and time again. Having that teamwork is great. Like, I was working for months to get into account. My SDR, Zach, I gave it to him. He writes a fantastic email. You know, three weeks later, we have an on-site. Now we're actually in a deal cycle. So lose the ego. Like, the SDRs can can break into these accounts too. You know, sometimes, who knows, your inbox gets put into spam. Mhmm. You know, it they're just tired of seeing your name, and somebody new comes in the mix, and they can get you back in the in the mix. So process wise, I always try to go after the tier ones for the first four or five touches. If that doesn't work, then I'll sort of tag my SDR in, and then I'll also have him going over after some of the more below the line ones and then following up if my initial outreach wasn't successful. And then also me coming back over the top of his successful emails is another way to help, you know, drum up conversations. So, Sean, with your emails, because it's such a big part of your approach, you mentioned, hey. I have to have a good balance of not sending too many emails. I don't wanna, you know, bombard the prospect. But with your emails, what does good look like? What's what's that structure? And provide an example if you have one too. Yeah. I can I can share an example in the show notes? But so one quick example is the structure that I always like to use is, like, this is, like, this is obviously a custom email. So first touch is going to be something personal about them as well as in the subject line, like, just a custom subject line about what they're talking about. I I do try to keep it simple, though. Like, I do don't like these things to be more than, like, three or four sentences each. So it's really gonna be, like, individual, like, prospecting fact about them, who Harvey is, you know, let's chat. Mhmm. Second one is going to be another and I like to break these up so that over the sequence of four, I don't always have to use all of my ammo in the first email. Mhmm. So then the second touch, I like to have one little nugget, and it's more of a bump touch. It's like, hey. Here's this other thing that I learned about you. Did you catch this? The third one is normally a bit more firm specific. Mhmm. Something that I learned about the firm as well as another thing that Harvey can help out with. And then the fourth one is going to be more of a social proof along the lines of we work with these three, four, five of your competitors. Mhmm. Would you like to chat in that way? So for me, that's that's been my structure. And then, also, we're tying that in with LinkedIn outreach comments, seeing what's going on with the firm as well. But that's been my, like, general, structure as far as, like, how I'm writing the emails and how I'm structuring the, you know, sequence for for Album. So these emails are all connected, I would assume, on the same email chain, and it sounds like you you customize every email that you send. For the tier ones. Yes. Yeah. That's a good note to to make there for anyone selling enterprise that when you are able to find these nuggets and it's a tier one account, like, the level of customization through the sequence can make a big difference. If we were to break down that first email a bit, when you say to the individual, are you talking like you found something that they said, hey. We wanna implement AI into x y z process. You find a blog article. Is that the thing that you're referencing in the subject line in the first line of the email? That is. Like, I like to use language that they have talked about or referenced particularly in the subject line. You know, one of my prospects was very LinkedIn heavy. You know, he had a note in LinkedIn, like, the power of a smile, throw that in the subject line. You know, that's gonna stick out to him. He wrote it the other day. That was one where I got a response from Bower Smile. I've never been the best at transitions, so wrote an okay email, asked Chad to be de connect to connect it a little bit better. Yeah. And now it actually works a little bit more smoothly than, like, clunky email body response. One of, like, my favorite prospecting emails I ever sent, there was a lawyer who, like, he posted on his Twitter, I guess it's x now, about how he was always on the hunt for the ultimate cheeseburger, and he would, like, post cheeseburger reviews. And so I sent him a email with the subject line, the ultimate cheeseburger. And then it would literally just was like, here's what your perfect day might look like. One, you eat a cheeseburger here, which is the number one rated cheeseburger joint in Vancouver, which is where he was. Two, and then I tied this into a problem that a lot of law firms had, which is they hate entering their time, and the solution I sold at the time could automatically do it for them. You don't have to waste any time eating, filling out your time sheets, and so you get to eat two cheeseburgers. And I got a response right away because I used something that was totally unrelated to him, but then ended up finding a way to tie it to the solution. I'm sure chat g b t could have done it more eloquently, but, yeah, the nugget there is, like, parroting their language is such a good way to get their attention. Alright, Sean. We're running out of time, so we gotta move to our final four questions. The first one, these are gonna go rapid fire, so give it to me short. What is your number one cold call tactic? For me, I don't like to open up with this is Sean from Harvey. When I hear that, I immediately put walls up. I think that's a sales rep I've gotten cold call. So I actually like to just open up with the reason why that I'm calling. Hey. This is Sean. I saw you have a AI initiative about blank or just get right into it. The the Sean from, I feel like, is a big red x on I don't wanna talk to this gold caller right now. Question number two. What is your number one discovery question? It's really at the end of a discovery call, more specifically a demo on the from a one to 10, how do we feel about what we just saw? It's not even one question. It's more of a framework. If it's a 10, you're in a good spot. If you know that it's anything less, you can ask what it was missing, and it gives you a chance to kind of, you know, get get on the right footing right there. Sean, what's the number one way that you get a prospect to respect you? It's it really is just being knowledgeable and educated about your market, like spending time learning, being able to demo correctly, being able to come to them with relevant examples and stories. I don't have a quick nugget for it. It's just spend your time learning from your org, org, learning from team members. It it shines through in in conversations, and they they can tell, if you're not doing your homework. Lastly, what's the number one thing you do outside of sales to make it to president's club? I mean, a bit bit ironic, but, honestly, a huge podcast guy. There's so much knowledge out there, like, not even sales podcast, but there's so much information. If there's anything you're interested in, you wanna learn more about, you know, I'm probably listening to at least one or two podcasts every single day where you can take things even if it's a non sales podcast, put it in your day to day. I think it just makes you a stronger seller and, you know, business person in as in in general. What's your go to podcast that's not sales? The moment, my two two favorite are Tim Ferriss's podcast and then, Chris Williams' modern, Modern Wisdom are the two most recent favorites at the moment. Sean, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alright, Jason. It's time for your two by two recap. What do you got for number one? I think number one was the idea of using your sales findings, the nuggets that you hear in sales calls, using that to pull forward into the outbound motion. So taking sales transcripts of calls, recordings, etcetera, and feeding that into AI so that it knows what triggers to look for. The second thing was this idea of ground swell that we talked about before. Specifically, what I thought was really interesting around that was sticking within the same department, going for the opt in, making sure that you have their permission to share, and then I love the idea of going off the record. So how do you get the really, really good nuggets around stuff that's kinda sensitive to share the tea, so to speak, that's going on at the company so that you have a better idea of what the buying process is, if there's a competitor in place that people don't like, etcetera. I really, really like that nugget. Yeah. It totally breaks the fourth wall of, like, the buyer seller standoff, and it makes it feel like you're on the same side of the table. So number three for me was the concept of parroting their exact words that they wrote or said. The power of a smile. It was a quote that one of Sean's prospects wrote on LinkedIn, and that was the subject line of his email. And that's better than making the subject line smile or powerful smile. He used the exact words the prospect did. And then number four was Sean's approach of sometimes it just needs to be the exact same message sent from a different person. He was talking about collaborating with his SDR. Sometimes they can take the exact same message you came up with, reach out to the same prospect, and that will get a response, and yours won't. And that's okay. So don't be afraid to change the voice if you've got a really compelling and great message when you're reaching out to somebody. Jason, this is normally the part of the show where Armond would ask me how people can help us out, but I'm wondering if you could tell the audience how folks could help us out today. I think the biggest way that you could help us out is by helping yourself. And the number one thing you can do is we literally worked with Gong to pull 300,000,000 plus data points on cold email. So everything from subject lines, how long they should be, does social proof impact emails or not, should you ask for time versus interest in an email, and everything in between. And we created a really badass cold email course that you can grab in the show notes. And you're gonna get everything from frameworks to how to use AI to write emails for you, sequence structure, the blueprint, remove the mystery behind what to say, how to say it, when to say it, how often to say it, etcetera. So, yeah, help us out by helping yourself. Go check out the course. Go check it out. I promise it's really badass. Thanks for listening, folks, and we'll see you next week on the show.
