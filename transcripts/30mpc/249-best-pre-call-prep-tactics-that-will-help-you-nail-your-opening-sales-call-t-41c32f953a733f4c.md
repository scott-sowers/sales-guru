## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to another episode of thirty minutes to presidents club. I'm your host, Nick Sigelski, and I'm joined with my co host, Jen Allen Knutts. And today, we have Taylor Lemke, who is a inside sales account executive at Zapier. Jen, why should people listen? Taylor does a phenomenal job of showing us all the work we can do in advance of the first call to make sure the first call that we have a prospect hits it out of the park. Three, two, one. We hit this episode out of the park. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes.

Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.

Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. My first one is to use a mutual action plan to show all the things you're doing for a customer in order to ask for a give get. Boom. What's number two? Yeah. My second one is to use a glad I caught you. I only have ten minutes before my next meeting as a cold call opener. Like, hey, Nick. I'm really glad I caught you. I actually only have ten minutes until my next meeting. Reason I'm calling is I see you're about halfway through your trial. I've got some ideas to ensure the last half of your trial is successful. Do Do you have ten minutes to chat through some of my ideas to see how we can help? Beautiful. Round us out. What's number three? Three is don't go into an inbound meeting blind. Use a more information needed snippet to quickly qualify or disqualify inbound leads before you get on the call. So, Taylor, you're working this role where you're getting all sorts of inbound pings all the time. And sometimes you're like, oh, actually, that needs to be routed to support. Other times, you're like, oh my gosh. I've got the deal of the century in my lap. Talk to me about the things that you're doing before you meet live with the customer to ensure that meeting is successful. Definitely. This is just a part of my pre call research that I've added as a task. You know, maybe you might get in, like, an inbound call and and the sales form is pretty vague. Maybe you see that a lot of people are being added from, like, different cross functional titles onto a meeting. I'm going into this call pretty blind. What I'm gonna do is, hey, customer. Really, thanks for reaching out. Really excited to meet. Would you mind answering a couple questions for me? This is gonna make sure that I'm providing the best resources to you prior to our conversation. This snippet has a mix of six questions that I'm able to tailor based off of what I'm doing in my pre call research that asks things really to put my customers into a couple different buckets. They've already gone through the process and are highly engaged in Zapier. We're looking to really just go through, like, a pricing conversation. Maybe it's just like a general intake kind of question. This allows me to understand what are some of the features and functions to, like, really prioritize where this deal is potentially going to land and quickly prequalify or quickly disqualify. So you mentioned you have, I think, six or so questions. My guess is you could ask 60 or so questions if you really wanted to. What types of questions are you choosing to ask? I know some of these are specific to your business, but I'm curious how you chose the types of questions you're asking the prospect. Yeah. They are specific to my business, but I think you can definitely replicate this no matter the type of product you're selling. So specific to my role at Zapier, I'm asking what process are you looking to automate? Are you exploring this product for your personal needs or your organization? That's already gonna really help me think. Is this something that they're taking on for their team, or they, you know, just go about exploring it for another area of the business? I wanna know things about what are they currently using, what are some of the things in terms of an ideal timeline for an ideal solution when it would be put in place. Also, asking a couple qualifying questions in terms of any plans that they're already evaluating. I imagine there are times that you get a response to that email, and the customer is clearly looking for something that you, Taylor, are not gonna be able to deliver. What I mean by that is they're asking for things that you know you're gonna need a subject matter expert on involve or a technical resource involved in. And I don't know if that's something that your business always will do. So what do you do when the customer is like, oh, we need to go over these eight things, and you're like, no. I don't know the answer to any of those. That's why precall research is so important. And just to be able to ask these questions, that's why you can go in internally. Maybe start asking a couple of your internal stakeholders, loop in a solutions engineer if you have access to that, go into that call with a little bit of research done on your half. But I think it's about meeting the customer, like, also making sure they're meeting you where you're at. I wanna go into this discovery call and just understand if there's a business challenge even to solve and if Zapier could be the right fit. So I would say even if I go into that meeting and don't have all the right answers, that's a really great way to position a next step to be able to get all the qualifying information in that first conversation to then loop in a subject matter expert. But just asking the questions and providing that snippet prior, you're already starting to pinpoint and, like, put the puzzle pieces together of, hey. This is gonna be a pretty technical evaluation. So in that meeting, I'm gonna wanna make sure I understand, does this meet my internal threshold to be able to request a solutions engineer? Do they already know who is going to be the executive buyer on this deal, and do they have access? If so, chances are I can start pulling some more strings internally. If they haven't thought through some of those questions, it may just not be qualified enough for me to go out of my way to even ask those questions to those really technical questions that they're expecting need to have the answers for. So today's Monday. Let's say you get an inbound lead, Taylor, and the call is for Friday. At what point are you sending those six questions, and what do you do if, let's say, it's Thursday or Wednesday and they still haven't responded? Great plug for Zapier. I have this process automated. So I'm getting notifications when someone books time on my calendar, and I'm already knowing and having a really good idea of what they're expecting to go into this call. But if I see that automation comes through and their form comes through and it's pretty vague, I'm gonna hope that they have a phone number or I'm gonna go and source that phone number and try to get them on the phone. If I don't get an answer, I think that also just helps me making sure I go into that conversation and I ask these snippet questions at the top of the meeting and go into my usual discovery question cadence. Taylor, I freaking love that because you're right. You talked about this world where you've got a meeting and other people from the customer's organization getting added to the invite. You get all of those notifications. And to your point earlier, if you go in blind, even if you get responses to that questionnaire that you send in advance, there might be six other people, and you're like, I don't know why you all are here. And one of my favorite plays to run has been what you just described, which is I want to try to single thread with every single person who's in the deal. And so anytime I have an invite with multiple people on it, and I haven't spoken to some of those people, I'm doing exactly what you just described, which is find everybody's phone number and call them and say something like, hey, Jen. I saw you just got added to the meeting that I have with Taylor on Friday. I know you and I haven't met, but I wanted to see. I'm doing some prep. Is there anything in particular you would really like to have us cover or address in our meeting together there? And nine times out of 10, Jen just gushes words describing everything that she wants out of that meeting, and I get to have many discovery calls with every single person. So what you're doing is so smart because you have such a technical and sometimes creative sale. Anything that you can do to understand their situation before that first meeting is so helpful for you. So on that same vein, Taylor, outside of the questions that they're asking or they're answering, what other steps are you taking in terms of pre meeting prep to prepare yourself for a really solid discovery conversation? I think the three by three when you're prospecting can be replicated in your pre call research. Take three minutes, find three different things, whether that be what is the current active usage of their account across Zapier right now? What are some of the applications that they're using and integrating in Zapier? What are some of the certain teams so I can see if this is potentially a cross functional type of play? Looking to see areas of active usage. I'm also going on LinkedIn. I'm using Sales Nav to my advantage. I'm also using a lot of AI to help as well. Another plug for Zapier, I've got a bot set up that helps based off of their demo form and based off of research that AI is doing, help me formulate a couple of really good discovery questions that's tailored based off of current account usage and based off of what their demo form intake says. Can you tell me more about that? Absolutely. So we have got an integration with AI essentially every time that I've got a meeting booked on my calendar between HubSpot, between looking at some of the information that we have internal tools and internal systems. It's really just like an automation that aggregates all this information into one. I get a notification in Slack, and I'm able to start my pre call research process there. At that point, when I see that message come through with some of that pre call research help, that's where I'm able to see, hey. I'm gonna go into this call pretty blind. Right? I didn't get as much information needed likely just due to the fact that maybe there's no usage on the account. Maybe they just had a really vague sales form. I'm gonna go and send this snippet out to them. Maybe I found that I saw that a bunch of, like, high c suite level people are on the call. Right? They're starting to invite a lot of people onto this meeting, but I saw in their demo form that they're looking for, like, a general intake. But maybe they booked the meeting, like, two weeks out. I'm gonna say, hey. This seems like a really great opportunity. Let me reach out to them, see what they're interested in, and let me try to pull that meeting in a little bit sooner. Why wait two weeks? It's just like a really good leverage point based off of how I have my process today to, again, put all of my different prospects into different buckets to quickly DQ or to quickly qualify. So one of the things I love that's coming through in your approach is that you are so mindful about the value of your prospects' time on that first conversation. I think we all know the most frustrating thing we can do in a first call is ask people to fill something out or share something with us, only to ask it again when we first get them on the phone. So can you talk to us about your process for taking all that information, both the snippet that they filled out, the discovery that you do, and then how you actually open that first conversation? Because Because I think it'd be really interesting to hear how you're doing that as opposed to someone who's just like, hey. Why'd you reach out today? Yeah. I love the purpose process payoff. I'm not sure if it's a methodology, but the purpose process payoff agenda opener in all of my meetings. So this is where I'm taking all of the pre call research that I've done and saying, the purpose of today is x, y, and z. What I wanna cover today is x, y, and z. And then by the end of this call, we should have full clarity on x, y, and z. So based off of my pre call research, that's where I'm filling in that template. So, you know, the purpose of today, I saw in your demo form that you're interested in automating these two different solutions. What I wanna cover today is the business reason behind that. I'd love to learn if there's a project or an initiative that's driving this and what are the business challenges of why you're here wanting to evaluate Zapier today. So by the end of this call, we should have full clarity on if Zapier is the right solution for solving your business challenge, and we should be able to walk through the various ways. Similar organizations to yours are going through a full evaluation of Zapier. I love that agenda because you're making it very clear to the customer that you are trying to understand the business reason for them making a change. And I talked to so many salespeople that they come up with these convoluted discovery questions to try to uncover the business reason versus you're just stating that's the purpose of what I'm trying to get out of this call. And when you tell the customer where you want to end up, which is what you're doing in your agenda, you don't need to have this fancy, triple, humbling disclaimer, accusation, audit question. They'll just take you there most of the time. I'm curious about what that looks like when you get into the conversation and how you flush your discovery out a bit. I think it's different depending on the situation. Are they familiar with Zapier? Are they using us currently versus not? I wanna learn if there is a specific project that is tied to their role, or are they supporting some initiative just around automation across maybe a couple of different cross functional teams? I wanna uncover how have they tried to fix this. Are you currently trying to fix this already? What other solutions are you evaluating to try and fix this? And of those attempts to try and fix this problem, why haven't they been successful? I I think by starting to go through a couple of my different cadences of questions, that really helps me land on a couple of different things. Like, how big is the problem? How qualified is it in terms of this being a true business challenge to solve for? Well, I actually wanna hone in on something you said, Taylor, which is the idea of, like, starting to quantify the problem. And I'm curious how you go about doing that on these first calls. I think going into your call knowing, like, what's the minimum criteria that you need to exit that meeting to be able to do exactly what you said. By the end of this call, we should have full clarity on if we're going through an evaluation or not. I'm doing some things to try and uncover. Is this a certain project or initiative that this is tied to? Is this something that you're trying to solve for your own individual needs, or is this something that's supporting a couple different cross functional teams as well? Why are you looking to solve this, and why are you looking at Zapier? That's when I can start getting into some of those requirements. That's where I'm able to really get into the technical side of things to really say by the end of the call, hey. I heard that you listed off these requirements. We're actually not the right solution for you. Or I heard that this is a true business challenge. You've made attempts. You're looking for a no code solution. And based off of a couple of other different requirements that align to some of our features and functions, do I have permission to open up and talk to you about some of our different plans? Can you explain to me why you ask for permission? I think it's a really smart nuance, and I wanna hear your rationale rationale behind it. When you ask for permission, I find it opens up the floodgates for your customer either to say, no. Can you answer a couple of more questions for me? And then you can ask for permission again. Or it opens up and the prospect says, absolutely. These are the reasons why I think this is gonna be a good solution. Then you can dig in even more and ask more discovery questions based off of what they're excited about. So you get to the end of that conversation. Right? You've done all this great ton of ton of information. And I'm also hearing that it could be different roles, different levels of seniority. So before we get too deep into mutual action plans, maybe just help us understand first and foremost, why do you use them and what is your goal behind a mutual action plan coming out of that conversation? Why I use a mutual action plan is that it's an opportunity for me to always be qualifying my deals. It's an opportunity where we always want to be testing our champions, and it's a way for me to be a super sharp seller and know exactly where my deals are and what are the missing puzzle pieces for me to be able to prioritize a deal and move a deal from one stage, one category to the next. And then how do you introduce it to the buyer? Because I would say, like, I think sometimes where we get tripped up is it's like, here's a bunch of homework. Will you do it for me? So how do you make it a win for the buyer as much as it is a win for you? I introduce this to my champion before I introduce it to the buyer. Reason for that being, it's a way for me to test my champion, but it's a way for me to make my champion look really good to their boss who is more than likely the buyer. It's an opportunity I go through and say, hey. Customers typically go about evaluating us like this. I've put together a brief project plan or a mutual action plan. I'd love to find fifteen minutes for you to make sure that this process aligns with yours. I put in a couple of ideas of some due dates for us to work back from the go live timeline that we discussed. Could you help me understand what are the some internal tasks and milestones you need to accomplish us moving into the next step and make sure that we have a milestone owner for each one of these tasks? So, Taylor, what are some of the things that go into a typical mutual action plan for you? Typical things that go into it are thinking of internally, what are the different things that I know I'm gonna need in order to know that this is a qualified deal? Also, what are the things that my champion are more than likely not thinking of? When I'm going into this, I think it's replicable no matter the type of segment you're selling in. But I'm thinking some of those really large enterprise deals that have a lot of different steps to them, your champion may know that they're gonna need to open up a ticket with your procurement team to start the security, the legal, the finance review, but they may not know who are all the people and what are all the different tasks associated with each of those steps. So what goes into this mutual action plan is everything from the first conversation all the way to a signature and a go live date of when they're building their first Zap. So things like procurement process has kicked off with a due date and a milestone owner, questions about that. When I'm in my mutual action plan review meeting with my champion, I'm asking things along the lines of, hey. What does a typical security review process look like? Is there gonna be a questionnaire we have to fill out? Is Johnny in IT the only person that needs to review our answers? If so, about how long does that typically take? Awesome. What does that turnaround time typically look like? I'm really meticulous of thinking through all the different things to one, be able to coach my champion. But, two, also when it comes down to what I talked about a little bit ago, are those give gets. For me to be able to highlight, absolutely, we can go ahead and provide you this information for your CFO to review. But what I'm gonna need in return is to ensure that your legal team has reviewed our terms of service for the reason that those are something that we're maybe not able to edit. Or if red lines do come through, there's some internal review processes that are gonna add an additional two weeks to our timeline, and that's gonna throw things off. It's a way for me to be really honest with my champion and make sure that we have all the tasks associated to be able to continue with the timeline that we've previously agreed on. So I'm really curious about something. So I'm gonna ask you a what happens when question because I think sometimes I've certainly run up against this in deals, in enterprise deals where you're working with a really large organization. What do you do when your champion is just really struggling to give you answers? So if they're like, I don't know. I've never bought something like this before. How do you handle that such that you're not just like, okay, send me to the person that can answer the questions? I think it's a delicate dance. And based on the way that you've described every other answer, you've got a really thoughtful approach. So I'm really curious for how you handle it. I think this sounds really apparent in your initial qualification. Right? That's something I'm asking in all of my discovery questions. Hey, customer. Have you ever gone through the purchasing process at your organization, and can you walk me through what that typically looks like after this conversation to start those conversations? If they don't have an answer to that, chances are they know who does, and I try to really quickly get introduced to that person. If you're waiting to ask those questions when you're reviewing the project plan, chances are you just don't have a champion, so we need to go and and source who that person is. So I think it'd be, like, super transparent or I think it'd be super fair to ask your prospect in those situations to say, hey. In order to move forward, I really wanna, like, work with you and understand owning this from an admin permissioning standpoint. Maybe then that opens up the floodgate that actually IT needs to open this new tool. Hey, champion. Have any of your colleagues ever gone through the process of purchasing software before? Maybe they'll be able to make an introduction over there, or that's also a really great time for them to say, I know my boss has permission to do this. Why don't I loop my boss into this conversation? What I'd be happy to do for you doing that in return is I'm happy to loop my manager into that conversation as well for us to figure this out together. What happens when your champion suddenly leaves the organization and you're at the stage of you've already started working on a map, but they had a lot of the next step ownership? What do you do in those situations? In my pre call research, I'm hoping to already start that process of multithreading. So whether that be we know in every single deal, there's multiple decision makers. Right? So do I know that their boss is clued into this, and do I know who that is after doing some sales nav research? What if that happens? How qualified is the deal as well? If we haven't identified that there's an actual initiative to solve for this problem, I maybe just didn't have a true deal on my hands. If that's the case, I'm gonna make sure I put a task on my to do list to check-in another month, another three, another six months to see, has anybody taken their place? Has any more active usage happened on their account to see if maybe somebody's replaced them? I'm also gonna make sure I have sales and ad notifications turned on. Continuously check-in. Is somebody gonna replace them? And can I reach out and say, hey? If I did have true pain that was associated and a real deal on my hands, I think that's the perfect opportunity for me to then start doing some cold outreach and say, hey. I was working with someone who was previously at the organization. They shared, you know, in a couple quick snippets that they're experiencing this pain, this challenge, and this is the business impact that's associated with that. Does this seem like something you'd be interested in continuing the conversation about? If not, would you mind making a recommendation of who's taken over for them or maybe somebody else at the organization that could help out? Okay. So you talked about, Taylor, you're putting this to do item to make sure that you check the usage of the account and follow-up with the person or attempt to break into the org the other way, and it's making me think about just how process driven you actually are. You were talking to me about this pre meeting snippet that you send and how you have a standardized template for your sales notes even. Talk to me about almost your personal operating system. How do you make sure that you're staying on top of all of the things that you have to do to actually hit your quota? Yeah. It didn't come overnight. It came from moving from a really outbound motion to now in a high velocity inbound motion that I'm in today. I'm contact switching a lot throughout the day. So the more I can templatize all of my processes, the better I can be in terms of getting back to customers sooner. I can better be to context switch when that customer reaches back out to me or we have our next follow-up meeting on the calendar. Walking you through what my process looks like, it looks like I'm setting up a lot of automations for myself for any time a new business meeting is on my calendar. I'm doing that pre call research. I'm quickly sending out that snippet if there's more information that I need. I have a notes document that I use for every customer. I have a task after every meeting that's already prepopulized for me to be able to make sure I send a follow-up email to all of my customers to cover what we covered in the call and to make sure that I have outlined what our next steps are. For every single open deal that I have in my pipeline, I have a task associated with that. For every closed loss deal that I think is not a complete closed loss, but is maybe a forward thinking deal, I have a task for me to check-in with them in about three months. Couple of other different processes that I'm automating would just be a lot of what are the go to questions that customers are constantly asking me. Land me to your pricing page. Can you send over your terms of service? Can you share your data processing addendum with me? These are all snippets that I have. There's a lot of different tools out there between outreach snippets, between a lot of other different tools out there. Maybe you have just like a keyboard shortcut that you have. It just helps to make sure you've covered your basis and you're asking all the right questions, but also just make sure you're so much more effective and efficient with your time to templatize the processes that you're just seeing come up often on the day to day. I wanna ask you, Taylor, about sometimes we have these great first meetings with customers, and they've got a big business initiative, and things go great. And you get a next step on the books, and then they don't show up. Or they say, oh, I'll send over some times. I get a jet, and they leave the Zoom. And you're like, okay. I guess I'm gonna follow-up. Talk to me about how you manage staying on top of deals that you need to push forward that don't always have a clear next step on the books. When I don't have a clear next step on the books, I usually equate that to it's probably not as much of a qualified deal that I originally thought it was. So what do I wanna do? I probably wanna reach out to them and ask a couple more qualifying questions. That's gonna really help me put them into a couple different buckets. Do I need to send some follow-up resources that help them learn a little bit more about what Zapier is and suggest, hey. After you're able to look at this prerecorded demo that we have, let me know if it still makes sense for us to connect. I'm also not opposed to sending some blind calendar invites. Those have only gotten me in trouble a couple of times. If it's a qualified deal and someone that is gonna be interested in that next steps, sometimes those prospects really appreciate the fact that you just put something blind on there. So what I do to actually go about that in a respectful way, hey, Nick. I know we got cut off our first meeting, and there were a couple of different things we talked about as a next step. Went ahead and put us on for fifteen minutes at that same time here in next week. Let me know if you can't make it. Happy to adjust. If it does work, here's my agenda for this conversation. These were the three things that we weren't able to cover. I'd really like to center around these three different questions in that next conversation. Looking forward to it. Oh, man. Taylor, I could ask you this stuff all day, but we are running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. And so the last question is, what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Some of the best sales advice I've ever received early on in my career is ask for forgiveness, not permission. I see so many reps, myself included, at times to slow their deals down due to lack of confidence or just trusting their knowledge or abilities. I think it hurts you more than it helps you for those reasons. You learn by doing in some of the sharpest enterprise and major account executives I've worked with in the past take ownership of their work. We have approval process for a reason. You don't always have to wait for your one on one or a deal review to ask questions. Trust yourself enough to really soar and not get in your own way. The worst thing that could happen is you get a no, but the best thing that can happen is you trust yourself, you progress your deal, and it moves you a lot faster and more efficiently because you went for it and didn't ask for permission. Boom. I love it. Taylor, thank you for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Your top four actionable takeaways from this episode with Taylor Lemke is number one, do not go in blind to an inbound lead meeting. Before that meeting, reach out to the folks who books the meeting with you and give them a pre meeting questionnaire. If you can get answers to this stuff, it will make for a far more productive introductory conversation with the customer. Number two, if you've got a good opportunity where you've just been struggling to get back on the calendar, it's alright to send the prospect a blind calendar invite, AKA put something on their calendar so long as you put some context in that calendar invite. It might sound like, hey, Jen. I know we wanted to meet to discuss a, b, and c. If this time works for you, let me know. If not, no problem. Just decline the invite and let me know a better time that might work for you. Hoping to hear from you soon, Nick. Number three, use Taylor's purpose plan payoff opener to ensure a strong start to your first call with the buyer. Purpose is why are we here. Plan, how are we going to achieve it. Payoff, what's in it for the buyer at the end of the meeting. And number four, my favorite, separate interest from need by quantifying the problem. Taylor shared questions like, is there a specific business objective this maps back to? How have you currently tried to fix this? What else are you trying to do to fix the problem? What works and what hasn't? This will give you a much better idea of whether the prospect is simply interested or if there's a true need behind why they're reaching out. Nick, how can listeners help us out today? Well, did you know that we actually write down the stuff that we learn on thirty minutes to presidents club, including this episode? And we occasionally email out all of the learnings that we've had from all of thirty MPC in an easy to understand newsletter format. And if you're interested in getting the thirty MPC newsletter, I promise I won't send you a blind calendar invite. Don't worry about that. You can sign up at the link in the show notes. I promise you it's the great thirty MPC goodness, but you can read it in my voice as opposed to having to hear my voice. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
