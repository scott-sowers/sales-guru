## Transcript

You're making a cold call and your prospect says, I'm using a competitor. Well, guess what? This is when most sellers absolutely throw the cold call in the trash because the worst thing that you can do right now is tell your prospect all of the reasons why that competitor is not good and all the reasons why your product is good. The reality is your prospect bought that product in the first place for a reason. In other words, they made an intentional decision to use a product that was not yours. And so when you try to handle the competition by pitching your product over them, you actually make your prospect more defensive because you're essentially saying the decision that you made was wrong, make this better decision. And if you've ever had someone try to convince you of something, nine times out of 10, you tend to get pretty defensive unless they first understand why you made that decision in the first place. And that's exactly how we're going to handle any competitive objection when it comes to the cold calling world. We're gonna go through three steps to handle any competitor objection you could possibly get on a cold call, and we'll go through three different product examples so you know that this works in different environments. And we'll do all of this using what I call the mister Miyagi method to handle any objection in the world of which there are three steps. You need to agree with the objection before you handle the objection as step one. You then need to incentivize conversation. In other words, you need to get them talking more about the objection to give you more information about the objection and also to get them comfortable. And then lastly, number three, you need to sell the test drive, not the car. In other words, you need to answer the question, what are they going to get out of a meeting with you even if they never bought the car in the first place? Alrighty? So let's go through these three examples one by one, and we'll walk through the framework and the talk track step by step. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. So this first example is using, software that I actually used to sell when I was the VP of sales at a company called Pave. So I led them from a 100 k to $12,000,000 plus, and one thing that we never struggled with is our team was always really, really, really, really good at generating pipelines specifically on the phones. And so we were selling into a space where a lot of times people would have an existing compensation planning solution. So if we were making a cold call, we would go through our opener, we would go through our pitch, and nine times out of 10 they would say something like, hey, we're using CompX, which was just like one of our competitors in the space. Step number one of the mister Miyagi method is the most horrible thing I could possibly do with that objection is I start to fight or try to, like, handle compacts as the competitor. Instead, what I wanna do is I actually wanna, like, like, agree with the objection in this case. I'm gonna say something that completely disarms the prospect of any sort of sales pitch whatsoever. So I might say, John, I totally get it. Honestly, I should have assumed that you had a tool in place, and nine times out of 10, it doesn't make sense to switch off of a tool, let alone one like CompX. The moment I say that, the prospect is like, what the hell? Like, what this person not gonna pitch me? I'm like, I thought I was gonna kick them away as a salesperson, but I guess they're just, like, laying down. Is that the end of it? And immediately what you do is you release some of that sales pressure that oftentimes happens on a cold call. Step number two is you wanna incentivize conversation with what we call a trap question. In other words, I wanna do two things with a little bit of finesse. Number one, I wanna ask them a question that gets them talking, but then two, I wanna ask them a question that exposes a hole in their existing solution, but it sort of like lets them come to the answer on their own terms. If I just said, hey, you can't do this, they're gonna push back. But if I'm like, hey, how do you do this thing that I know you can't do? You might almost like stumble upon the answer yourself, and then I can take you the rest of the way. So for example, we were a compensation planning software that would allow people to run promotion cycles, and there are usually two types of compensation increases you can get. You can get cash based comp increases, which are like, here's a 10% salary raise, or you can get equity based compensation increases. Here's, like, a a 100 new stock options or something like that. And what we knew about the space is the key to handling any competitor is you gotta remember, like, the one thing that you do that this bucket of competitors doesn't do. So CompX was one of these legacy competitors that was really good at, like, cash planning and reporting and, like, advanced permissions and all this stuff, but they actually couldn't handle stock option planning or equity planning at all. And so you had to do that in a different software. And so I'm just gonna ask a trap question about that. So after I agreed with the objection, I might say something like, hey. Just so no one from my team calls you again, you must not be doing any sort of, like, stock option bonuses in your merit cycles. Right? And notice there are two parts of that. Number one is I said, just so my team doesn't call you again, I'm giving them a reason to give me an answer. No one wants more cold calls. And then I like pushed away and I'm like, hey, you're probably not doing any like stock option planning. Right? And if I was smart at Pave, I was was calling in the companies that I knew were doing stock option planning. So if I was calling a startup, like, they were probably doing equity grants. And so usually you'd get an answer at this point that would sound something like, we are. Why do you ask? And now they're taking a step forward. I piqued the curiosity, and now they're open to listening a little bit because we've turned, like, the initial confrontation of a cold call into a little bit more of, like, a conversation because there's some back and forth. And now this is where salespeople, like, they'll oftentimes, like, throw it in the trash. They're like, alright. It's time to pitch. And it's like, no. It's not time to pitch yet. You're gonna pitch on the meeting after you ask them a bunch of questions and you get them talking even more. The goal is to get them to, like, sit in the car. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. You're not trying to sell the car. You're not trying to get them to, like, get rid of their car right now. You're just trying to get them to sit in the test drive. So they've taken that step forward, and the final synchro line that I'm going to use is, again, I'm going to push away a little bit. This this might actually make sense. My guess is you're probably going to stay with CompX, but we've had a couple of customers switch from CompX to us specifically because stock option planning can be really, really challenging twice a year. And if your managers can't see the stock option bonuses next to the cash bonuses, they'll oftentimes ask for, like, a bigger cash increase because they're looking at, like, comp in a silo. My guess is you're probably not gonna change, but would you be open to taking a look at this thing? Not for now, but just so you know it's out there. And so notice, like, there are a couple things going on there. Number one, like, I exposed and I expanded the hole in their current solution. And I said, like, hey, here's what other customers have seen. Not here's what I think is better. Here's what other customers like you noticed when they had this problem too. And then from there, you can be like, do you wanna, like, take a look at this thing knowing that you're probably not gonna buy it anyway? Like, you wanna remove all the pressure of the sale because no one's gonna buy something from you on a cold call unless you're like, I don't know, selling a a non stick pan for a $100. You have to do like a one call close or something like that. The goal is for them to take like one step forward, and the way you get them to take one step forward is you remove all the pressure on the sale and you make them comfortable. Most people have like some form of gym membership, even if that means you like go to a park and do pull ups. Like people have some existing solution in place. Let's say that I sell for Equinox. Okay. So I'm gonna sell like a premium solution. I know someone is at Planet Fitness, $13 a month or something like that with purple stuff and dumbbells that only go to 15 pounds. Whatever it is. So step number one is I'm gonna agree with the objection. Honestly, John, I probably should have assumed that you had another membership. You seem like you're in pretty good shape and you take your fitness seriously. So my guess is if you've gotten into a routine, you're probably not gonna switch. Agree. Now all the sales pressure is removed. Now all I need to think is like what's one thing that Planet Fitness members don't have that Equinox does have? Well, there's a lot and it's obviously more expensive. Well, I can think of two things. Well, number one, Planet Fitness dumbbells only go up to like, 60 pounds or something like that. So if you're, like, actually in shape, like, you look, chances are you gotta do, like, a million reps at 60 pounds of your bench or your goblet squat or something like that to get any sort of pumps. So, like, that's one direction. The other direction, number two, is that, like, they don't have any, like, sauna or or anything like that. So if you like to do that, you have to, like, go to, like, a separate sauna from your gym, which is, like, honestly a pain in the butt. And if I'm, like, talking to someone who has money to pay, like, I can expose that hole. And so the way I'm gonna do that is I'm gonna do that same incentivized conversation. I'm gonna, like, push away It'll be like, just so I make sure, like, no one from my team calls you again. You must not be a huge sauna guy or, like, you must not be doing any, like, super heavy compound barbell or dumbbell lifts over, like, 60 pounds, give or take. Now in the gym world, this person might be like, dude, are you kidding me? Like, I don't even lift. At which point, I've poked the bear a little bit, and I'm, like, probably a little bit happy that I got the person pissed that I basically said, you don't even lift. But chances are if I drop, like, one or two of those little trap nuggets in, they're gonna be like, I like the sauna or I, you know, I want the heavier weights, but it's just like it's just a little bit too expensive. Right? And so like what I'm hearing at that point is I would rather have your product, it's just too expensive. And so now it's just a matter of like sizing up that value. K? And the best time to have that negotiation is when they're like riding the thrill of the roller coaster of like being in an equinox and, like, doing stupid eucalyptus towels on the face and they're, like, oh my god. I feel so good. And so all I gotta do is, like, I just gotta get them in the gym. The way I'm gonna sell the test drive is I'm gonna say, like, honestly, John, that totally makes sense. I figured you'd be doing, like, heavier compound movements. You probably just have to do more reps at Planet Fitness. But the reality is, like, Equinox is gonna be, like, way more expensive, but we can work stuff out with you. That said, I don't even know if that's gonna be worth it for you. And I was looking at my records, and I I don't think you've ever actually tried the gym. We can work something out, but, like, why don't you just come and, like, try a workout in the first place? Get in the sauna, try the heavier weights, and, like, see what it does for your workout. If nothing else, you'll know what's out there and you'll be like, okay, like I know that's not worth it. And then if you find that it's worth it, like maybe we could talk about something. So you wanna swing by for a free workout next week? I'll be like, cool, take the free workout. And then once he gets in the gym, then I can catch him with the eucalyptus towel on the face and give him a smoothie and all that stuff and then be like, okay. Pay my $300 per month. Alright? So that's gym memberships. And again, the key premise here is, like, I gotta know one thing that I'm gonna poke in that competitor and then I'm gonna use that to get them in the gym, get them in the cart, get them in the demo, whatever it is, and that's when I put on the sale. So this last bucket is a company that I do some sales coaching for, and it's an AI resume screener. In other words, if you have like 3,000 resumes in a stack, it's like the most mind numbing exercise in the world to try to find the five candidates who are actually qualified for the job, and so you end up having to have, like, the sourcer go and, like, look through a million different resumes, and it's a huge pain in the butt. Problem is a lot of times people have what's called an ATS or an applicant tracking system. It's like a CRM for candidates in the recruiting world. And some ATS platforms have built in candidate screening bots, but they, like, kind of suck. They're basically, like, glorified filters you can apply, which is, like, x years of experience, this location. It's not actually, like, using AI to, like, read a resume like a human could. So it can't point out certain nuances, like, oh, I want someone who got, like, three promotions in two years. So they have, like, a quick trajectory. And that's something that this company, Covey, does. K? And so that's gonna be my trap question. And so I have to do a little bit more research for a prospect like this because I need to know enough about their company to be able to say something nuanced that they would be looking for. Otherwise, like, my trap question is gonna be too generic. Okay? So let's assume that I'm reaching out to the VP of marketing over at Gong, and they're a sales tech company. And I wanna be able to point out the purple squirrel for them, that funky candidate who has, like, both marketing experience and either worked in sales or worked in sales tech. So they might say something like, hey. Look, Arman, I I really appreciate the call, but we have an all in one platform where our ATS actually has, like, a recruiting bot attached to it, and it's it's fine. And so I think we're good. So I'm gonna say, like, totally get it. Honestly, most ATS platforms, like, have a bot the other day, so I should have assumed that you were already, like, using one of those. And nine times out of 10, like, it usually gets the job done. He's like, where'd the pitch go? Now I incentivize conversation, and I'm gonna use that trap question. Hey. Just so no one calls you from my team again, I I was looking at some of the open rules you have, and you're hiring a lot of marketers who have, like, sales experience or worked in sales tech. I have to assume that those bots are able to, like, catch that nuance of, like, a marketer who worked in sales or worked in sales tech. Like, is it able to get to, like, that level of human level nuance? And they'll be like, we we get it to, like, 300 out of the 3,000 applications, and then our recruiters are usually the ones who look through that. I'm like, oh, got it. We've talked to a bunch of other companies that are similar to you where, like, they're looking for certain industry experience or maybe they're looking for types of people who have, like, quick trajectory. So they wanna see, like, four promotions in two years, and that stuff is, like, really, really, really hard to find if you don't have a tool that is, like, solely focused on reading resumes and pulling out human level nuance. My guess is you're probably not gonna switch because it would be another tool in your stack. But could I actually just, like, show you what this looks like for one of your open marketing roles? Not for now, but, like, just so you know what's out there. And then I can get on the call and be like, hey. Here are these 3,000 resumes. Here are the 10 that have sales experience. Blow your mind. Awesome. Let's talk about how much time that would save your sources. Let's talk about how much value that would bring your team, how much it would cost, how much of a discount you'd get off your ATS if you didn't have that tool anymore. And then I can sell them on the rip and replace, but that only happens if I can get them in the car. Alrighty, folks. So to recap, we had three examples, the compensation software, the gym memberships, and the AI resume screener. And we went through the three steps, agree with the objection, incentivize conversation, and then selling the test drive, not the car. If you like this, folks, there are a bunch of other videos that I've covered on different objections. That's one. And we've also put together a free toolkit that has scripts for 18 of the most common objections in sales from not interested to send me some information to call me in six months to competitive objections. And so you can access all of those scripts here or down in the show notes as well. And then if you like this, folks, I have two requests. Number one, if you could like and subscribe this page, it would mean a a ton. It is the number one way that this channel continues to grow, and that is what ultimately allows us to do more content. And then number two, if you really like this, the ultimate step to booking one and three cold calls is to take our cold calling course, and that breaks down the entire cold call step by step with talk tracks and examples just like this in far more detail that I went through today. Everything from the opener to the pitch, to the objections, to how you manage your day, to how to, like, maximize the number of conversations you get in an hour even when you're not on the phones. It is the ultimate step by step guide to booking meetings on the phone. And the best feeling in the world, folks, is literally being able to walk into a cold call blitz and know that you are going to leave after one hour with one meeting on the books every single time. So a link to that is here. There's also a discount code because you're on this video. You can go access all that stuff down in the show notes, and, let us know down in the notes what objection you'd want us to handle next. Alrighty, folks. Peace out.
