## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this special leadership episode focused on all things founder led sales. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my cohost, Mark Cosco. And today, we have the the grandfather, the legend of founder led sales. He is the one and only Pete Kazanji. He is the author of founding sales, the early stage go to market handbook. He is the founder and CEO over at Atrium, and he is also the founder of Modern Sales Pros. And if you want to be a founder one day, if you're doing early stage sales, or if you just wanna know what it is like to sell your first customers as a founder, this is the one for you. Mark, why should people listen? I think he nailed it, man. Pete Kazinji has done more in the startup world than hardly than almost anybody I've I've ever met. He he knows everybody. He's connected to everybody, and he's done it twice. This is his second startup. It's gaining momentum. It's doing its thing, and I think there's a lot to learn. Alrighty, Pete. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership or in this case, through lead sales takeaways. Let's get your three. Yeah. So first takeaway and tip is on prospecting for your first customers. Like, we're gonna be talking about all founder led selling things here. First tip is on prospecting, identifying your ICP of your organizations you should be going after and the humans within it. Gotta make sure we're targeting accounts that have the problem that we solve. So being very crisp around identifying organizations based on the size of them, maybe the type of technologies that they have in play that we know are indicative of the problems that we solve. And then importantly, who are the humans within those organizations that we should be engaging? Then the second component of that is the outbound communication to then get in contact with those contacts. So messaging that out, identified you for these reasons right here. These are the characteristics that made me think that you have this challenge that we're potentially are thinking about solving. I'm doing some research on this right now. Would you be open to chatting with me? We landed our first meeting. What's number two? Cool. Now we gotta talk about interviewing them. Right? Getting information out of the out of the prospect. You wanna have a deck that guides the conversation. The first thing you wanna start out with is, do you have this problem that we are thinking about solving? Right? Then get to the magnitude of that problem. Like, easy way of doing it is scale one to five because if you want them to be able to say, yeah. I have this problem, but it's not that big of a problem. You want people who have really the big problems. Then the thing we wanna figure out is how are you solving this problem right now, and then how happy are you with that right now. And then what you can do is you can pivot to, great. Here's how we're thinking about solving this. Let me go ahead and tell you about that. What are your reactions to that? How appealing does that sound on a scale of one to five? If you just have those basics, you're gonna get really good information out of your customer interviews. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alrighty. So you're getting fours, you're getting fives. It's going well. Bring us takeaway number three. Well, if we're getting fours, we're getting fives. People say, man, I really have this problem. Like, my current solutions are really not getting it done. Then what we wanna do is we wanna go after the close. And so that close might be, hey. Would you like to be a beta customer for us? But if it turns out that we have a bunch of people who have really high pain points associated with this, the close could be for a sale. Right? Okay. We have a number of pilot customers. We have a couple openings for more. So if you're interested in that, we could talk about that. Then you might end up in your customer interviews with a half dozen or a dozen pilot customers giving you $50,000. But, again, it's a read option off of the magnitude of their pain. How do you entice people into those conversations? Because everybody's busy, man. Nobody wants to hear another startup idea. I think there's two things. One, you can maybe by doing content production and kind of community associated with whatever the category of thing is that you're attacking. So that's one way you can go about it. Maybe there's already, like, a bunch of content and community in, like, the market that you're going after, in which case, you just gotta figure out how to get in get into the organizations. Like, you gotta show up in and, like, we were saying in the the outreach component earlier, hey. I'm the founder of x y z. I specifically targeted you because I saw that your company had this characteristic, and you have this characteristic right here. I am doing research on this problem that I think you may have unless I'm crazy. So you put those two things together where this is the founder of x y z. They were obviously very thoughtful in identifying me. They are using the words that actually resonate with me because they've done these interviews, and so they're talking my language here. And the only thing that they're doing is, like, a thirty minute interview with me. This isn't gonna feel like a huge sales pitch. Okay. I'd be open to that. But if you gotta have all of those things coming together in order to get a meeting on the calendar. So the three or four parts of it that you had were, I noticed this and this about you. Here's the problem that I'm working on solution that I'm having in the market, and then the ask for an interview. What is the best thing to put in that first bucket of I noticed this and this value? It would be whatever is correlated to the problem that you're solving. So, like, I'll use Adrian as an example. Hey, mister CRO. Hey, miss CRO. Based on my LinkedIn research, it looks like you have 20 managers over there. That's a lot of people to wrangle. If you're like any of the CROs that I've talked to recently, I imagine that getting all those managers to manage in a consistent fashion to drive high performance on those teams is something that maybe is making you pull your hair out. I'm doing some research on how to help sales leaders drive more consistency in their managerial process, specifically around performance management and what have you. We have some ideas, but, obviously, we'd like your feedback on this. Would you be open to a thirty minute interview with me? The thing that I wanna call out for everyone is the number one thing that you're leading with is I noticed you're this type of person with these types of traits that have this type of problem. Nothing about that is about your solution yet. And this is probably the most common thing that I find myself correcting when I'm working with folks on the early stage of selling is oftentimes they're leading with features, they're leading with product, they're leading with, hey. We're three founders from Wharton or MIT or whatever it is. And don't get me wrong. That stuff can go in the signature. It can go at the bottom of the solution. But until you've established problem and gotten someone to sit up and be like, oh, this person actually knows something about my business. They speak my language. The solution sounds like a massive nothing burger to them. And so you do this initial outreach, and let's say that you reach out to a 100 CFOs or a 100 CROs, and you book ten, fifteen meetings, however many meetings. It'd be great if you booked at least 10. You take those first calls. What do you say when you jump on a call with a CRO or a VP of sales if you're just starting out at Atrium? It's, hey. Thanks for joining us. Like, gonna, you know, take you through some questions associated with the problem that we think people are potentially gonna solve. And it's really important to lean into we think we have a hypothesis, etcetera. Because, like, what you want them to do is you want them to feel at home being like, nah, brah. I don't have that problem. Right? Because that's important information. And then you hear that 10 times like, oh, maybe this market doesn't exist. Like, maybe we shouldn't be going after this. But you want them to be able to be honest. Right? So, hey. Gonna ask you some questions around some hypotheses. Everyone, you'd be honest about it. And then we'll share a little bit about what we how we think we're gonna go about solving this. For the sellers and the sales managers and the sales leaders in the audience, you may hear that and be like, wait a minute. That sounds like an upfront contract from, like, a disco call. What? It's like, yeah. Same thing. You talk to a VP of sale. Imagine you were talking to Arman, one who's the VP of sales at Pave, and maybe he's got six reps or whatever, or maybe he's got two sales managers and him. And you're talking about this, and he's, yeah. Not really. We're all in the same sales bullpen, and I I'm sitting next to both the manager. Normally, it's a problem. You you just learn something. Right? Like, this size of organization that has two managers or three managers or four managers, they don't have this problem. But then you'll get above a certain size. Oh, okay. Cool. You have got 10 managers. Then all of a sudden, that problem starts going into the four and the five range. Here's the segment that I'm gonna be going after. And so that's why we wanna cast the net a little bit wider and then do these interviews to hone in on where the size of the organization or some characteristic of the organization are that where this is like a a white hot problem. The second piece is, how do you solve this problem right now? What's unsatisfactory about this? You'll start seeing patterns in there. So, like, in our case, when we were doing all of our customer interviews, the pain point would show up when organizations had substantial numbers of managers. The way that they would typically be solving the problem is with standard business intelligence like Tableau, Looker, etcetera. The problems associated with that would be that frontline managers would really struggle to be able to consume that and make sense of it because most frontline managers don't come from an analytical background. They come from a communications and empathy background. And so we're like, great. Here's how we're thinking about it. We have a dedicated performance management solution here that measures the quantity and quality of selling behavior, and then it uses large language model AI in order to turn that into words that talks not just to your managers, but also to your reps to drive accountability and automate that. How does that sound? Or you might start out. They're like, yeah. That doesn't actually sound all that terribly great. By doing these research interviews, you're eventually gonna converse on, like, the hot white hot center, which then eventually turns into your sales motion. So to recap, essentially, what you're doing is you're setting agenda, and then you're coming in with research that allows you to build a point of view on the problem that you think they have. And you're saying, like, hey. Typically, when you have this many SDRs, this many reps on your team, you probably have this type of problem. Is that true? Is it not true? I said, maybe. Do you have that problem? And one of two things will happen. They'll either say, yeah. I have that problem, or no. I won't. What do you do when you find that you meet with four or five of these CROs and all of them are like, yeah. This is a one or two for me. Do you, in those calls, keep switching to different problems? Do you have a list of, like, 20 problems that you're trying to test with them? How do you pivot in that moment, or how do you know when it's right to pivot? So in the first step, like, if if you're getting a bunch of people over, like, yeah. I don't have that problem. Well, back to the drawing board, man. And and so then that kinda comes back to where do people typically get problems that they're addressing in start ups. And, usually, it's something that it's like some sort of problem that they encountered in their prior job. Or, usually, that's a really good one. Right? Because at least then you have an indication that at least somebody has this problem. But if it turns out that was that spoke to your organization, yeah, this organization, your organization had that, but nobody else does. Well, that's actually a really important thing to figure out early versus building a bunch of software for a problem that people don't have. So I think in the first case, it's like back to the drawing board. In the second case where it's, oh, cool. I really have that problem, but, like, your solution doesn't sound super awesome, or I have this tangential problem. A really important thing as an entrepreneur is to just follow that as a sucking sound. Lenny Richitsky is a phenomenal podcaster and writer, and he actually has this big b two b series on where startup ideas came from. A lot of them are pivots. Right? A lot of them are pivots. And then the question is, do you pivot during the interview stage, or do you pivot after you've built a bunch of software you have to throw away? Ideally, you pivot earlier on where you haven't built a bunch of software that doesn't matter. But I think what we do as entrepreneurs is we're trying to find unsolved problems in the market that we can then fit technology to and then earn a margin on solving that problem. So if that problem doesn't exist, then we probably shouldn't build something associated with it. Or if that problem does exist, but it's well satisfied, then there's probably not an opportunity for us to build something that's differentiated there. In either of those scenarios, you need to find another problem, either tangential or totally different. I'm curious. So taking this back to sales a little bit is I think so many sellers come in with a bias around what do I wanna pitch rather than letting the conversation go where it needs to go. And so you have to stop, and you have to say, this is what I'm gathering so far. Do I have this right? And then that question, there's a no lose scenario. They either say yes and you look great, or they say no and they correct you and you get the truth. Like, it's a no lose scenario. And that's what I see with so many reps, so many founders that I talk to too is, like, they wanna go down a path, but they don't really want to know, does a person really believe or or agree with what they're saying, and do they have they confirmed that they're getting it right? That's where you gotta stop, slow down, and get that pause in a really meaningful way, not say, does that make sense? Does that make sense? Like, people don't wanna have their baby called ugly. And this is a big problem that this is why not only can you not get married to the problem that may not exist, you certainly don't wanna be married to a like, a particular solution. And I think founders can oftentimes because they have some sort of, like, crazy idea for what the better mousetrap ought to be shaped versus you actually want people to like, you wanna push them away, and I was just teaching my reps about strip lining the other day or reteaching folks about strip lining. Be like, yeah. You know what? This actually doesn't seem like it's a problem for you. And if someone's yeah. I agree with you. This is great. We can be friends. We're gonna part ways here versus no. I actually do think this is a problem. Okay. Great. But you have to be confident. You have to have pretty good confidence to do the takeaway. Yeah. But, yeah, I I think the thing that's interesting is it's no lose. Like, you're showing I'm trying to understand. I'm trying to put together the pieces. I might not be able to do it quite right because I don't have all the understanding and context you do, but I'm attempting to. And you can see how my brain's working, and I think people really gravitate to that type of selling, that type of communication, that type Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. From a conversation. Peter, I wanna transition to what happens toward the end of these interviews. Sometimes they're like, yes. And at that point, you're like, awesome. Here's a proposal. Maybe you'd be a pilot customer. But oftentimes, there are founders who aren't ready for that yet. Right? They're not that close. And so if they're not a paid customer, the two traditionally lower levels of investment that you can get from people, or you could ask them to be part of your customer advisory board. They're basically advisors with a small amount of equity. Or you could ask them to be a design partner and be one of your initial users. Let's talk about the customer advisory board first. What's the right way to structure that thing? How does a customer advisory board work? I'm wondering if you could just define it for the audience and explain the right way to set up a customer advisory board. So what you want is you wanna have humans, right, who have the problem, are unsatisfied with the the current solution, who can go along with you. Now it would be great if they were paying you to do that, which is why if if somebody has high magnitude of pain and high dissatisfaction with their current solution, and depending on the segment of of customer that you're going after, oftentimes, they will have budget for these sort of things, like speculative budget. If that's the case, fantastic. If that's not the case and you have to build it on spec, one way of organizations do this is they do consulting on the side, and they build a solution while they're consulting, or they build a solution that gives them leverage in their consulting kind of practice, or they have some sort of funding or what have you. In either of those situations, what you're gonna need is someone who's going to adopt your solution and validate, hey. Does this solve your problem better than that existing solution as indicated by some sort of KPI? Right? Are your managers managing performance managing more effectively, and are your reps performing in a higher performance capacity as a result of your adoption of this thing as indicated by a rise in activity levels, as indicated by a rise in entertainment, as indicated by x y z? And you can't just do that without customers. And so closing for so a customer advisory board is really fantastic for that because now you can share out with them, like, mock ups or, hey. We've got a demo. We've got a beta we got some alpha software here. Let's go ahead and set up a bunch of demos for that and get your feedback on this. Here's a video. What do you think? And, like, just having an audience who's bought in some sort of capacity that you can then do that with is very compelling. Ideally, your design partners are paying you, in which case, it's like the first bucket. But it's essentially the same sort of thing where you have someone who is committed to solving that problem that we validated that they have, that they're unsatisfied with the current solution through adopting the software in order to solve that problem. I think both of those can be very effective things to do, but one of the things you wanna do is you wanna leverage the heck out of them. So you can't just be like, you're on the board. Alright. Put it on LinkedIn. Yay. There have to be actions associated with it, like interviews and demos and feedback and usage and desk sides and so on and so forth. There have to be actions that are happening or else it it's not all that helpful. The way that oftentimes we thought about it at Pave was, number one, we didn't do design part to your point. It's no they're just going to pay to be customers or they're gonna be on our customer advisory board. And oftentimes, we would use customer advisory boards if we felt like we weren't even ready to solve the main problem yet. That means we're not even market ready. The customer advisory board is gonna get us that 50% or that 70% mark. Right? At that point, then we're ready to sign early customers as early adopters, maybe at the 50 or 70 where we at least solve the big problem for them. And that big problem is so vision aligned that they're okay with some of the smaller problems burning for now. And those customers are the ones who will pull you in the right direction so that you solve the right small problems. But I remember there was one time that PWC Middle East came inbound at Pave, and they wanted us to literally, just the craziest problems in the world. And it was so tempting to sign that customer on day one, And I've seen it so freaking often where a company signs the wrong first customer, which means you oftentimes solve the wrong big problem. And I think that's something you just have to be mindful of as it relates to design partners. You don't necessarily wanna be captured as a professional service for a large organization. The champagne problem, hard to deal with or hard to contend with, but just something to be mindful of there because you don't want your entire product road map being dictated by somebody who may have bespoke prompts. If they have the same problems as everybody else and they're paying you to solve it and, like, you then you can resell those same features to everybody else, alright. Sweet. But if they have, like, weird bespoke problems like PwC in Middle East might have, then, then, yes, that would potentially be a problem. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Well, Pete, this was an amazing show. We have to move to our final question. We talked about a lot of good habits as it pertains to founder led sales. It's time to talk about a bad one. So if there was one bad habit in the world of founder led sales that all founders should break today, what would that be? Expecting somebody else to sell your first customers for you. Doesn't work. That is about as much of a mic drop as we need. So Done. Pete, thank you for an amazing show. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Cheers. Alrighty, Mark. It is time for a two by two recap email from this episode with Pete Kazanji. Number one. I know he said it at the end. I know it was the mic drop moment, but it bears repeating. Your first customers are on the founder. If anybody else gets them, then they're not really customers, if you ask me. And you learn you lose so much of the richness of all those conversations. And number two, you better not have bias going into discovery. It's the hardest thing to stop as a rep. You want the conversation to go a certain way. You're scared that it might not go in a direction that you understand or it might go in a direction you don't understand. Pause, take a breath, let it go where it needs to go, and meet the customer there. If it is going well, you have a read option to go in for the kill. If they're saying, yeah. This is a problem. Yeah. I believe in your solution. Bring them on as one of your pilot customers. But number four, that might not always be the case. So if that's not the case, if you aren't ready to solve the big problem yet, you may consider launching a customer advisory board where you give a small amount of equity for people who are invested to be early advisers on your product and get your product to the point where you can solve one big problem. Folks, if you like this one, we did a whole webinar on founder led sales. It was how Pave got their first customers, and it was featuring the CEO of Pave, Matt, my previous boss, myself, and the early stage Pave sales team. So link to that is in the show notes. I would definitely recommend watching that if you like this one. Stay tuned for the next one. Peace. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's.
