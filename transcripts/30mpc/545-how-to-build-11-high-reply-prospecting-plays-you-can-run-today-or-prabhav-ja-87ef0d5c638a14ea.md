## Transcript

Biggest limiting belief is that this will kind of replace our jobs and take, you know, value out of our heads. I think it's a complete opposite. I think it will give you so much leverage and so much value that you will be able to generate revenue and demands for the business at such a large scale. You just couldn't even think was possible. Right? So instead of SDRs being this job that like no one really wants to do, but views as a stepping stone to getting to next step in their career, will actually become something where the most creative people will thrive. They'll be able to come in and basically be like, hey, I have ideas and now I can execute at the speed of my thought, which is something that was just wasn't possible before. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of 30 to president's club. My name is Arman Farog, and I'm here with my coach, Nick Skalski. And, folks, today, we have a special episode that was honestly one of the most fun recordings we've had in a minute. So what we did is we interviewed the CEO of eleven x, Prabhof. And if you're not familiar with eleven x, what they do is they basically have an AISDR that can send, like, thousands and thousands of, like, frankly, pretty damn good personalized cold emails. And so we are literally going to go through three real cold email examples and teach you whether or not you're using a tool like this, how you could go and build these emails yourself. Then we'll go through eight more triggers you can use to book meetings today. So, basically, 11 email examples with triggers for each. And then we'll talk about if you're using any of these tools that help you send mass scale personalized emails, how your day can change as an SDR or as an AE, and what you need to be focusing on to make sure that as many of your activities as a seller are focused on revenue generating activities, not lead scraping activities. So, Nick, what did I miss? We got into a lot of, like, cutting edge forward thinking things, but we also talked a decent amount in this episode. If you're not working at one of these companies that is, like, cutting edge, has all the newest tech out there. Like, we still talked about a lot of very practical things that regardless of your tech stack, you can do today to build more pipeline more easily. Alrighty, folks. Let's roll. In a three, two, one. Let's do it. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Adi Prabhav, welcome to the show. We are going to go through 11 email prospecting plays that you can run to book more meetings. We're gonna go through three in deep detail, like, all like, going through the exact emails and then eight rapid fire. Let's start with number one, themed outreach based on identity. And in this case, we're gonna use someone's alma mater or a sports analogy from an email that you actually sent me to get my attention before you were even working with us. Awesome. So first one we think about a lot is basically theme based outreach based on some unique portion of your identity. So think alma mater, think sports team. And so we actually tell our agent, hey. Go find me alumni, for the following, you know, NCAA division teams or FSP schools. Schools. And then we'll say, hey. For the signals we're looking for, make sure that the company this prospect works at, is hiring for outbound roles or has talked about some, you know, unique public facing sales team initiatives. And then we can't tell our researcher, confirm the prospect's alma mater, pull in 2025 or 2026 season projections, find relevant business context, and identify kind of business rivals. This is what we're telling our researcher. Right? And then we tell kind of our our message writer, right, the person the the agent that's actually writing this this kind of cold outbound emails to use metaphors for schools or sports references and incorporate different themes in a multi step sequence. And so the reason this, this play is really interesting is I think we actually use this on you, Arman. I think we sent you an email using this exact play. And so I thought it'd be kinda cool to just, read out what that email actually looked like. So it basically went something like, hey, Arman. Picture this. November 29, USC versus UCLA. Stadium lights cutting through the LA night. 90,000 people on their feet. But the best part isn't the noise. It's watching a team that's locked in. No hesitation. No second guessing. Just clean execution from the first snap. That's the feeling when your outbound runs like Alice or neutral SDR. She shows up every day, the same rhythm your top performers bring. Consistent, reliable, never drifts from the play. They've seen teams cut a bunch of costs while hitting 80% better meeting conversion rates. Curious how that execution translates to your outbound game. So, Arman, what stood out in that email? Because I remember you forwarded it to me being like, this is badass. Thank you so like, you were really excited about it. What were the things that caught your eye in in receiving it? So the first thing that caught my eye is when I received this email, the subject line was November 29, USC versus UCLA Energy. And I was like, okay. Like, whoever whoever I have no idea what this is about, but whoever wrote this email clearly did some research on me. So I was like, I'll open it. And then there was a very clean transition to a story that felt very human. It was like, picture this, November 29, USC versus UCLA, stadium lights cutting through the LA light. And I was like, I think I was actually at a game that kind of felt like this. I was like, okay. I still have no idea what this is about, but, like, you have my attention. And then the second thing that got my attention was the clear transition from USC UCLA football to the problem or the product that was in play, and it didn't feel too much like an overreach. So that that I found was quite interesting. The really important thing there is what Kyle Coleman on episode four, I think, taught us, which is the art of the segue, which is the ability to transition from nonbusiness personalization to a business message in a way that actually feels fluid. I go on LinkedIn, and I see all this debate about, like, oh, you should never personalize on something that's, like, just, like, about them. It has to be, like, business related. You have to say, oh, I see you're hiring, or I see that you're launching a new product because, like, no one cares where your alma mater was. That's true if you're not able to segue and connect the two. And so I actually think when folks grasp the fact that they can use both business and personal personalization, as long as they segue appropriately, it actually opens up a massive, massive pool for your prospecting personalization that you might not otherwise be able to access if you only focused on business things. So, Pravad, I'm curious when you had 11 x, in this case, Alice, your SDR agent, building these emails. Is this how all of your prospecting emails are typically structured? Is it typically focused with personalization first, a new problem, a new solution, or are there other common, like, email structures that you see that get particularly high replies? We had a ton of different email structures. I think I think as you all will know when it comes to cold outbound, you can't use the same structure for every use case. Right? So if I'm trying to get you to sign up for an event, right, if I'm trying to take a meeting with me, those are two very kind of different things that we're trying to do. And so we actually have our agent pick between a bunch of different structures based on the actual prospect we're reaching out to, where they work at, the size of that company, the industry. And so we give more agency to our agents, and then we it kind of learns very quickly what's working and what's not. And so even in this example, it was completely written by our agent. There's only a few men who actually went wrote any of these emails. So this one flowed personalization into solution, like a store like, almost an analogy into social proof, which is this is how we help other teams, into an open ended question, which is curious how that execution translates to your outbound game. Right? What is an example of a different structure that might flow differently? Yeah. I mean, it could be a compelling news event that just happened recently. Hey. Did you hear about x y z that just happened? I'm sure this is top of mind for you as you think about whatever the kind of problem statement is. Right? And then based on that problem statement, we go into, like, hey. Imagine if you could increase x by y percent similar to what your x y you know, closest business rival, whatever, did. And so it is taking something that compelling that happened, talking about that, using that as a call to action for why they must talk to us. Alright. Let's move us now to number two, which I I think this one is very interesting. It is outreach based upon reviews of the company that you're reaching out to and what you see on, like, their Google or Yelp review page. So second one is actually really interesting because it it kinda points at custom signals that make sense for your business. You know, we're too used to kind of these signals that kind of everyone has access to, like, someone change jobs or you raise funding. You know, when I when when, when we raised funding, I had a million emails in my mailbox. I didn't read a single one of them. Right? So so we want to do is create a way for you to be creative and figure out what signals make sense for your business. So, you know, we have an inbound product. So one of the signals that we had was kind of review led outreach, which is trying to find some evidence of public friction and use that as kind of a pain point when we reach out to a person. So in our case, we said, hey. Find me services businesses with multiple branches that have Yelp or Google reviews that mentioned that it's difficult to get someone on the phone, whether they're still gonna get on the phone, whether they're probably calling and no one picked up. Right? So that's a real compelling problem. Right? And so in this case, you're referencing the exact pinpoints. We frame, you know, 11 x as a way to eliminate that response kind of flag. And it worked well because the prospect knows they have that problem. I'm sure they've looked at the, you know, googling your pages. The great thing here is that our agent is actually will go in and actually find that evidence because it's available on the public web. And so as an example of what, what an email would look like here is something like, hey. I was checking out of your reviews and saw that it's been challenging to handle all the inbound demand you're getting. Like, that's a great problem to have. We've helped similar businesses automate their inbound flow so your reps can focus on the highest quality qualified leads. We're at the chat to see how we can boost inbound conversions by more than 40%. Right? And so it's a short email. It gets at the pinpoint. It tells them how they can increase, increase their conversions, and it gives them kind of a proof point in a three sentence email. Do you have a sense of what the subject line for that might be? I don't know if you can come up on the spot, but I'm curious. Yeah. I actually I actually remember. I was like, hey. I tried calling the actual phone number. Nobody picked up. Oh, that's good. Moving forward, it would be equivalent if I was looking at my email and I saw someone say, Arman, I tried to call your phone number and no one answered. I'm probably gonna open it if I'm running a restaurant or a bar or some services business. Probably not for thirty minutes to President's Club because people are trying to sell me software, but I digress. What is the art in tonality when it comes to calling out someone's bad reviews on Google or Yelp because you're very intentional in not ripping on them for having a bad Yelp review. Every challenge and every problem you have is really just an opportunity in hiding. Right? So if someone is not able to pick up the phone, that means they probably the business is probably going well. They'd be they have too few workers for everything they need to do. So we turn that into an opportunity. So instead of being like, hey. You know, shame on you for not being able to do this. It's like, hey. You have to increase your revenue just by solving the small pinpoint that you have. You're clearly offering the service people like, which is why they're calling in. Right? So so I think the the the the thing we always try to strike is, like, hey. How much more could you gain if you would have fixed this problem as opposed to, like, you know, bad on you for having this problem? I remember one of the things that our rev ops we were hiring someone as a head of rev ops at Carta, and that head of rev ops did secret shopping with us. And our VP of sales was so pissed at the time. He requested a demo, and he looked at the user flow, and then he counted how many seconds, minutes, hours, days it took for the average SDR on each team to reply. And, obviously, it kinda freaked out our VP of sales initially. And what he was able to say is, like, look. These are the three that are actually in line with industry standard. You're doing great. If you improve these other three to this benchmark, here's how much more money you could make just by getting better at speed to lead. And so he framed it as an opportunity even though, initially, as VP of sales, like, you don't want people, like, monkeying around with your speed to lead and, like, poking into your business. Let's move to number three, which was career progression recognition. Yeah. Yeah. This one's this one's a really interesting one. And, you know, the great thing that I was left to do is come up with, like, really creative ideas that people haven't thought of before and then test it out. Mhmm. And so in this case, it's like, you know, we we asked our agent to kind of go and find sales leaders who started at their current company as an IC and are now in, like, management or a leadership position. So we we, you know, we we also gave our agents some more criteria around, like, a certain geography or certain revenue target. Yeah. But the real great thing is that, you know, folks would open their emails because they know that someone was actually acknowledging their career milestones. And then we would draw parallels. It's the same metaphor thing that you were talking about earlier, Nick. We drew parallels between the career consistency and the consistent outline execution that our agents do. Right? So, again, the kind of smooth metaphor. And then they positioned Alice as handling kind of the prospecting fundamentals so that their teams could focus on closing and move them even further up kind of sales leadership track. And then we included, you know, customer proof points where where relevant. And so example of what this email could look like is, like, you know, hey. Hey, Nick. You know, going from SDR to a sales manager, while actively, you know, kind of helping your network and land roles, that's that's not luck. That's someone who's earned their seat through results. You know, your approach to building teams mirrors what actually works in outbound. Consistency over shortcuts. Value before the ask. Alice, our AISDR handles a prospecting grind, so your reps focus on what you probably did best, which is closing. And then we say, hey. You know, GuapShops saw 1.5 x more SQLs per rep after implementing Alex. Worth a quick look. That's awesome. I remember one of the biggest deals that I closed at Pave in my first year came from an email that said from PayPal to Facebook, and it described this person's trajectory. And he was like, the moment I saw that in the subject line, I was like, you I know you know something about me. And whether it's someone getting promoted multiple times at one company or someone going from one great company to another company, some of this is just the art of showing someone that you are not a robot and that you actually took the time to look at them and then having fun in the transition to whatever problem or product you solve. Before we jump into the remaining eight emails, in your first prompt, it said use metaphors for school, yada yada yada. Incorporate different themes for each email in a five step sequence. These were all talking about the first emails you would send in a sequence. Could you talk about the strategy for the next four? Both, is there a story you're trying to tell? But then, also, you mentioned you don't wanna fatigue them by using the same email structure over and over again. What's the right way to, like, vary up the sequence over emails two through five? Yeah. It's actually really interesting. We use a lot of different variations of this because as you can imagine, different things work for different use cases. So, you know, we'll we'll probably have one of the emails in a sequence just, like, offer some value. Like, hey. This is the exact strategies x company used to scale, you know, their their outbound. Right? And we'll offer a few strategy and just say, hey. Do you wanna chat about other ways that we could help? Right? And so and this will all be after some other analogy about the sports team. But we could also say, hey. Of the five step email, only use, you know, sports analogies in three of them. Right? So it's not like Tyrone and the person I would like, trying to come up with some some other metaphor for the exact same game. So so, you know, we we we, again, give our agents some creativity, but, basically, give it parameters. We tell it, hey. Five step sequence. In three of them, use these things. In one, just kinda give value about what's worked for someone else. In another one, kind of point them to this, like, newest thing that we've done recently. And so everyone is has different structure as well. So it could be something like, a two sentence email. Very brief, straight to the point. And then maybe, you know, the last step in the sequence could be, like, a breakup email. And so we kind of experiment with sort of various versions of this. And what we also tell our agent is, like, here's eight and fifteen different structures you can pick from. Choose and see what happens. To what extent are you using the thoughts or any thoughts bump email? Because I remember back in, like, 2020, step two and, like, step six in my sequence, we would use that because, like, the effort I would have to put into finding another piece of personalization or writing another custom email was too much, and you were better off just, like, resurfacing that original personalized email. I'm curious if you've run any experiments or looked at any data across your customer base about what's working versus not with that. You know, it's interesting. We've kind of had a lot of, like, internal debates about this, like, what the best practices used to be versus what they should be today. And it's really hard to exactly what you mentioned, Nick. It's really hard to, like, untangle which of those best practices were just a way to, like, save time because you had to prospect a lot of accounts versus actually best practices in terms of conversions. Right? I think if you sent, like, essays for every single step of the sequence, the movie will be like, okay. This is, like, this is too much. Right? But, like, sending an email saying, like, thoughts question mark just feels, like, very lazy. It feels like, like, you you could use that as a way to just offer some value. It could be small. It could be like, hey. Check out this case study that we saw of, you know, x y z person scaling. And so even if it's like a one sentence email, we try to offer at least some value because this is another opportunity for you to kick some other interest that prospect may have. So let's go through the other eight plays rapid fire. So we went through three deep dive. Let's go all the way up to 11. So what are the other eight? Alright. So eight quick rapid fire examples of plays you could be running today. One, public filings, especially if you're going after enterprise accounts and asking for something specific in their earning reports or public filings that hit kind of a compelling need. Podcast and content signals, mining. Find specific nugget from a podcast I've done or or a blog post they've written and use that as your hook to kinda get, interest from that prospect. Custom kind of hobbies. So imagine a running metaphor. So find leaders who posted about running, use running metaphors to kind of as your hook and use that as a segue to get interest about the product or service that you're doing. Website visitor retargeting place. There is so much data in people visiting your website. Pages they're visiting, the amount of time they're spending on each page, where they're coming from, how many times they come back. That's really valuable data you can use to really target them in hyper specific ways because they have some intent. They're already on your website. Revisiting closed loss opportunities. If you look at our book of business for a sales rep, all of these closed off opportunities that have in the past is just opportunities waiting to happen, but they haven't actually reengaged them. He's always on campaigns looking at why you lost that deal, using that as a hook to be like, hey. Here's how everything that's changed. We want to chat. Wake to dead. All these inactive leads that are just sitting there dormant, there's no reason you can't be nurturing them constantly with new information about your products or services or success you have gotten for other customers. Competitive takeouts. Right? So targeting leads who have used or using and considering a specific competitor, great way to show them more content about other folks who switch from that competitor to your product and the kind of benefits that you offer. And finally, this is for all the marketing leaders out there who manage SDR and BDR teams, event registrations, follow ups, no shows, automating all those pieces to make sure that you get more people top funnel. So, Prabhav, we've talked about 11 different plays that you can use as an SDR, as an AE to book more meetings. And in the prep, you were talking a lot about how the day of a salesperson, how the day of an SDR and AE looks completely different today and will look completely different in a year than it did in 2015 when people were sending emails one by one or, like, sending mass automated unpersonalized emails in 2015, for example. So could you give an example of, like, what does an SDR's day look like? Are they approving these emails? Are they just editing the emails that Eleven x is drafting for them? Like, how do I what does the job even look like now? Yeah. You know, it's it's it's something we spend a lot of time. I love what I was thinking about. And you I don't I don't know if you're all familiar with this stat, but, typically, 40% of a company spend in sales and marketing. So we try to think think about it. If you take all that spend and made all these SDRs, AEs, you know, super AEs and SDRs, what would that actually look like? And so, you know, we don't have any, SDRs at eleven x. Right? All this kind of work is done by either our growth teams or CSMs or AEs. And I think in the future, like, a true SDR will probably just be managing a team of agents where each agent has a very specific job. So one agent will be just prospecting. They define the ICP. This agent is always looking and trying to find the best leads for them. Another agent is saying, alright. You found this audience for me. How am I gonna be able to actually get the right nuggets of information in a specific campaign? Right? And then what channel should I use to reach out to them? And so instead of, like, reactively going after and trying to find these leads, you just define what you care about and have your agents bring the leads to you. So it becomes much more proactive. Right? So you're, like, managing like, every SDR will become an SDR manager. Right? And I think, in terms of that to workflows, once you have a creative idea in your head, from there, the ability to actually go from that idea to execution should be a matter of hours at max or minutes. It shouldn't be days or weeks or months. Right? And so I'd imagine that this AI agent would already be trained in the company's brand voice and the tone and kind of messaging they like to use. So there's no reason for them to even be editing what they're sending out. That would be, in my opinion, a failure of AI. Instead, this is the context of the ages for what they're trying to do, see a few sample outputs, looks good, and that campaign is kind of authorizes. Right? So the kind of clock speed that you'll get and number of iterations you'll be able to do as an SDR to test out messaging, test out new product launches, build pipeline is gonna be 11 x, you know, what they can do today. So let's break this down piece by piece because you probably get to see teams that are doing, like, brick and mortar style prospecting. And then you see teams where it's like one rep is doing all of the prospecting that an entire sales team would do. So the first step in prospecting is oftentimes prioritizing the right accounts and leads that you want to work in the first place. So before, what you would do is you would look at your book of a 100 accounts. You would say these are my top five. These are the ideal prospects, champions, what have you. And they'd be like, alright. Here's, like, my target of, like, top five to 10 accounts, top five to 10 prospects on each of them. Right? What does that look like in a less manual world for teams that are literally doing today that wanna do it more efficiently? You know, the the the kind of analogy I always use for this is imagine that you're the SDR manager onboarding a new SDR onto your team today. You probably give them some instruction, and you give them some enablement. Hey. This is our ICP. This is the type of people you should be looking for. These are types of deals that convert a lot, better than our other kind of deals. That is the instruction that you should be giving to your team of AI agents. Right? And these agents will take that kind of language, that instructions that you gave it, and bring you those leads and bring you those accounts and help you prioritize. And there's no reason why now you as a human have to go and do that manual work, do the triage, do the ranking. Instead, you're like, hey. These are accounts I should be going after. Great. Let me figure out how to break into those accounts. I remember we would, Nick, we always talk about shuttle running when we're training reps, which is if you've ever done shuttle runs in some sort of sport, you run to the five yard line back, 10 yard line back, 15 yard line back, 20 yard line back. And when you're training SDR, oftentimes, you should be doing the same thing, which is you make them go find five accounts, they bring them back. You're like, okay. Those are good. These ones are bad. Okay. Now go find the five contacts on each. Come back. Alright. Great. Now go write the first five emails to those. Come back. Approve it. Right? And that's how you make sure that an SDR, three months later hasn't sent 10,000 bad emails is you put in all training work upfront on your SDR. You calibrate a lot upfront, and then they can sprint for the next three months once you've done all that upfront calibration work. And so a lot of the times when people are using AI anything tools, I see them, like, plug in their first inputs, get a response that they don't like, and they say, AI doesn't work for me. I'm just gonna go manual. Are there other common mistakes that people make when they're training AI to write in their voice, target prospects, etcetera, that that people can avoid? You know, I think, I think about this is this. There's, like, two insights we've had from our conversations with leaders when it comes to these pieces. One, sales teams are gonna win in the future are the ones that have the ability to experiment and learn from their mistakes. Right? The world of AI is a very new thing. It's not gonna work out of the box as you mentioned, Armand. So you have to put in those reps and figure out what works. Because once you figure out what works, it's gonna scale better than anything else that you have. The second thing is, let's say you were opening a new office in another country. You were hiring your first SDR. Right? You probably can't use the exact same strategy you'd be using in another country at this place. You gotta put you gotta put in the reps. You gotta learn what works for that specific geography, how the buyers operate, how you should prospect to those buyers. The same thing with AI. Right? But you kind of onboard your first AI. You gotta you gotta teach it. You gotta you gotta understand and learn its nuances. Right? And go to those reps. The great thing is that doesn't take months. It's takes a few short weeks. At the same time, it takes more than, you know, one message or one prompt. Right? It takes more than an hour. And so we always tell our customers who truly see the value of this, probably need one to three months. Right? But you have to print those reps. You have to assume it's going to work because it is at some point, but you have to just print the reps upfront. I'm curious about I'm sure we have folks listening to this who Armand, you were talking about the the spectrum. I'm sure we have some folks here who, like they're listening to this episode, and they go on LinkedIn, and they see all of this noise and energy around how AI is changing sales, specifically around building pipeline. And I've worked at some companies where I would describe, like, the tech sack they have and the way they think about technology is, like, being fairly dated. And I would imagine some of the folks who work at companies like those hearing or talking about today and being, like, kind of freaking scared. And so I guess other than being like, I'm quitting the company I've worked at for the last twelve years to go work at, like, a seed stage startup where I know they're gonna be building this from stuff from scratch. What are some things that salespeople or sales leaders listening to this episode can do today irrespective of their tech stack that will help them move in a direction to be able to succeed in, like, the way that sales is changing? Yeah. That's a that's a great question. And I think the best advice I've gotten, the best way I've seen this transformation happen is picking one person. Right? Maybe maybe that SDR manager picks, like, one SDR. Right? Or one owner inside a company that says, hey. Your job for next two months is to experiment with these various pieces. And I think it has to be done a way where it's not like, hey. AI is gonna replace all our jobs. AI is gonna make us way more efficient and let us do our jobs way, way, way better. Right? And when I talk to SDRs, it's not they wanna spend all their time, like, researching leads. Right? That's something they have to do for their job, but the the reason I can't do that for them. So I was is getting to be creative and thinking about the creative ways to do accounts. And, like, the old way is 94 of your time is just, like, the grind Lead scrubbing. Correct. Data sources. Yeah. Leads scrubbing. And 4%, like, thinking creatively. So you're right. Like, I actually think this this allows you to lean more to the art of selling than the mind of it. But I interrupted you. I apologize. No. No. I think so so I always tell sales leader, like, hey. Appoint someone and give them ownership and the ability to actually experiment with these things. Right? Because at the very least, they'll come back having learnt a lot, right, which will make your overall sales organization more efficient and better. And so I think, you know, sometimes it can feel daunting, especially if you have a large sales organization to be like, hey. How am I gonna actually, like, call all this change to happen? You don't have to change everything at once. Right? Like, one small part of your team, take one person, have them go and experiment, give them a very specific goal. Hey. Drive me, you know, five meetings this month from an AI generated solution. Right? Start small. Give give one person the agency and ownership and the ability to experiment and see what they come back with. Amazing. This has been a great episode. We've got time for one more question. So the final question that I have for you, I'm curious your most contrarian take on AI in sales where you think the common perspective that most folks hold is holding them back. I think that the I mean, I don't I don't actually know this is contrarian, but the biggest trope I hear is that AI will kind of replace our jobs. You know, we actually had this use case once where, we sold this large company, and the CEO kind of went on a podcast and said, yeah. We're gonna replace our SDRs. And the folks that were using our product at the company were SDRs. So that evaluation did not go very well as you can imagine. Right? We obviously did not tell the CEO to say this, but he kinda just said And so I think, the way the way I think about that, the biggest limiting belief is that this will kind of replace our jobs and take, you know, value out of our hands. I think it's a complete opposite. I think it will give you so much leverage and so much value that you will be able to generate revenue and demands for the business at such a large scale. I just couldn't even think was possible. Right? So instead of SDRs being this job that, like, no one really wants to do but views as a stepping stone to getting to next step in their career, It'll actually become something where the most creative people will thrive. Right? They'll be able to come in and basically be like, hey. I have ideas, and now I can execute at the speed of my thought, which is something that was just wasn't possible before. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Pravav, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It's time for a three step recap and one thing you can do. Alright. Three step recap. I'm actually gonna give one signal, which is I loved this themed outreach based on my alma mater. Specifically, the subject line was November 29, USC versus UCLA. And then the first paragraph of the email started with picture this, November 29, USC versus UCLA, and dropped into a story. It felt human. You can do that regardless of what tools you're using. That's number one. Number two is throughout the sequence, try not to use the exact same email structure. So instead of personalization, problem, solution, CTA, you might do the second one as a two sentence email. The third one might be a breakup email. You might have an email that is problem, social proof, outcome. Vary up the structure. Otherwise, it will feel repetitive and fatigue your prospect. And then lastly, number three is if you are a rep or an SDR or what have you, instead of looking at AI as this tool that's just going to, like, deliver everything for you perfectly on the first go, think of it as if you are the SDR manager and you're training your SDR. You're gonna have to spend time calibrating the right leads to pull, the right email tone, all that stuff. But spend the time upfront to do that knowing that it's not gonna be perfect on day one. And that is the thing that you are going to use for the next two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ten months to book way more meetings than you could do on your own. Alrighty, Nick. What's one thing people can do? Actually, I have three things depending upon sort of what type of org you're working at. So if you're a rep at an org that doesn't really have any of this fancy AI stuff, I recommend that you go run the metaphor play that we talked about in this episode where you can find a piece of personal personalization and then go to any LLM and get it to create a metaphor that segues from the personal personalization to the business problem that you solve. However, if you're a rep that is empowered with some of the AI and tech that we've been talking about on this episode, my assumption is at least one of the plays we talked about is new for you or new for your org. So go back and pick one play and go execute on that. And if you're a sales leader listening with this episode, one of the best pieces of advice that I I think Prabhav shared with me was if you're feeling like you might be behind or your org might be behind from an AI for sales adoption, experimenting because that is how you're going to start to get some of this best practice stuff into your org. You don't need to do a massive $500,000 tech rollout in order at least take your first baby step in moving towards this stuff. And what's one thing people can steal? We talked a lot about, like, email best practices, and it reminded me a lot of what we talked about when we did our cold email course with Jason Bey, where Jason Bey breaks down, like, step by step everything from subject lines to personalization to deliverability to your CTAs. And he talks about how you can use AI to make all of those things faster, better, easier. We've got a link to that course we did with Jason Bay in today's show notes and maybe even a coupon code if you wanna check it out. Thanks for listening, folks. We'll see you next week on the show. So if you liked what we were talking about on this episode, we partnered with the team over at eleven x to put together a three part outbound system that includes the signals, the email messages, and the sequence that you can use. There is a link to go get it for free in today's show notes. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week on the show.
