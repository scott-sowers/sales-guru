## Transcript

If you're in sales and you're not booking one in four cold calls, that's good news because you could literally be making the same number of cold calls and get two, three, or four meetings every single hour you dial just by tweaking your opener, throwing the marketing pitch away, or maybe agreeing with the first objection before you try to handle it. We've broken down every single step of the cold call with talk tracks and voiceovers inside of our cold calls to presidents club course, where every single week inside of the community, we will literally critique and coach you on your cold calls to make sure that you are doing it right and then hold you accountable to picking up the phone every single week inside of the community. It is the ultimate way to cold call your way to Presidents Club in 2025. Check it out in the show notes and enjoy this clip from the course. Alrighty, folks. You know the words for your opener. You know how those words should sound. And now you know the words for your problem prop. And now you need to know how your problem prop should sound. And so we're covering that in three steps. Number one, we're gonna cover tone tips for what you should be thinking when you're delivering your problem proposition. And then from there, we're going to attach those tone tips to different parts of the problem prop talk track. And then from there, we will go through some real call reviews so you can hear what that sounds like in practice. The biggest mistake that people make when they're delivering their problem proposition is they sound like they don't really care about the problem at all, which is natural because you're not actually experiencing your prospect's pain day to day, but you've gotta be able to join them. And one of the best ways to do that is think, isn't it ridiculous when you are vocalizing that problem? You need to feel like you are joining them in the pain, like it's something that you felt before. Emote here and get big with the energy of the craziness, of the frustration, of the anxiety related to the problem, and that will get your prospect's attention. And so you'll notice most of that big emotion comes at the front end of the problem proposition Yep. When you're describing the triggering problem. When you're describing the triggering problem, oftentimes, that's when you wanna think. Isn't it ridiculous? Or isn't it ridiculous that you literally have to sit through 2,000 inbound applications Right. And that's the type of tone you use when you're describing the annoyances or the emotion inside of the triggering problem. Yep. From there, the solution is really an afterthought. Similar to what we discussed with the opener is you don't want them focused on a hard pitch. Yep. You want it to be like, look. So so we do this thing, so you don't have to do that shitty thing over there. Mhmm. That's how the tone should sound when you're going through your solution. And so the last step with the low friction call to action is you're asking them for a meeting, which is honestly applying some pressure to them. And so you wanna release that pressure with your tone. And the best way to do that is to shrug while you ask for the interest. You might say, I know this was totally out of the blue, but are you open to learning more when I'm not cold calling you out of the blue? It's sort of like a laissez faire take it or leave it kind of thing. So let's actually drop into some more call reviews, and let's hear what this sounds like in practice. Alright. So this first call is, again, from McKenna at practice. We're gonna play all the way through the opener and the prop props so you can hear them both together. Hello? Hey, Nick. We work with a couple other career coaching companies in the area. It's McKenna with practice. Have you heard that name, Pastor? No. I haven't. No worries. It sounds like this is a good old fashioned cold call, which means it's probably gonna be a little awkward for both of us. Do you mind if I take thirty seconds to explain why I'm calling and you can hang up on me at any point? Well, sure. So, again, she did a great job with that familiar tone and that laugh in the transition from the heard the name tossed around opener to the permission based opener. And now she's gonna drop into the prop and prop. Thanks. I appreciate it. Well, I noticed that your team offers my plan to post it, and then they book directly through your guys' homepage, their sessions. And oftentimes, we hear when coaching orgs offer this level of prioritization, it's great for their clients, but it adds some overhead to your guys' plate. So managing, scheduling, invoicing, the coach payout, like, the resource, tracking, and sharing as well. We ended up calling platform specifically for coaching organizations to house and then streamline a lot of that. I'm sure you guys have a great system in place, but I am curious if anything I mentioned just resonated with you at all or not. Cool. Alright. So here's what I liked about McKenna's problem prop. Yeah. So her triggering problem included some really, really good context. It was, I noticed that you offer customized coaching solutions Mhmm. And that immediately gets the person to sit up and think about the setting or the things that they're offering that are related to the problem they solve. And then from there, she got into the specific annoyances of why that context leads to problems with invoicing complexity, scheduling complexity, and all these other things. If I were to give McKenna any sort of feedback, it would actually be on her one sentence solution Mhmm. Where her one sentence solution is a little bit vague where she's saying we streamline all of those things Yep. Because we're a purpose built platform for coaching organizations. Yep. But I do like the fact that she said that we are a purpose built platform for coaching organizations, which allows us to solve those problems. Yeah. I think, generally, her tone throughout this thing is, like, she clearly cares about what she's talking about. Even if you think about, like, she's like, I noticed this on the site. The way that she's calling out, like, she's making it very clear. I did some prep for this thing. And then along the way, she's sort of rattling off, here's the problems. Yeah. I feel like she she actually gives a damn about what she's talking about, which matters more than you realize. Let's hear another one. I think the next one's Dylan over at Covey. And as a reminder, Covey has the AI sourcing robot Yeah. That allows you to screen thousands and thousands of inbound resumes so you don't have to do that yourself. Alright? Let's dive in. Hello? Hey, Noel. This is Dylan. I know you're not expecting this call, so feel free to hang up. If you need to do, it was just hoping you had thirty seconds for me to explain how I was calling. Alright. So he's starting with a standard untailored permission based opener. Yep. Solid opener overall. But I would have loved to hear a little bit of context on the front end. Yep. I'm I'm sorry. Dylan from where? It's a company called Covey. Have you heard that name tossed around before? No. So you'll notice he actually does it the other way around Yeah. Where he rolls into the herd the name tossed around opener. We've actually worked on this a little bit together. Yeah. And it's sort of awkward, and it creates the stop start in the call where it's almost going back to an introduction Yeah. Instead of going right into a permission based ask and going right back in your problem. I've heard a lot of people do this. You can't start with, hey. This is a cold call, and then try to try to make it seem like this is familiar. This is a peer. This isn't a cold call. You can't go in that order. You can go heard the name first and then fall back on permission based, but it doesn't work when you go backwards. So now at this point, let's see what happens when Dylan does deliver his problem prop. Okay. Well, if you have thirty seconds, you know, you can decide if you wanna keep on talking after, if that makes sense for you. Sure. Cool. Appreciate that. Yeah. So the main reason I'm I'm reaching out is just that most talent teams just kinda hate sifting through 2,000, 3,000, or so inbound applications to figure out which of the five candidates they should actually talk to. So, essentially, what Covey does is it takes your ideal candidate criteria and uses AI to surface the top applicant So you're not necessarily spending all day screening resumes. I know you're probably all set in this department, but was just wondering if you may be open to taking a look. Maybe not for now, but just so you kinda know what's out there. So you'll notice the words for the talk track Mhmm. Are on point. Perfect. The biggest thing that I would critique is it's a little bit of the going through the motions tone. Yes. It doesn't feel like Dylan is joining the pain of look. Literally imagine you post a job Sure. And you see 1,000 applicants. Where would you even start? You would have to scroll through them one by one, and I wish he would join that ridiculousness of the problem. It's flat the whole way through. You've gotta vary your tone. There's gotta be some big energy, and then you've gotta have the almost afterthought of the solution, and that didn't come across there. It felt like he was reading a script. Exactly. The other place where I noticed it being a little bit flat was when he had the low friction call to action. He said, I know you may be set in this department. Mhmm. And just some of that is very corporate language versus saying something like, look. I know you probably totally got this stuff taken care of, but are you open to taking a look and using that shrug tone at the end? Let's go through a third one with Sean from Vitabul. Great. So this is Vitabul, which reminder is a benefits platform to help home care agencies. Human resources, Mary Colter. Hi, Mary. This is Sean with Vitabul. We we spoke with you guys back in April 2022, at the time you guys were, interested in hearing about what home cares are doing for ACA compliance and benefits. Just hoping you had half a minute to tell you why I'm reaching back out, and you can let me know if it makes sense to help. So we covered this before. Really good context upfront. Mhmm. Tone and delivery, a little bit flat. Yep. So let's see how he drops into the problem problem. So we just got permission to proceed. Okay. Awesome. Usually, when I'm speaking to HR managers and PA, you guys have that wonderful problem of staying ACA compliance with limited options to do so. I'm guessing that you guys probably already have this taken care of, or is this something that you might be exploring right now? So, yeah, I I work with Sean, and he's an awesome rep. You can hear he does deliver a problem. He starts with a problem. You he goes, you have the wonderful problem of try to stay ACA compliant. But there's definitely more he can layer in to make that more specific. He could talk about the time of year. You know, typically around q one, folks are thinking about their benefits. Or he could layer in the trigger, which is often when they hit a certain employee threshold. You know, usually, when I talk to a home care that's growing That's good. This is something that comes up. And so what I would encourage Sean to do here is think about what are some of the things that surround that problem that I can include to show that I know it even more deeply than your run of the mill cold caller. Tone wise, there was a good laugh on the front end as he dropped into the problem proposition. Yep. But then from there, he was just sort of flat monotone the entire time. And I wish he would join the ridiculousness of the problem of staying ACA compliant. The problem is there wasn't a lot of ridiculousness to join Yep. Because it wasn't a very triggering problem. So I think sometimes the word is actually preventing the tone Mhmm. From coming through. Alright. One last one. We are going to listen to Marissa Yep. From Biteable as well. Dean Mark Garrett. This and you have not done with Biteable. I know you didn't expect me to call you. It's asked a Nancy. We have time to take a minute to explain what I'm going to do. Your cat. Awesome. So I work with, like, a lot of home care able to pay that have more of our forty four pound employee. And majority of the time, they are telling me how difficult it is to find health benefit plans that are ACA compliant and affordable. I'm just curious to know if this is something you're cutting across as well. So she did a really good job explaining the problem here. You can actually see if you compare her problem proposition to Sean's, she layered in a bit more. She talked about the more than, I think, 40 employees. She mentioned the ACA compliance and affordability piece because that's a two part issue with benefits. And so there was a bit more detail that clearly got the guy's attention. What was missing was she didn't really give him any insight into what Vitable does. She didn't give him any insight into that one sentence solution. And I know if we continue here, the guy's like, yeah, but, like, what is this about? Part of the reason for the one sentence solution is if you're only talking about problems or, like, what's your intent here? What are you looking for from me? So let's listen to the reaction. No. We actually, we have a brief breakdown right now. I don't get any oh, well, we actually work with brokers. We're filled specifically for a home care group that we do a lot of partnership. It this is something that would So you'll notice that there was a little bit of confusion around the solution that Marissa was offering. But, otherwise, I would say her tone throughout the entire thing was really, really, really solid. She did her context upfront. She sounded like she actually took the time to research the prospect, and it sounded like she was joining the pain. Yeah. If she has a one sentence solution, I think this easily becomes three out of three a green tape. Yeah. I think I work with them, and this actually is a very, very common misconception folks will have when they're cold calling is they're calling about health benefits. And when she mentions benefits, they're like, oh, yeah. We work with an insurance broker. And so, actually, she does a really good job being like, wait. No. We do work with people who have brokers. And so, I think she does a good job catching that. She might include in her one sentence solution, you know, whether or not you work with a broker, we can typically help, and I think that would help have that not fall out from underneath her. Alright. So you just finished learning with your feet up just like the heard the name tossed around opener. It's time to do now. It's time for a little bit of homework to actually apply this material. So your homework at the end of this section is as follows. You already wrote out your opener, and you've been practicing that. Now it's time to do the same with your problem proposition. So take your opener, and now attach whatever problem proposition you wanna use using the principles we talked about, layering in descriptors, chunking up if necessary, including the one big problem or the three part problem depending upon what you sell, and now start to get some reps of that coming out of your mouth so that you can nail the tone, where you get the big emotion, where you get the shrug when you go for the meeting at the end. Start getting those reps, and we will see you on the next session, which is a recap of the first sixty seconds.
