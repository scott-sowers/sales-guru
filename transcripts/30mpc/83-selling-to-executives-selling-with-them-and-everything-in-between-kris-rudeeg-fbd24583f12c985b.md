## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh. I'm here with my host, Nick Sadowski. And today, we have the CEO of Sendoso, the one and only, the man that's sending stuff all over the place. Nick, why should people listen? Okay. Aside from the wonderful imagery of Armond packing up a cardboard box and licking stamps, Chris, like, talked about stuff like using VAs as a salesperson, putting intentionally sent from your iPhone in emails to make it a little bit more openable, and just some stuff that, like, is really creative. So this was a fun one, man. Three, two, one. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Bam. Alright, Chris. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Arman. Alright. Let's do this. So first three, Upwork smarter. So this is really outsource as much as possible to Upwork. For example, maybe there's a list online of a 100 top salespeople. You can get that cleaned up into a CSV in zero effort. Number two, sent from iPhone, leaving that in or purposefully adding that into sequences. And number three is find tools to make you faster. And, would love to get into some of these tools that are my favorite. Alrighty. So let's let's dig into number one here. So I had the the wonderful experience of when I was a rep, I was using a VA to do all of my call prep for me, pull the funding data, the employee growth, pull everything, like, all the different, like, people that I I'm gonna wanna multithread to later on, and it saves me multiple hours per week. What are other ways reps can use some sort of Upwork service to drive efficiencies in their day? Yeah. So I would say when you're prospecting, a lot of times you'll find these lists online, these listograms. Really quickly, you could say, hey. Put this into a CSV that then can be deduped against your CRM or it can be checked against things so that you can see, hey. These 18 people aren't even in our database yet or these 18 accounts aren't in our database. So I'd say find that. I'll often use Upwork to find LinkedIn profiles of people so that they can social interact with them and get that again while I sleep. The VAs are doing this for me. I've also had them if you're an early stage start up in sales, you're trying to just hack it in the early days, there's graphic designers on Upwork. You can say, hey. Clean up my deck. Here's all the content. Make it look pretty so you don't have to stress about, you know, the graphic design elements. I even, had someone build a software program that took a company's LinkedIn image. They're, late overlaid it on a, where's Waldo picture in, like, a little small area. And then as part of, like, the last step, you know, instead of, you know, when you get ghosted, you're like the hail Mary, last step in the sequence. It was like, hey. Like, where'd you go? Can't find you. By the way, if you could find where's Waldo on this picture, I'll send you $25, to Starbucks. And, you know, I'd also have their face in there too. And so they were like, that last step crushed it. It was like everyone responded to that. So, yeah, I I can go on and on. I think I've spent close to $200 on Upwork in the last ten years, while I was in AE and then while starting Sendoso. You're doing some really creative stuff with these sequences. The where's Waldo, descent from the iPhone. Can you talk about are there any other things that you're doing, like, sequence wise that are different than usual? I mean, one of the things that I think is different and creative is if we get into what we actually do as a company where I work at Sendoso, I think that adds a creative step too where you purposely try to find gifts or other things to mail out to prospects. And that, I think, is the ultimate creativity, whether it's, I had to do my research, and I saw you play golf, and I'm gonna send you some golf balls with your favorite sports team or alma mater. So I think that's a creative step that takes a lot of effort too. Just like you're kinda AB testing what emails to send, you kinda AB test what gifts to send, and you see what's working, you track the analytics, and you rinse and repeat. And I think a lot of salespeople will have, you know, a little chitchat, small talk before the call kicks off or even during the call, and that's a perfect time to, like, take that note and then use that in your your follow ups to build a rapport with that prospect. So I've seen the use of Sendoso, like, from a prospecting perspective. Arman's shipping golf balls all across the country. The use case I've used it most for is, like, when I have somebody in deal cycle where I meet with Chris. We have a really good demo, and he mentions, wow. I've got 47 other meetings today, and I don't have time to eat lunch. And, like, that sets off a trigger in my head that I'm sending Chris a DoorDash gift card Exactly. On Sendoso because I wanna be like, hey. You said you didn't have time for lunch. Like, get some sweet green or something. So, like, those are the two main use cases I think of with with, like, gifting anything. Are there other use cases that come to mind that you think salespeople should be leaning on more heavily? I think there's two others that come to mind. One is if you work in an environment where you have, VARs, channel sales, or even just integration partners, I think there's a big integration ecosystem. Go find the CSM or the AE that's at, you know, a partner company and be besties with them and get some deal flow that way. So I think leveraging them to build better rapport with partners is key. So I think that's, important. And then after the deal closes and you're kind of building rapport with that new customer, that that person is probably gonna leave and go to another place and, at some point. And so if you can still build rapport and keep that relationship alive, you're gonna get another chance to win them over at their next job or ask them for a referral or a reference. You know? Hey. Skip going to marketing and asking them for who's their best references. Just keep all the people that you've sold. Build be their best friends, and then use them as as your your references. I wanna dig into something that you just said a second ago, which was the idea of, like, gifting to, like, I don't know, channel partners or advisers or people in the same space because it's been something that's coming up, like, more and more recently, and it was something that you put in the prep doc, like, partnering with other organizations or advisers. Can you talk about how, like, an individual contributor could potentially do that to, like, maybe not to have to make as many cold calls as I do in a in a given week? Yeah. For sure. So I think they're I mean, most companies will have some partners. Or if you don't have any partners, there's oftentimes where you can see, hey. I sell into the same ICP as you. And go out and kind of form your more ICP related partnerships. And so I think in that case, it's a little thinking outside the box. But if sales reps love networking, and so if you can go find another sales rep or another account manager that's selling the same ICP, create your own partnerships. Hey. We sell a lot into the same accounts. Let's connect over a virtual call to see if we can help each other. Hey. By the way, I'll buy you lunch, and here's a $25 to Uber Eats. And so it's like, okay. That that seems like a very easy take that and run with it. So, Chris, I I wanna take this in another direction where we're talking about all this thing that we're doing to gift the folks to get their attention. And often, I'm using gifts to get the attention of my a tier accounts or the chief something officer, and that worked. K. So I get that first really awesome meeting. You are an AE, and now you're a CEO. Oftentimes, I struggle as a head of sales as to when I should be bringing my CEO in. So what's your perspective? I get that hot first meeting. I bring in on the first call to, like, drive top down alignment. Should I bring you in at the end to close the deal? What's the right way to win a deal with my CEO or with my executives? Yeah. So how I look at it is, I like to be brought in very early so that I can build some report early in the process. And whether it's just an email, a draft on behalf email where it's like, you know and that could be a stage one or stage two, just so that they see my name. If it's a a big deal and we wanna get me involved more to talk about vision, to talk about other things, I think that bring me in kind of mid stage, maybe during the eval stage. I think, specifically, outside of the CEO, depending on who you're selling into, if you sell into a CRO or a CTO or a CIO that's your main buyer, then go grab that person. You know, for us, we we oftentimes sell into CMOs and CROs. And so we say, hey. Do you wanna talk to our CMO to see how they use x y z? And so I think you can leverage the department head of who your ICP is to an extent. I prefer to get in early so that I can build some rapport and then bring me in in the middle of the deal so that I can actually add value. And then use me at the end if I've already done the beginning and middle so that it doesn't seem like a hail Mary. It seems like I'm coming back around to add some final value. Now let's say we get onto that call. So it's you and me. I'm a Sendoso AE. You're the CEO, and it's their chief revenue officer. And then whoever else has been involved in the sales cycle, maybe it's a head of sales ops or something like that. Oftentimes, my CEO will ask me, like, what role do you want me to play? Mhmm. Because it's tough to, like, do some back and forth along the way. So can you talk through, like, what is the back and forth in the meeting look like between you and the account executive? In other words, how do you co sell in the meeting? Yeah. So, typically, we'll have a a couple areas to prep for, which is, I think, important so that I know where are the areas of focus. Hey. Am I talking about our international growth? Hey. Am I talking about a couple, success stories in there that that I need to get them over the hump? And that's the goal of the meeting. So, typically, there'd be a goal involved, whether we've identified that they're not over the hump yet and they they wanna hear other success stories, whether they're worried about international expansion, whether they're much more forward thinking and and wanna hear about the vision and road map for the next couple months. Or in some cases, hey. What they wanna hear the founding story, and it's and they're they're just kind of curious on how it got started, and they're more so there's a a couple different ways to play it, but I think you have to have a goal of, like, what is the CEO gonna say? What areas of focus? And I think we have, like, five or six buckets that we try to bucket it into so that we can rinse and repeat a playbook. I'm seeing a lot of parallels because you're talking about things like international expansion, or maybe you're talking about road map. You're talking about the things that an AE might even be perceived to be a liar about. Mhmm. And so I'm doing the disco. I'm holding, like, the line on, hey. These are the problems that you've sought out to solve. And then the CEO is coming over the top and saying, like, hey. This is, like, why our business is built for your Exactly. In your Exactly. Along the way. Right? Exactly. Cool. So what happens when a deal goes bad? Right? How do you how do you resuscitate a deal that's going south? Yeah. So I'd say there's a couple ways that I would get involved there to resuscitate a deal, and I think this comes in to where if we've mapped some advisors or investors that have connections into that account, we can ask for maybe a higher level connection than we currently have or another connection to make an intro. So I'd say one is just trying to find another contact that maybe isn't going quiet. Two, I think it I can send a hail Mary, into the account too, and offer some kind of value, or offer a meeting. And, again, that works better if I've already established credit. I do I typically stray away from being the hail Mary CEO. I usually don't do that. I don't think that unless I've been a part of that conversation earlier on. I think maybe you can also ping partners at times. You can get some good account intelligence. Maybe they've gone dark. You say, hey, partner. You know, I know they're your customer already. Like, any insights? You know, does this person still work there? We even play dumb like that to see that. And I think you could might be able to get some account intelligence that way too. What a lot of people do is they only think of using partners to get that first referral. Mhmm. They're like, okay. My my my integration partners are lead gen folks. The moment they send me a lead, alright, we're good to go. But oftentimes, the best, best deals are the ones where it's like, hey. I'm about to multithread this one. I'm gonna go look at every single person's LinkedIn profile and see, do I have an investor that's connected to them? Do I have an integration partner that's going to be connected to them? And then what you're gonna do is you're gonna loop them in so that they're already evaluating Sendoso. They're feeling good about it, and then that partner comes in and accelerates the deal. Exactly. Now we have validation externally as well. Externally as well. A 100%. That that's a big part of our playbook. We we love trying to be get third parties involved, and and it just adds more, chances to for that deal to close. So, Chris, I'm I'm curious if we sort of flip flop the seats. Let's say your team's in selling, and I'm trying to sell to a CEO. Mhmm. Oftentimes, reps, they struggle to maintain the attention of a CEO for a variety of different reasons. They're caught in the weeds. They don't have exact presence, whatever it might be. And so maybe we'd say like, hey, when was the last time you bought software? And what did an AE do really, really well? Or what are some things that AEs commonly screw up that lose the attention of a CEO? Yeah. So I think the most important thing first is what stage is the company at? So when I was a seed stage company or you could maybe not even by you could say by size or seed. So when you're a 50 person company, the CEO acts in a way where they're probably making a lot of decisions. They're still buying software. If you're a maybe 200 person company that you're going after, maybe they're mid market, you know, you're it's questionable if that is the case. When you're a 500 to thousand person company, like, we're about 500 employees now, I've got c levels, VPs, directors in the mix. I don't make that many decisions anymore. I it's just not I've hired enough people to where everything else is delegated out. And so I think you've gotta be smart with what's your ask. If someone comes to me now and says, hey. I wanna demo you this software for HR for, for this sales software. I'm like, dude, like, not involved. Like, you're I I sometimes I wouldn't even if it if I I feel like they're not doing their homework, or they could say, hey. Just FYI, this might look interesting for you. I'm gonna go talk to x y z, your CRO. If you can nudge them along, please do. And then I'm like, okay. Cool. You really realize where I'm at and you understand, and I think that's helpful. Oftentimes, if they are referencing to me, my other teammates who are already involved or who they're about to get involved with, then I I'm fine with responding and and maybe adding my context. Well, I think what a lot of reps don't realize is, like, look. You're working an account. You've got 10 contacts on the account. And some of them actually might be, believe it or not, too far above the power line. They might be too far above the power line. If you're talking to a Fortune 500 company, my guess is the CEO probably isn't gonna buy Sendoso. That's just a wild assumption. A 100%. Right? But what you can do is literally to this date, Pave is an earlier stage company. We're just under a 100 employees. However, my CEO forwards me stuff all the time. Mhmm. And he Exactly. The ones that talk about things like, oh, we're gonna help your reps get you to your series c, for example, or they're talking about bigger business problems, and they're not asking him for a meeting. They're being like, hey. Could you get this on Arman's radar? And so Exactly. Do that always get forwarded over to me, and then I have to say no usually. Yeah. But especially if they've done their homework and they say, hey. Can you forward this over to Arman? It's like, boom. You've done your homework. You've already thought about this. You're not asking for the wrong thing. So are you guys seeing reps who are pros like, Chris, are people prospecting into you or Armand, are people prospecting into your CEO saying, hey. I don't want a meeting. Can you please forward this to insert the human being's name there? Mhmm. I'll see that probably a couple times a week. Wow. I've never done that, and I'm gonna have to start doing that. Yeah. Jeez. I think it it again, it varies on the stage. So we're at this stage of company where Matt I report directly into our CEO, Matt. And so, naturally, he still forwards stuff to me. For everyone listening to this episode, please do not go emailing my CEO for that right now. But then for the size of a Sendoso, a little bit bigger of a company, again, if we're selling, like, a niche HR software, that the version of that might be they reach out to your chief people officer or your CHRO for a referral to a director of people operations, for example. It always works. You can go one level above and get that referral. Well, it's really interesting you say that because so I sell to law firms, and there's times that I'll get in touch with the managing partner of a big law firm. And while that person is technically at the the top and they run the firm, they're not actually running the business operations. So, Armando, your point earlier, like, there's times I get a meeting with that person, and she's way too high for me in terms of the power line. And I'm spending time, like, trying to sell to this person. And I guess what you're making me realize I should be doing is just trying to figure out, like, who can you introduce me to at your organization? Oh, I saw Armond as your CFO. Like, would you intro me to Armond? And now I'm not, like, cold pushing anymore or trying to sell to someone who, like, doesn't really feel that pain. Exactly. And then, I mean, I get a 100% response when I forward an email internally to another employee. So you bet your butt they're gonna look into that email. So, Chris, I wanna go back to this topic of discovery. Right? Yeah. And let's say we're going back to the example of doing discovery for Sendoso. Right? So trying to sell someone Sendoso. Now Nick and I both have these interesting solutions where they can solve some massive problems for companies, but what can also happen is people can try to commoditize us and say, oh, you guys are just gonna save us a lot of time doing spreadsheets. Or for Nick, you're gonna help us with these operational time tracking tasks. Right? Or for Fundoso, they might say, oh, why can't my reps just USPS some socks, or why can't we use an executive assistant for that? And so when you go into these discovery calls, you're probably hitting on some bigger picture problems. How do you make it seem like something much bigger than, oh, it's we're just a replacement for your rep boxing stuff up via USPS, and how do you get them thinking bigger picture? Yeah. So I think a couple different ways. One is even before entering into the conversation, we spend a lot of effort just drumming up noise around the category and why you need this software. And so I think outside of just the the initial value add, we hope that over the course of years and years and decades in the future that it'll just become the norm to use our software. And so I think that is at the foremost front to help, solve that problem. But if we haven't gotten there yet and we're still in the trenches of how do we really kind of value based sell or ROI sell, I think we we will look at it in a couple of different ways. One is we can have some calculators to try to get them to see the value that way. So, hey. This if if you had 80 reps and they're all spending this many time and this much money, this like, actually get them to realize the value, which I think calculators can help with that. We tried to create a ton of case studies and videos and try to find someone that's a peer that could be a reference pretty early on. So it's like, hey. Don't take our word for it. The CRO over here is on video saying this or this VP of sales is willing to talk to you. Do you wanna hear it why they did it? And so I think the peer to peer in getting as much of that, I think we've got maybe 75 case studies. We've got, like, I don't know, 800 reviews on g two. So we've really put an effort into the peer to peer because in the early days, five years ago, no one used this software. We kinda created this software, this category, and so we really had to use peer to peer as a, a method to validate. So I think those are some of the the the ways that you can do it in my eyes. Well, similar to what you guys talked about with bringing an executive in earlier, not to, like, try to salvage a dying deal. Like, same thing with a reference. I used to only give references at the very end where the customer is just, like, checking a box. But anytime I got a reference involved early, it's like they do the selling for you. It's a real person who's a peer. I wanna talk a little bit about, like, the ROI calculator because that's something that I've used before. I sell to lawyers who bill by the hour. And if I can save Armand, the partner, five minutes a day, look at the ROI. But I struggle with them sometimes for two reasons. One, I don't really know how to actually, like, share it. Like, I always sort of struggle. I'm like, I'm gonna share my screen, and here's a Google Sheet. Oh, I don't know how to use a formula. And then, also, people sometimes don't believe me. And so I'm wondering, how are you guys actually executing on those ROI calculators? Yeah. So I think there's two ways. One is we have, like, kind of a customer facing one that you kinda do on your own, and then we have the the the Google spreadsheet one. And I think it's really you're you're asking them to make the assumptions. So I think there's a lot of input that where you can if you oversimplify it, you just say, oh, each hour is gonna you're gonna say blah blah blah. It's like, okay. What is this? What is that? What is this? What is that? So they're putting in, like, the 10 inputs, and I feel I feel like that ends up getting the conversation going and at least hopefully gets them over one of the humps of the ROI. I think outside of that, if it's pure you've also gotta talk, I think, bigger picture with, for us at least, it's okay. What is what is the long term strategy here? You're not gonna what's the cost of not doing this? And, you know, again, start selling a bit more of, like, what what if you bring on 10 more sales reps next month? How do you operationalize this? How much effort is it gonna take for them to start packing boxes? And so you start to paint this picture of, like, I didn't even think about that. And then it's like, yeah. Why don't we just save you time for the next year? This is gonna be way easier than than so I think you've you've gotta hit on the future and and and find other things that are gonna be pain points for them. Well, I'll hit on the packing boxes thing in a second because they back me up. But I hate to use a cliche here, but they always say people buy emotionally and then they justify it logically. And what you're doing is, to your point, you're starting with the vision and you're hitting on things like, look, all of your competitors are trying to break into the same accounts as you and they're pushing one button and a bottle of wine appears. Yeah. Your guys are packing boxes and licking stamps and stuff like that, and you're making it seem like the whole world is going in this direction. Right? Exactly. Bigger than them. And then what you're doing is you're painting the real logical picture of, do you realize how ridiculous it is to have 10 SDRs each getting paid an 80 k OTE or something like that, licking stamps to boxes of wine or whatever it is. And that's how you tie it together is you have to do both. You have to hit them with the emotional sale, and then you gotta hit them with the real numbers behind it to justify it afterwards. Exactly. I think you could even be quirky and fun. I mean, for us, we do too. It's like, you know, even just saying, like, can you imagine, like, what Nick's handwriting looks like? Do you want that in front of a prospect? You know? And then you gotta have fun with it, and they're like, you're right. I actually don't want Nick writing notes. He can't write for you know? There you go. I'm looking at it now. So It's pretty ugly. So I think there's other things where you can just be fun and quirky in the conversation to also, instill doubt into why they wouldn't wanna use you. Chris, this has been phenomenal. I I just can't get this picture of Arman packing up cardboard boxes and licking stamps out of my head, unfortunately. But we're running out of time, so we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really good things salespeople should be doing. Now let's talk about the opposite. The final question is what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople doing that you think they need to break because it's hurting them more than it's helping? I would say, if I had to think about it, maybe not doing, not using a channel because they're timid and they're they're lazy, like, phone. I I think use the phone. The phone's not dead. Or get on LinkedIn. It's LinkedIn's social selling is not dead. So I think the there's this misconception that some of these channels are dead, and that's not true. You gotta use every channel you could ever do to get a meeting or to close a deal. So don't be scared to use these channels that you know, some of these LinkedIn folks are saying are dead. And don't be afraid to use a Sendoso channel even. There you go. On that note, Chris, is there anything that you wanna plug before we jump off here? We're hiring. So if you're looking for jobs, you know, we got tons that we got recently raised, a 100,000,000 series c's, so lots of opportunities for, SCRs, AEs, AMs. You name it. We're hiring. Beautiful. Folks, send Chris a message if you're looking for a sales job. Thanks so much, Chris. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Chris Rudrap. Number one, you need to bring in your executives not to save the deal at the end, but bring them in early. You can use them to accelerate that deal cycle versus at the end the deal is already done. Number two, you need to sell the vision of your deal and talk about how the whole industry is going this direction, but then afterwards, you can justify it logically. Number three, when you're going after someone who is above the line or in fact, maybe even above above the line, what you need to do is not ask every single person for a meeting, but maybe ask the CEO or the CFO, hey, would you be open to sending this email or referring me over to this person?

Folks, I really wanna show Chris some love because not only was this a really good episode, he he helped us out with some other stuff related to thirty minutes to presidents club after the recording. And so if you got even a tidbit from this show, and, hopefully, if you're listening this deep into the episode, you got a tidbit, send him a note and let him know you heard him on the show and say thanks. We'll see you next week, folks, on thirty minutes to prize men's club.
