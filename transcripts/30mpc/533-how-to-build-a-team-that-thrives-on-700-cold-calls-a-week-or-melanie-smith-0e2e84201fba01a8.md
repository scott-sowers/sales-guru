## Transcript

As a team, we book 70% of our meetings over the phones. We use the phones for reps to do ground swell, especially in enterprise, but any type of larger mid market accounts where they will spend time calling SDRs, We sell to SDR teams to get information to understand how do you call today? What challenges do you have? Who are the right people I should speak to? That information is what they're then using to put in a hyper personalized message to a VP of sales development. Hey. I spoke to three reps at your team. I know you guys have a challenge with this. Here's exactly how Nux can help. So the dials aren't only to book meetings. That is obviously where we're successful. It's also to gather information that's maybe not available online. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to the president's club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm here with my host, Nick Skalski. And, folks, if you are an outbound leader, I could argue that this is the best outbound sales leadership episode we've ever done. Yeah. It is with Mel Smith. She is the head of sales development over at Nook's. Nick, why should people listen? Mel got into the tactical surgical nitty gritty of how she is managing the entire SDR org at Nook's. We got into things like the specific KPIs she is holding the team to prospect sequence, call volume, emails, etcetera. How those KPIs get regularly updated, spoiler alert, they change on a monthly basis. She talks about all the different strategies and levers they pull to increase their connect rate. So if you're having trouble getting prospects live on the phone, she's got some tech agnostic best practices around that. She talks about some of, like, the unique metrics that her team looks at on cold calls, like conversation rate, which is actually a metric I had not talked about before. And then we get into some really tactical plays that her team is running on a Friday readout to help close the loop of what plays are working, what are not, and getting her visibility into how the team is performing from a who are they booking with and why are we seeing success perspective. So phenomenal SDR leadership episode right here. In three, two, one, let's roll. Alright, Emile. Welcome to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. The first one is Friday stand up on an SDR team. Keep accountability and shared learnings. And so the most important thing, typically you'll spend an hour, it does take an hour, pull up every SDR's metrics directly on a share screen in front of the whole team and have each SDR speak to their numbers. So 90% of this is SDR speaking, 10% is leaders driving. They'll walk through their KPIs and if they hit them that week, and they'll also walk through every meeting that they booked that week, how they booked it, what channel, who they booked with, whatever type of quick story there is that another SDR could learn from to try to replicate. Boom. What's number two? Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a rep can't answer that question, the deal has a risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Using ChatGPT to analyze, identify, and come up with your enablement topics for the whole team. So very easy to use this for coaching on a low performing rep, but we also will throw in the last 10 transcripts of meetings that were booked from cold calls, ask chat IT what are the patterns that made those successful. That can now function as, coaching in one on ones or a broader team enablement session. So you would throw 10 of my calls in there, figure out what went well, and then you ask it, what could Nick do better on his calls? I completely agree. What's number three? Of all time. Yeah. Number three is just as a leader really owning the career path for your team outside of the ordinary. So, a lot of people have really clear paths for the AE world. Commonly, we have folks that wanna move to the CS path. So you as a leader need to go meet with the head of that department. For us, it was customer success. Identify and understand, number one, do they believe in promoting from your team? If the answer is yes, what exactly are the skill sets that they think that they need to look for? Both externally, but then also internally. And then brainstorm what are the things that SDRs on your team can do today that helps them gain some of that skill set. So for customer success, that could be running coaching and enablement sessions, That could be pulling data from trials that they might be supporting and building ROI documents. There's a whole bunch of things you could put together. So, Mel, I wanna talk about this Friday meeting that you have. What are the metrics that you are looking at for each rep? Rep? Yeah. So our weekly KPIs are number of net new prospects sequenced. I don't know if you want me to give specific numbers. I'm happy to. Yeah. That'd be awesome. I'd love if you can. Yeah. So we do 60 net new prospects sequenced. 700 calls per week. We Nuxe is a dialer, so we get to do a lot. 30 hyper personalized emails. Mhmm. And your goal is to be booking two to three meetings a week. What do you do when you have people that are like, hey. My LinkedIn activity is driving new meetings, or I really wanna start sending more personalized videos, or, hey. I wanna try gifting. I need to change some of my numbers or those should get on the list. List. So what do you do when there are activities that may be meaningful and SDRs wanna add to the scope of what's looked at in these metrics meetings? So two things I'd share. One is we change the expectations of those weekly KPIs once a month. We will pull the KPIs of anyone that hit quota from the month before, both are now the new KPIs. So it is moving depending on what is successful rather blanket forever a number that was made up at some point in time. The second thing I would say is at the end of the day, if an SDR is coming to stand up and they booked two to three meetings, I don't necessarily care where your activity came from. That's where walking through how they booked the meetings becomes more important because there's learnings and lessons there. If you can do less and get what you need, that's the goal for anyone. How have your metrics and KPIs changed month over month over month over month? I'm curious about some trends that you might be seeing. Yeah. It's it's not that dramatic. Transparently, like, calls fluctuate a hundred, two hundred and fifty. Probably, there's, like, seasonality you look at or different things on the team. Net new prospects, have been pretty steady between like 60 to 75, typically this year. Those numbers depend on how you do your territories, your books of business, etcetera. It's not dramatic, but I think the point of changing it isn't necessarily about what the number is. It's buy in from the team that you're not blind Right. To pull up a number. These are like these this is what made someone successful. There's something that, like, gives reps a little bit more buy in to why they're going towards those numbers. So I wanna come back to the meeting readout in just a second. If I read back your activity metrics or your KOIs, you have 60 prospects, 30 hyper personalized emails. So half of those prospects are getting pretty tailored emails, and then 700 cold calls, which is, like, kind of nuts. Even with, like, a parallel dialer, I was like, that's a lot of cold calls. I'm curious. Where is most of your SDRs time going in terms of how they plan their day Mhmm. Versus where do most of the meetings come from Mhmm. Based on that activity? As a team, we book 70% of our meetings over the phones. That is why we do so many calls. We use the phone in two ways. So one is obviously you're gonna try to book meetings. The second though is we use the phones for reps to do ground swell, especially in enterprise, but any type of larger mid market accounts where they will spend time calling through a company, calling SDRs. We sell to SDR teams to get information to understand how do you call today, what challenges do you have, who are the right people I should speak to. That information is what they're then using to put in a hyper personalized message to a VP of sales development. Hey, I spoke to three reps at your team. I know you guys have a challenge with this. Here's exactly how Nook's can help. So the dials aren't only to book meetings. That is obviously where we're successful. It's also to gather information that's maybe not available online. Can you break down that play a little bit more? Because that's really interesting. I'm curious. Everything from, like, are they mixing ground swell dials with above the line dials? Are they, like, batching ground swell dials so they're they're in that mode? And then I'm curious when they get good intel from a rep, what do they do? Do they ask for a referral? Do they just ask for permission to use the intel? Like, what does that whole play look like beginning to end from the first style? It is blocked. I'm trying not to just, like, pitch our product that helps do a lot of this. But it is blocked. So we we have, like, our master sequences. That's key personas that could include above the line and below the line people. We have separate sequences that are info gathering that they would put one in that they're probably not gonna book a meeting with, but they're trying to get information from. The goal always is to try to ask for a referral or an introduction. That is, like, not always gonna happen, obviously. They'll you it will be a block. Like, you can filter basically to say I'm only gonna call like, right now, this hour, whatever it may be, I mentally am just going and trying to gather information on the accounts that I don't have any information on. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. They've got different lists that they are calling off of. It sounds like you're calling that a block. And so they might say, for this hour, I'm uploading this list of SDRs at companies that are tagged, don't have intel on, and their whole mindset there is, like, get intel, get an introduction. And then maybe on another dial blitz, they're just focused on reaching out to whatever SDR leaders or CROs, the people that they're they they they actually wanna book meetings with. Do you do you encourage your SDRs to book meetings with the, like, intel gathering folks, or do you see that as more of a waste of time? No. They're they they cannot book those to an AE time Got it. Okay. Calendar. If they wanna book their own fifteen minute call, like, feel free. But, typically, like, even for us, any cold call that you our cold calls are, like, twelve to fifteen minutes. We're not in, like, the two minute, three minute cold call mark. You're understanding whether there's a true fit here or not before you book. Never. So your team is making 700 cold calls a week. What cold call metrics do you track to make sure those cold calls are effective? Yep. So we look at connect rate, conversation rate, and meeting booked rate. I'll also share our, like, metrics we're looking for. Connect rate, should be over 7%. If it's under that, we're probably, like, diving into why. Conversation rate is 35%. This is all on a two minute threshold, by the way. Any call that's under two minutes would doesn't matter, in my opinion. Like, anything can happen in sixty seconds. So 35% conversation rate and then a 15% meeting booked rate. That is a really high connect rate. And, honestly, a really high conversation rate too. To be able to get seven connects on a 100 cold calls, and then to be able to take one in three of those past two minutes is really, really good. Let's start with connect rate. How do you get your connect rate that good knowing that I do believe that Nook's has some functionality around smart dials and lists, but there are probably other things that you're doing in addition to that too. Yeah. Yeah. There's a couple things. I'll try my best to be product agnostic and just, like, best practice for anyone that doesn't, obviously have Nook's. You need to be able to understand if you're come coming up as spam. So, like, all this is automated in our tool. But, prior I was a client of Nook's before joining Nook's. So prior to even having Nook's, like, my reps would just call each other to be like, am I coming up as spam? So, like, have multiple numbers, understand if you're coming up as spam as frequently as you can, if that's not automated in your system. Data provider, like, we all bane of our existence. We have waterfall enrichment from a bunch of them, but make sure you have the proper data. Are you having net new people? So, like, that KPI on a weekly basis of net new prospects is the most important KPI I would ever care about personally. You have just have the highest chance of connecting and converting in your first, like, six touch points on a new prospect. Those would be the main things for connect rate, I'd say, off the top of my head. Do you do anything in terms of timing your reps' dials? I know some people are, like, very, very pro. Oh, you gotta call between 03:15 and 04:20 because that's when there's a spike in pickup rate. I'm not sure your stance on that or what you've seen the data show. Yeah. So we also monthly try to look at we have two dedicated call blocks a week. We look monthly at data to, like, what, day of the week and time of the day has our highest connect rate, and we'll just shift our call blocks accordingly. With your team getting this volume of conversations and meetings from cold calls, I know there are some teams that have centralized their email function with, like, a growth marker using a variety of different email tools. And then they, like, basically just have their SDRs call and call nonstop as if someone else was doing the tailored first touches. I'm curious if you've thought about that model, if you have perspectives on that versus if you like your SDRs to be doing the first touch points over email. My preference point of view, if you will, would be for an SDR to own all of it. I think there's something really different, about a marketing email versus, like, a sales email. I also think selfishly, from a skill set development standpoint, like, if I just were to think of the SDR and my job is to help them in their career, Like, if they only call and then I'm gonna put them into an account executive job, which, like, when I was in AE, a lot of my deals were closed over emails. I think they're just missing a core skill set development if they're not doing that part of the role personally. Yeah. If the first time you're writing an email is when you're closing a deal, it's probably a little bit too late. Conversation rate. How are you getting that metric to 35%? Because I think a lot of people would love to have one in three of their calls go longer than two minutes. Yeah. So two things I'll share. One, the unfair truth. It depends who you sell to. We sell to as leaders. Right? Think about that. You're talking to someone who's coaching their team to make cold calls. We probably have a slightly better opportunity to keep someone on the phone versus if you're calling a developer, for example. Mhmm. Mhmm. Push that aside. I do think because we can get such a high connect rate, like, the team just has more at bats. Historically, like, without a parallel dialer, if you're only getting three connects in a week, maybe you can get one of like you're just on your back feet. And so I think the ability to get the conversations is increasing the connect rates and giving the at bats. And then a lot of it too, like for us, we obviously, because of what we sell, like we focus really heavily on cold call skill set. Like you have to do two mock cold calls in our interview process. We have bots that you have to practice with in your onboarding. And so, yeah, I think it's just because it's such a focus of us because successful there. We're pretty good on the phone. Other than volume, I'm curious if you take a rep who has a 40 to 50% conversation rep versus a rep who has maybe 15% conversation rate. What is the difference between the reps who are able to pull conversations longer versus the ones who get hung up on more quickly? I don't know if this is good advice I should be spreading in the world, but, like, the my reps that book the most meetings that can keep people on the phone longest have the ability to respectfully ignore the initial I'm busy. Mhmm. So, no, we don't wanna ignore prospects. We need to, like, understand where they're at and be respectful of their days. We're calling them out of the blue. Mhmm. But, yeah, the the top reps are the ones that are, like, totally understand it's obviously a cool call, and then continue with the conversation. Yeah. Perhaps that are, like, a little bit too nice, they're really nervous about disrupting someone's day. A 100% of a cold call is disrupting someone's day. That's the reality. And so accepting that and being able to talk through it, that that's the main difference that I I think I'd seen. Yeah. A lot of times, what salespeople will do is they will take the meaning. They will interpret what the prospect says in a way that gives them an out on the conversation. You're right. You are interrupting somebody's day, and so they're gonna say, ah, this is really busy time. And I think a lot of folks get into sales because they generally have higher EQ than maybe their peers. Yep. And if I call Armand and say, hey. You wanna grab lunch? And he goes, oh, I'm really busy. I'm gonna take that as, like, his nice way of saying, I don't really wanna get lunch with you. And I think sometimes salespeople translate that then into the cold call where it's like, Arman's not interested. Yeah. I'm I'm gonna exit this call. And it sounds like they say they almost use the improv thing of yes and where it's like, you are busy. And, again, the reason that I called you is and they keep it going. And that's really uncomfortable because it feels Yeah. But I remember my first ever CRO. I remember at sales kickoff, I was lucky enough to get a shout out, and I still remember it. It really meant a lot to me. Oh. And I remember him like, he complimented me, and he was like, and, Nick, I want you to I remember he was saying, like, you're gonna be an even better rep if you get a little bit more aggressive. He's like, I want you to think about the spectrum of passivity to aggressively. He said this from the whole stage. He said nice things about me, but he said, but for you to get elite, you've gotta almost go a half step further than what feels comfortable for you from an aggression standpoint Mhmm. Which doesn't mean that we're, like, pushy or rude or hateful or, like, bull rush them. But I think for a lot of folks, it does feel a little bit uncomfortable to do that. Our goal is to get a prospect to smile or laugh in the first thirty seconds. So, we like, sometimes in our openers, I'll have SDRs be like, listen, if I'm totally off the mark, tell me to kick rocks. Or like so we play we play a little bit because that sometimes can open people up. And and to your point, Nick, like, the other thing I think that I try to do a lot is any again, most SDRs wanna become AEs or move on to somewhere else, like some other path, tying anything that they're learning and practicing in their current job to future jobs, you as an AE need to be able to push back on prospects at some point. Practice that now where there's like way low stakes, you don't have a $10,000 commission check on the line. So, yeah, I think bringing it back to like, I'm asking you to push here because it's a skill set development. It's not just because I blindly want you to, like, bulldoze a prospect, book a meeting, is meaningful. So let's go back to how you're tracking the meetings that SDRs have booked, and then let's talk about cold call onboarding camp. So you're having your SDRs read out all of their metrics and every single meeting that they've booked. Could you explain what goes on during that readout of all of the meetings they've booked? Yep. So they walk basically, what's shared on screen is the company name and what channel they booked through. So cold call email or LinkedIn or otherwise, but those are the primary things. Like an Excel sheet, a PowerPoint presentation, something else? We right now do put it in a spreadsheet. That's more of like me as a leader hating change. It's all it exists in our CRM. It exists in Nook's. Yeah. I'd probably just pull up that. But right now, it is in the spreadsheet. Okay. Yeah. So yeah. They pull up, that spreadsheet, and they're talking through how they booked the meeting. So it could include a story of I spoke to three SDRs earlier this month and found out that, they use a competitor right now and the bridge time sucks or whatever it may be. So I emailed to the VP of, SDR, they introduced me. So it's like how exactly did they book it, and then specifically who they booked with. Because to me, predominantly we're booking with SDR leaders, there's adjacent, folks that you can book with operations enablement. So it's only, like, twenty, thirty second storytelling, as other people on the team can ask questions. What's the order that you go in? Is it the person that booked the most, the person that booked the least, alphabetical, something else? We popcorn. Okay. That's what it's called. So, like Yeah. We'll say who wants to start, and then corn. Okay. That's what it's called. So, like Yeah. We'll say who wants to start, and then they just call the next person to to go next. This makes sense because if you hear an SDR team read out 20 meetings and the persona and method that booked every single one of them, you'll start to notice two things. One, you're gonna notice that there are certain personas that come up all the time or don't. Like like, wow. None of these people are, like, sales enablement analysts, for example. We should probably never call those people. So you're gonna see the clustering of the personas. You're also gonna see what typically isn't working. Mhmm. And then with the method, you're also going to see the moment someone figures out a new trick or a new way of messaging or you've been testing a new play, you're gonna be able to see if that play actually worked versus most of the time people just run plays, and they never actually get that haptic feedback on, like, what happened in that play. Should we use that play to, like, go get more prospects in the future? And so this is what closes the loop between the activities and the outputs. It's basically what tells you this should tell you what activities you should do next week based on the meetings you booked. Yep. The other thing too we'll add to that, like, so being now in a lot of my time is in second line leadership, so I'm not in the weeds with every SDR. I make sure I go to every stand up because I get here exactly what's in the front line and what's working and not working, which is super valuable for me when I go to a leadership meeting on a Monday, and they're like, how's it going? And instead of just having data, I actually can understand what's happening without having to go to all my managers. So it's, like, double effective for me. I'll never forget. I I went into a product meeting with our chief product officer and our CEO of Rep Pave. And it was the first time I was a VP of sales, and I had two managers managing two reps on key enterprise deals. And it was the first time my CEO looked at me. He was like, Armand, I don't know if you know what's going on in this customer conversation, or I don't know if you actually know what's going on the ground level on the product. I think you might need to bring the reps in the room for that. And that was like, shoot. This is the gap that I had when I stepped back from pipeline reviews. I didn't figure out how to continue to get that ground intel from my reps Uh-huh. Without literally being in every single deal. And I never thought about that. The team meetings, the stand ups, the forecasting meetings, the pipeline reviews are naturally the place where you get to see across all the deals and all the meetings. Mhmm. And so that is an extremely high value use of your time as a director or a head of or a VP when you're managing managers. That's your way to figure out what the entire team is doing in a single meeting. So how did you solve for that, Armand? Did you then just, like, start popping in on random pipeline reviews, or did you do something else? I didn't start popping in on random pipeline reviews because those almost get two in the weeds. I built a deal threshold where any deal over a certain amount, I at least needed to be notified and probably needed to be brought in. So there was just a certain deal size where Yeah. At the beginning, it was over 50 k, and then eventually, it got bigger, where I was always going to at least be deeply in the know on what was going in going on in those deals. And Pave was trying to expand to mid market and enterprise, and that's where most of the product focus was going. That is where I needed to know about what was going on in those deals to inform product. Mhmm. Yeah. Cool. Cool. Well, I guess, Mel, let's talk last about the onboarding plan that you have for these folks on cold calling. It sounds like you're making them do some mock cold calls in the interview, but I'd love to hear, like, what onboarding looks like for these SDRs. Yeah. So we correct. Due to they do two mock cold calls in the interview. One is with the hiring myself or, like, one of my managers. The second is with a bot. We have a free bot on our website. He's very mean, but easy to use. And then during onboarding, I think the two I'll say three important things. So one actually is very unique. Historically, at Nook's, I've mostly hired SDRs that had SDR prior experience. And so our onboarding was a week for my first year here, because we hired people that came in that knew what they were doing. It's a week and a half. We have a couple more junior people. They are they have to we have AI bots, basically for cold call practice. So they have to practice with an AI bot three times a day for their first two weeks, and they also have to be on our Virtual Sales Floor for two hours a day. And so they're listening by the time they get through week one, they've probably listened to 90 calls from reps on my team that have booked just naturally from being in our Sales Floor. And the third thing I'd say is we have people build their cold call script on day three in the business. And it's not because they're gonna use it right away, but I find if they have spent the time to mentally write down what they think they're gonna talk about, when they listen to those 90 to a 150 calls, they're gonna be paying attention very differently than if they're just sitting on the sales floor blindly listening and, like, not really knowing or piecing things together. So those are the top three things, I think, related to cold calls. And the final question is, we talked about a lot of good habits, specifically when running outbound sales teams. What is the biggest outbound sales team sin that every single sales leader should break immediately so that you can actually go book some meetings? AI cannot replace your sales reps in my opinion. So, you need to use AI to analyze and identify things for you in order to, like, create efficiency and give your team time back to do the personalized outreach, to do the custom Loom video, or write the really great email. That's what AI should be used for, to give your team time back to actually do those types of things, not try to speed up everything and just increase volume. Boom. Mel, this was the greatest cold calling leadership episode I've ever heard. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, Nick. It is time for a three step recap and one thing you can do. Alright. Three step recap. This is gonna be a tough one because there was so much good stuff in it. Mel's six operating metrics for SDR teams. 60 prospects, 700 cold calls a week, 30 emails. How do you know that those cold calls are going well? 7% connect rate, 35% conversation rate, 15% meeting set rate. That's number one. Number two, every single week, you're gonna have your SDR team read out how they did against those metrics, and then they're going to recap every single meeting they booked. Specifically, look for the persona that they booked the meeting with and looked for the way that they booked the meeting as well. And then lastly, number three, when you're onboarding your team, the way you get your team to dial is number one, they have to practice against the cold calling bot for two hours a week. Number two, they have to sit in the Digital Sales Room listening to other people dial for two hours per day. And then number three, on day three of onboarding, your rep should be building their cold call script. And the reason for that is as they're listening to those calls, if they've taken the time to write down their script, they will listen to those calls so much more in detail than if they had no idea what was going on or if they were hearing the script for the first time. Alrighty, Nick. What's one thing people can do right now? So Mel talked about this interesting strategy on this episode around calling folks that are below the line for either intel or introductions to the stakeholders they actually wanna book meetings with. I was sitting here being like, shoot. I should have done that when I was selling to law firms, Armond. I recommend if you are having trouble breaking into certain accounts and you've got some space for some extra outbound calories, giving a shot to calling for intel or intros, the INI call block, and seeing, can you break into some key accounts that way? Thanks for listening, folks. We'll see you next week on the show.
