## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to Presidents' Club. My name is Arman Froak, and I'm back with my co host, Mark Koskalo. Mark, it has been a minute since we've had you on the show, and I'm stoked to have you back because we are talking with Adam Caroll. If you don't know Adam Caroll, you might know one of his business partners who is a four to five time hall of fame guest on 30 MPC, Ian Konjac, who was the number one all time producer at Salesforce. They work together. And Adam is a multiple time VP of sales. He was VP of enterprise sales over at FullStory. He was head of enterprise sales and strategic sales at Recurly, then VP of sales at FullStory, and now he is the founder over at Carroll Sales Consulting. And this is an episode all about how to tactically coach your reps every single week. Mark, why should people listen? Yeah. I think that coaching is one of two things, intentional or ineffective. Then I think what Adam does a really good job of is giving us tactical easy ways to make it intentional, and intentionality always brings success. Alrighty, Adam. Welcome to the show. We start every show with your top three actionable leadership takeaways. Let's get your three. Alright. Number one. So coaching doesn't happen without a plan. Every frontline sales manager I know at the moment is being stretched in all different directions. There's CRM updates, forecast updates, client fire drills, internal meetings, all these kind of things. And what gets deprioritized is high quality, consistent coaching. To overcome that and to make sure you are delivering coaching, you need to have a plan. I have a framework for a coaching plan. The acronym is IDEA. I is for Identify Coaching Themes. So you might find that someone on your team needs a lot of work around discovery and asking higher quality, more in-depth pain questions. The D is for delivering the coaching, and that's actually walking through with the rep and providing a specific example. Here's where you asked the prospect about the pain, but there was an opportunity to go deeper with that. And here's some other questions that you could have asked to better quantify what that pain and the impact was. The E is for ensuring action. So that's making sure that you're not just giving the coaching, you're setting actions for that rep. So for discovery, for an example, it could be giving them a list of sample questions, working through it with them and making sure that either in a role play or on their next discovery call, they're actively putting those into place. And then the a is assessing and measuring. Did they actually put those into place? How did they go? What metrics and KPIs did it impact? What's number two? Number two is immediacy equals impact. So hopefully, managers out there know the importance that when they give a piece of coaching or feedback, the sooner it can be put into practice in the wild, the better. What a lot of managers I'm finding are underestimating is the window they have for that adoption. So in my experience, it's gotta happen within twenty four hours. So if you're not giving that coaching and then giving an opportunity or setting up an opportunity for the AE to put it into place within twenty four hours, it's not likely to stick. It's not likely to drive behavior change. What that means is let's use the discovery example again. If you've given some coaching to one of your reps on discovery, and it's a Thursday afternoon, and the next morning, they've got a discovery call with the prospect. Fantastic. Put ten minutes in their calendar and review that call with them straight afterwards. However, it might be that their next discovery call with a prospect isn't till Tuesday after the weekend, five days away. So what you wanna do in that case is get them adopting it sooner, and that might be a role play with yourself. It could be that they record a role play with one of their teammates. It might be that they use one of the new AI tools out there to role play with a it doesn't matter. They need to put it into place, and then you need to make sure that that's happening. And that's what's really gonna, drive impact and drive behavior change. Alright. Bring it home. What's number three? Number three is measure adoption and not just measure the end outcome. Any coach, it should be driving towards an end business outcome. That's gonna be increasing overall pipeline. It's gonna be influencing win rates and revenue booked. But for a lot of companies, the lag time is months. So you don't wanna give coaching and then wait three months to see did that coaching actually work. You wanna make sure it's getting adopted and you wanna make sure it's getting adopted in the right way. So we'll keep using this discovery example, but if you provide some coaching on discovery, if you set some actions, some of those micro KPIs that you might set is, can you increase the number of pain questions you're asking on average on a discovery call from 4 to eight, for example? What percentage of deals have quantified pain? The moment it's fifty percent. We we need that number to be eighty percent. And then looking more at kind of deal progression, did the stage two to stage three conversion rate increase by x percent? And you have those things, you're gonna know that you're gonna be comfortable and confident that the coaching is being adopted. Alright, Adam. I wanna dig into this framework a little bit. The first thing that you talked about was, hey. If you have a plan, you're more likely to do it. But I don't know if having a plan creates more time for you. Managers still have the forecast call, the CRM updates. Like, how do you coach a sales leader, a sales manager, an org to find the space to run the plan? Because that's the real hairy part of it. Too many managers try and squeeze coaching in when they do have time. And then coaching happens in an ad hoc way when they have time, when they've got that twenty minutes to listen to a call and hop on a call with one of their reps, or it just gets kicked down the road. It may not necessarily create more time for you, but what it will do is create some accountability, most importantly for yourself to ensure that it happens. But also if you have a documented plan with every rep, and maybe you're sharing that with your sales leader as well, there's accountability for everyone. So it is far more likely to happen. Let's say that you're helping, an org that has three managers and 25 reps. What are you saying to that manager? Hey. You need to set aside four hours a week for coaching. Are you saying, listen. Mondays and Fridays, we're gonna have team meeting. Like, give me the way that you would structure it so that as a sales leader, I'm dictating to my managers what they're gonna do, not just hoping that they're gonna do it. It's exactly that. It's setting aside based on the amount of reps they have, based on their sales motion, how many hours a week that manager needs to carve out for coaching. And that will include things like how many calls they're gonna listen to and how much time they're gonna spend on those calls. It's how frequently they're gonna give that feedback to each rep. Is it every week? Is it every other week? And is that feedback going to happen in a stand alone individual coaching session? Is it going to be part of a one to one? It's going to vary from company to company, but the critical thing is that there is a plan, and that cadence is very clear to everyone and the expectations are very clear. So when I was at CRO at Catalyst, we had what we called skill building Friday or something like that, I think it was. And on Fridays, we would have an hour long meeting where we do a coaching session. Other than that, coaching was done a little bit ad hoc and, like, on request. How would you tell me to change what I'm doing to be more effective with coaching? Because I know that our reps were gaining skills, but I don't know if they were getting the individualized coaching that they always needed. The first thing I would do is for every frontline manager at the start of the quarter, I would instruct them to go away and and carve out a full couple of days and build their coaching plans. And what they're going to come back to me is, is a coaching plan for every AE, and they're going to have identified specific themes for each AE or development areas that they're going to work on, put the plan in place, and then to have a schedule. And what that schedule is going to look like, I want them to block out two hours every week at a minimum to be listening to their team's calls. And they're going to have a cadence where their team sends them a call every week, Friday, 12PM, whatever it is. And the manager is gonna have two hours blocked out to review those calls. And then they're gonna have every week, thirty minutes set aside, either standalone or as part of that rep's one to one, where they're gonna go through the coaching themes that they've discussed, examples from the call that the AE sent through, and they're gonna set new actions for the next week. That is a minimum. If if you're not doing that and you can't find that four or so hours a week, then you're not gonna be a successful manager. You're not gonna drive maximum performance from your team. So I've got two hours of calls that I gotta review. I gotta make sure that my reps aren't just sending me sixty minute demo calls, and they're like, look at it. When I go ask my reps to send me calls, how prescriptive are you being? What are you telling them to send you? Super prescriptive. Because the most frustrating thing and why I feel a lot of managers don't utilize these call recording tools as effectively they can is that they just jump in when they have time and find whatever call they can or whatever random call they represent them. They get twenty minutes in and they're like, this isn't a good call to be giving feedback on. They get frustrated. It needs to be at a certain time every week. There's a deliverable, there's a reminder. And for each AE, it should be based on what the coaching theme is. If John is great at discovery, not good at setting the next step at the end of the discovery call, he's going to send you an example of how he does that. Maybe it's a good call, maybe it's a bad call, but you're going to give him feedback on that. If Sally is having trouble with her pricing and proposals, she's going to send you an interesting pricing and proposal call. And you need to also be prescriptive of what you're looking for. You don't always want the slam dunk where the call went really smoothly. You want the call where Sally got some interesting feedback on pricing. Sally was kind of stumped by something that the prospect said. So if you set really clear expectations and set an action every week for your team, you're gonna be really efficient with that two hours when you're reviewing calls. Yeah. It's really important that you, number one, set a theme. What type of call do you want? Is it a negotiation call? Is it a demo call? Is it an executive presentation? That's number one. The other two things that I love to have sellers send me is number two, send me a time stamp. So a time stamp of where you feel like the critical one, two, or three moments were within that call, where things went really well or really poorly. And then three, give me your point of view, and this is how you can actually test for the adoption and conscious competence. If you told a rep, hey. You need to go deeper on pain questions or you need to go deeper on impact questions. They know that's the theme. They should be able to identify in this discovery call. At minute, I could have asked an impact question, but I didn't watching my own tape back. And then your job as a manager becomes 10 times easier because all you need to do is go to minute 10 and say, you got yourself diagnosis perfectly correct. Go work on that thing. The the time stamp's really important because in two hours, you're not gonna be able to listen to all of every single call. So if you're getting a time stamp, you can maybe listen to the you wanna listen to how the call was set up, but you can listen to it on higher speed. Then you can really drill in on what that five kind of minute chunk of the call where they've time stamped and they've already kind of self diagnosed and asking for feedback. And then you can speed up the rest of the call. And then you're really gonna be focused on what you're trying to develop with them, getting their self diagnosis and self coaching as well. So we've started to take a theme. The way that you figure out themes is you require your reps to send you a call every single week with a time stamp on the thing that you're coaching them on, and that helps you identify and track themes. Good on that. Right? Second is deliver. Like, you're delivering the coaching. Help us understand that happens on a cadence of you said about a half hour every single week with every single rep. Is there anything else that someone needs to know about delivering the coaching to finish out that d concept? No. Except that you're gonna identify the theme, and it might be you you work on that theme for a month, and you're gonna deliver at the beginning of that month the specific feedback. Hey. I don't think you're asking enough discovery questions or you're asking great questions to identify the pain, but then you're not pushing on the wound. Here's a couple of examples when you've done that and there was an opportunity to go deeper. Here's some metrics on how many questions you're asking and here's some really good examples. So, you know, what excellent looks like of how the top three reps in the company do that exact thing. And that's how the coaching is delivered. And then do you stay on a theme until somebody fixes it? Yep. Or after a month, you're just like, listen, they're not gonna get any better. And at that point, are you thinking, hey, maybe this isn't a good fit? What happens if they're not getting better? The theme could be two weeks, and it's something simple. Someone not leaving the call without scheduling the next step. That can be done pretty easily. So they might get through that in two weeks, and then it's on to the next theme. I've worked with reps, and if they're not getting it after a month, you need to figure out, am I doing something wrong with the coaching? Do we need to try a different approach with the coaching or is this rep just not getting it? And if they're not getting it and it's a really critical thing like multi threading or pipe generation or discovery, cold calling, then I need to have a hard think about is that rep gonna make it in the long run? What metrics or KPIs are indicating that they will be successful? Because there's a big red flag with something that I've spent a lot of time on them on that's mission critical that they're not getting. So the e in idea is ensure they do it. Alright. So I'm a rep. I have six call discovery calls this week. I'm working on my discovery call questions. I send you one call that week. The one where I actually tried it. The other five of it didn't even do anything with it at all. That doesn't sound like they're in how are you ensuring that they do it in at scale when you have eight reps as a manager? Yeah. So it might be that that person is not gonna send me just one thirty minute discovery call. They're gonna send me three snippets from three different calls of them doing that thing. And and you've got to be really clear on what the action is. It's doing that thing. But it might be doing that thing. But before you even have those calls with the clients, we're gonna do a role play. Or you're gonna do a role play with one of your teammates and record it and send it to me, and then we're gonna review it. The action's not always what's happening on the prospect call. It's what's leading up to that. It could be even something as simple as, here's our discovery cheat sheet. Here's 15 questions that are sample questions. I want you to come back to me tomorrow and tell me what are the three that you're gonna implement on your next call. So it's a mix of assignments, role plays, doing stuff on a call with a prospect, and it'll change from kinda theme to theme and rep to rep. Adam, I would love to dig in here and give the audience some ideas or inspiration for ways that you can coach your rep other than saying go role play discovery because that was really interesting. I never thought about going through a list of the 15 discovery questions and being like, oh, pick your three questions and the one that you're gonna try on your next call, for example. So maybe you could share from what you've seen coaching teams yourself, what are three common problems you'll see reps have? Yep. And then what are three potential prescribed practice plans you would give them? Yep. We'll talk about discovery. We'll talk about multi threading, and then we will talk about using give to get to progress a deal. With discovery, there's a lot of different things you can do. We've talked about role play. I think that's fairly straightforward. We've talked about reps sharing examples of their calls for you to give feedback on. But another thing I like to do is Sally needs to get better at discovery and asking impact questions. I want Sally to go and listen to one call from Greg, one call from Kate, and one call from Bob, and come back. And not just say, hey, I like this call or I didn't like this call, but give me very specific feedback. Complete a scorecard. What questions did you like? Mhmm. What questions didn't get asked that you would have asked? So it's forcing them to think about their own discovery and what they would do so that when they actually get on a discovery call, those seeds are in their head. Something like multi threading might be a little bit different, and I like to give assignments. An assignment might be, you've got this deal that's multi department, multi stakeholders starting to get some traction. What I want you to do is map out the buying group. Map out not just who the key stakeholders you've talked to, but try and find me five people that we haven't talked to that are likely to be involved in influencing this deal. And then let's go back and validate this with your champion on who the key stakeholders are, what their level of, sentiment is at neutral, advocate, detractor, and who's got the most power. So you're giving them an assignment, and part of that they're gonna do on their own, and you're gonna help them with it. And part of it, they're gonna hop on a call with their prospect and build that out. And that's how they're going to learn to map stakeholders and and figure out how to multi thread. And the third one was give to get. Again, I'm going to ask them to map out on this deal. What are three or four things you're gonna get asked for at different stages of the deal? It might early on, it might be MSA. It might be sent through a demo recording, like, really lightweight stuff. It might be pricing. And as the deal goes on, it might be case study. Prospect wants to talk to a reference customer. And I want you to map out in advance what you're gonna ask for in return for all of these things. And if it's a lightweight request from the prospect, what you're gonna map out is gonna be lightweight in return, but it's going to be something that's going to be helpful to you. So as that deal progresses, they get asked, send me a demo recording or fill out this questionnaire. They're going to be great. I can do that, but I'm going to you're going to ask something in return. So you're already getting them to think the way you want them to think and approach the deal that you want them to approach it the right way. It sounds to me like if I was to TLDR this little part here, what I'm hearing is you really get reps to think about how am I going to apply this coaching before I get to the call? And then if you're having them document that, then you have them send you examples, alright, of your next three or four calls where you did this. Show me exactly how you did it. And that seems like a real closed loop system, which I think is really effective. Give you the coaching. You process what you're gonna do with it. Document that what you were gonna do with it. Now show me that you actually did it, and then I'm gonna give you feedback. And then that loop is gonna continue until we feel that you're, like, good at the skill. I think that's a it's an amazing process. Yeah. That's a really good way to summarize it. I do want them to think about it and kind of visualize it before it's actually happening, because then the expectation is clear. There's no excuses if it doesn't happen, and then you can come back and measure it and, reinforce it. One of the things you talked about was coaching right after it happened. Back in the day before you there was no Zoom, there were no virtual meetings. You did everything face to face. I would ride for two to three days with a rep in the field, in their car. We go to Panera Bread. We get coffee. We'd have dinner together. It was an awesome experience. That's all kinda gone away. But one of the beautiful parts of that process was after we would leave the meeting, all we would do driving to the next meeting was talk about what happened in the previous meeting, and that immediacy was fresh in their mind. My feedback was fresh. Like, we could really analyze it way differently than two weeks later or something like when my call review session came up. How do you get a rep though to not get kind of gun shy of, okay, every time I do a meeting, I'm gonna get immediate feedback. Like, how how do you set that up so that it's a very positive thing versus a negative? Yeah. It's a cultural thing. So you want to foster that culture where people understand why they're going to get feedback and you're selling to them the future state. You're not selling to them the negatives you're selling, Kate, Hey, you're doing really well. You're here, but here's how you can get to here. And to do that, I like to give a lot of feedback. I want to listen to your calls. You tell me how you like to receive feedback as well. First of all, it's a cultural thing and there needs to be that expectation and you need to hire for those kinds of people. Sometimes you don't have that luxury when you inherit a team, but one of the main things that will be a deal breaker for me when I'm hiring is, is this person going to be coachable? And I'll ask them questions. What was a recent example of feedback you were given that you implemented that improved your performance? You've set an expectation that you're running a team where there's a lot of feedback. I really like to foster a lot of peer to peer feedback as well. So having not just always me reviewing the calls, but have team members reviewing and commenting on each other's calls, and that can be, super effective as well. Adam, when you talk about coaching immediacy, you talked both about delivering the coaching immediately Yep. But immediate implementation. And that's a concept we haven't talked about as much, which is I think a lot of people are like, okay. Rep gets off the call. You send them the Slack. You send them the email. You jump off the call. Whatever it is. You give them feedback. But getting them to implement it tomorrow when their next sales call is seven days down the road, that's unusual, and that's also hard because I can imagine my rep saying, I I I want to implement this tomorrow. Don't get me wrong. But I don't have time to do a thirty minute role play tomorrow. Can't I just wait for my next actual sales call? So if you're trying to encourage your reps to immediately get the practice reps in right after the coaching, how do you sell your reps on that or suggest that they carve time in their day to get the coaching and to actually apply the coaching? So the immediate feedback is really important. So like Mark said, if you can ride shotgun, whether it's in person or whether it's Zoom now, and give immediate feedback, that's gonna be the most impactful. Or if you can listen to a call recording that you weren't even on, but listen to it an hour after the call happened, that's really powerful, but you can also do some of the adoption then and there. You've set a call with them to review the meeting you were just on. Hey, I thought you could have done this differently. Let's play that back now. And how would you have done it differently and have them just do a mini role play then and there, then you at least know, okay, they understood the feedback. They know how to implement it. And then it might be that, okay, let's now map out when your next call is. Okay. It's two days. We can live with that, and I'm gonna set ten minutes with you after that call to review how you went there as well. That's probably the key way, but sometimes again, there's more than two days before that next call. So I encourage role play and it doesn't need to be thirty minutes. Like I said, it might be with me. I'm like, let's just hop on and I'm going to throw some cold call objections at you. And we're going to just go back and forth for ten minutes. That's all I need from you. Or, hey, why don't you grab Sally? She's really good at handling this objection. Do some role plays with her tomorrow, and then I'll review that with you. Or, I've just come across in the last few weeks these AI role play tools where you can go on. Some of them are free, and Sally can record herself doing a role play in her own time in the next day or so, and send it to me for reviews. It doesn't always have to be the manager, like, coming down and you're watching over your back. But also, it's how you deliver the feedback as well. I'm always focusing on the positive and the future state and not like, you did this wrong, you did this wrong. It's more about how can we get you doing this better and differently. And if you do it that way, in my experience, I haven't got a lot of pushback on the coaching. So, Adam, I think this goes back to what Mark was mentioning earlier, which is, like, having a coaching rhythm is really, really, really important because you've got role plays. You're assigning them to do the question thing. You're having them map out org charts. You have themes by every single rep. I remember it was really helpful for me to have coaching rhythms with my team. For example, Tuesdays, we would tear down prospecting calls or emails. Wednesdays and Thursdays, it was usually pipe reviews and one on ones. And so that was more opportunity for either deal related stuff or is more opportunity for role plays based on what that rep needed. And then Fridays, we would review tapes of the team. So I can imagine that any of these coaching opportunities could land into any one of those sessions. Yep. I'm curious for you. How are you keeping track of all of this stuff? Is it in a rolling one on one doc where you're having reps put together their own idea plan, what have you? How do you make sure that you actually remember all of the stuff that needs to happen with your reps? So the first thing I do is I have a table or or matrix of all the critical skills that someone on my team needs to be successful. And then I'll go through periodically and review that probably once a quarter at the start of the quarter and halfway through the quarter And who's strong, medium, and weak? And it's something that I look at myself. I don't share with the team. And then I know, okay, I've got to work on these three things with Greg, but I'm gonna start with thing number one. Then once we've done that, thing number two and thing number three. So I'll get with Greg. And in our one on one document, we'll have a mini coaching plan. Like this is the theme for the next month. It's going to be multi threading, for example. And, and the one on one, we're going to talk about feedback and then actions. And then, of course, there's going to be Greg sending me several call snippets at the end of each week that I'm going to review and be able to give feedback on. So we've got that in there. I also recommend a standalone coaching session because sometimes it's just a a one on one. You're going through so many other things that coaching gets squeezed at the end. Well, Adam, it's been an amazing show. We have to move to the final question. And now we talked about a lot of good coaching habits, but it's time to talk about a bad one. So what is one bad coaching habit that every sales leader needs to break so that all teams could get a little bit better? I'll use one just while we're talking about coaching tools is what I call comment bombing. I've seen a lot of managers get overexcited with these call recording tools. And rather than listening to a call, taking notes, and then hopping on with the rep and going through the feedback, comment, like two minutes in comment, I didn't like your upfront contract, Four minutes in, comment. And then what the reps got is 12 different comments on 12 different things. And they're receiving that out of context, so it's probably not gonna land the right way. It's probably gonna make them insecure or frustrate them or whatever. And there's not clarity. So it's unlikely they're gonna improve in a lot of those things because there's just too many things to digest. Amazing show. Everyone hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alrighty, folks. It's time for a two by two recap from this episode with Adam Caroll. Mark, what do you have for your two? Number one is make sure that you do immediate feedback. He took me right back to my ride along days back in the the day where I was like, I still remember you come out of the office. You're talking to somebody. You're riffing on what happened. And I think we've lost a lot of that in sales as we go from back to back meetings, Zoom to Zoom meetings, our our managers in one place, we're in another place. And so that immediate feedback, love it. And then the second thing is is if you don't dictate the coaching schedule that you want your managers and reps to have, then you can assume it's not happening probably much at all or very impromptu ad hoc. And I think that he gave a very prescriptive way of organizing coaching with this much time, these many days, all this kind of stuff that really makes you super intentional. Number three. When you are being intentional about your coaching, block out two hours every single week to review calls. You need to tell your reps what theme the call should be in, for example, discovery or negotiation. You need to ask them to give you specific time stamps and then have them self diagnose where they think things went right or wrong. And then lastly, number four, when you are prescribing practice plans, role plays are not the only practice plan you can prescribe. So for example, if someone needs to work on having better impact questions, you might have your rep write down the 15 questions that your team can ask to get impact and the three that they wanna practice next. Or you could have them work on multithreading by have them map out the org chart for their next three opportunities and identify five people that they haven't already gotten in front of them. Alrighty, folks. If you enjoyed this one, then you were probably thinking about your own coaching rhythms. And the legendary KD, Kevin Dorsey, did a write up on our newsletter on how to run a great one on one in sales, and that is probably the most important coaching rhythm that you can have between yourself and a rep. So that is linked in the show notes. It was in our newsletter, and it's one of my personal favorite ones. It's actually what Nick uses to do one on ones with his new rep that he's hired at thirty MPC, Alex Murphy. And, folks, we will catch you on the next episode.
