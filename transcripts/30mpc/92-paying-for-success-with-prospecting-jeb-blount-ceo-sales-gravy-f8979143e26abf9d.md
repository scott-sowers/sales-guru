## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Armond Farrokh. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the legendary, the one and only, Jeb Blunt, the author of Fanatical Prospecting and a ton of other really kick ass books. Nick, why should people listen? Jeb has been a foundational element of my selling career. When I first became an AE, I bought fanatical prospecting. I went to Fogo To Chao, and I literally spent four and a half hours reading the book and eating rib eye steak. And if that doesn't tell you how important Jeb is, I don't know what will. Three, two, one. Eat this episode. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Jeb. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Well, the first one is the more people you talk with, the more you're gonna sell. And this simply means that sales is a human endeavor, and far too many salespeople these days have become asynchronous. So they hide behind email, text, by social media, anything but have a conversation with people. The more people you talk with, the more you're gonna sell. Number two is that success is paid for in advance with prospecting. And, folks, the rent is due every single day. We're gonna talk a little bit more about the thirty day rule, but the thirty day rule simply says that the prospecting that you do in any given thirty day period has a tendency to pay off for you offer you over the next ninety days. So you gotta do it every day, every day, every day. And finally, we'll talk about the ledge. I love the ledge technique. The ledge technique is what neuroscientists call the magic quarter second. It gives you just a moment when you're facing an objection to gather your thoughts, gather your emotions so you know exactly what to say. Boom. The man himself. Alright. We're gonna start on the phones and then work our way backwards to the routines. So, Jeb, you give me a cold call. I slam you with, I'm not interested, or I'm already using something. And immediately, what most reps do is they speed up, and they're like, can I get thirty seconds to tell you why I'm calling? And so what do I do in the moment that I'm hit with one of those dismissive objections to stop the bleeding and properly assess the situation? So when you get an objection, the first thing you gotta understand is that you kick off that objection kick off something called fight or flight. And your in fight or flight is basically your body's response to a threat. And you wouldn't think a a sales objection or a prospecting objection would be a threat, but because of the way that we are built as human beings, we respond to two different types of threats. One would be a physical threat. So you would have the same response, for example, if you were taking a hike in the mountains near LA and, a mountain lion came out on the path in front of you, fight or flight would happen. And by the way, the exact same feeling, that exact same response happens when you're on a prospecting call and someone tells you no. That's called a social threat. Human beings are incredibly sensitive to being rejected, and we are for a reason. It's a kind of a double edged sword. Right? So the sensitivity to being rejected helps you get along with people. It's it allows you to function in society, and it's it's a it's a response to the fact that we work inside of groups, and our greatest fear other than death is to be kicked out of the group. Right? To be to be rejected and pushed aside. So if if you think about it, we're we're facing those two big fears. So when someone tells you no on a prospecting call, your body starting with a little a little structure inside of your brain called the amygdala, senses that someone's rejecting you. You're getting kicked out of the group, my my greatest fear, and I need to run. Right? Or or in some cases, I need to fight, which would be getting an argument with them. And so what you have to do in that moment is you have to disrupt that process and rise above the disruptive emotion of fight or flight and choose your response. During a fight or flight response, all of the blood in your body is running into your muscle skeletal system to get you ready to respond to the threat, and it's a threat. And when that happens, the body, since it only has so much blood to go around, begins to take blood away from nonessential parts of your body. One of those nonessential parts, the oleocortex, because when you're facing a threat, it doesn't pay to think. It pays to get away from the threat. That's why sometimes when you get that objection and you're, you know, you're getting you're going you're you're, like, your brain's going, I know what to say, but your mouth's going because you don't know what to say. So what we use is a simple technique called a ledge. And all the ledge is something that you say every single time you get that response that response that gives you what neuroscientists call the magic quarter second that allows you to rise above the disruptive emotion and choose your response. And trust me on this, you know what to say. It's just hard to find the words when you're consumed by this fight or flight emotion. So for example, if someone says I'm not interested, then your response might be, I figured you'd probably say that. Right? I say that all the time. People say I'm not interested. I say I figured you'd probably say that, or I'm not interested. I say, you know, that's what everybody says. That's a simple ledge. Or if someone says, you know, I'm too busy, I go, well, that's exactly why I called. Or if someone says I'm happy, I go, that's fantastic. And I don't have to think about it. I say those things every single time. And and by the way, deeper into the into the sales conversations, ledges can become questions versus statements. But typically, in a a prospecting objection because it's moving really, really fast, you need it to be a statement. So we begin with a ledge and then a disrupt statement, and then I ask again. And this is important. If you don't ask again, they're gonna go right back to where they were before. You have to ask again. That's the biggest mistake that we make in this framework. So, for example, we were talking earlier in the preshow about, you know, what happens when they say I'm happy because that's what people say. Like, most of the time, they go, look, I'm happy. I'm all good. We got a great vendor. And what works, and, Arman, you've been using this so you know this works, is I'll say something like this. I'll say, that's fantastic. Because they're not expecting you to say that. Right? So they're expecting you to say, well, I understand. But, like, the only two people in the world that say I understand are mamas and salespeople. So now you're just a pattern. Right? So if you're a pattern, it's easy to turn you off. So I say, that's fantastic because they're not expecting me to agree with them. And I don't say that's great because it's not great. Right? And I don't say I'm happy for you because I'm not happy. I just say that's fantastic. Well, you're happy. That's fantastic. And then I move into a really simple frame. That's fantastic. You know, anytime you're getting great rates or great prices and great service, you should never think about changing. Now I'm doing two things in that moment, and you have to recognize that what I'm doing right now is happening fast and it's happening at the subconscious level. Right? So when I say anytime you're getting great rates and great, you know, great service, you should never think about changing. If I say great prices and great service, I'm immediately priming them to think, am I really getting great rates and great service? Now that's, again, happening at the subconscious level, but it's creating a little bit of doubt. If you're getting this, you shouldn't change. Right? That makes sense. So if you're getting great rates and great prices, you shouldn't change. But then I use something that's, that's that that triggers something called reactance. You should never change. Now think about it. Nick, when someone tells you that you shouldn't do something, you should never do something. Right? What do you immediately do? Say I'm gonna do it. I'll do it. Right? Well That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Your inner three year old comes to the surface and you go, I'll show you. So if you tell someone they should never do something, immediately, like, well, wait a minute. And sometimes people will stop you. They go, what do you mean I shouldn't change? I'm like, well, I mean, if you're getting great service and great prices, you said you were happy. Well, I might not be happy. Okay. Well, let's get together. Right? So so I all I'm doing is triggering this little bit of a tug. Right? Am I really getting great service and great prices? And, you know, wait a minute. I could change if I want to. You should never think about changing. And then I go, look. All I want is an opportunity to put a name with a face. Right? So if I'm asking for a video call, name with a face. Right? Or if I'm if I'm, if I'm going there in person, you know, name with a face. Then I said, all I wanna do is put a name of the face and, and learn a little bit more about you. And at a minimum, look, at a minimum, I'll leave you with some competitive pricing that will help you keep, and this is important, the way that you say this, the other guy's honest. I'd never say my competitor. Because when I say competitor, I put them on the same plane as me, the other guys. So at a at a at a minimum, I'll leave you with some competitive rates. We'll keep the other guys honest. Okay. Now I got leverage. Right? Because guess what? Curiosity for human beings powerful. Right? So if you're curious to see my rates, the only way you're gonna get my rates is to meet with me. Right? And and then some salespeople say, well, what I don't wanna leave rates. Like, we don't leave with prices. I'm like, I'm trying to get the meeting. And when you get there, if I interview them, like, I'm doing discovery and there's not a fit, I'm not gonna give them a proposal. If there's a fit, I'm gonna give them competitive prices. So at a minimum, I'll leave you with competitive prices. It'll help to keep the other guys honest. And people say yes to that because, guess what? Everybody wants to make sure that they're not getting screwed over by the vendor that they say they're happy with. And here's what's most important. Everybody says they're happy. They all say they're happy because that's a reflex response. I mean, if if you just only sold to people who are unhappy, you're gonna go broke. They're all happy. Just assume that the entire world is happy. Your job is to make them unhappy. Right? So we get this. We understand that rejection, right, is is a threat to human beings, a social threat, because our greatest fear other than death is getting kicked out of the group. Make sense? The thing is is it serves us well when we're dealing with other human beings because it allows us to know where the line is drawn, which is why it's natural for us to be averse to being rejected. However, in sales, right, your job is to go out and find rejection and bring it home. So what you need is a mechanism or a a, you know, a a a framework that will allow you to get past that rejection. And and just, I I think you said Plugfest earlier. So just as a plug, I wrote an entire book about this called Objections that is, has been a mega bestseller all over the world. And it and it it's real. Like, it just like, I'll just tell you the truth. The the truth is this is how you're gonna feel. This is the this is what's gonna happen. And I walk you through the different objections that you get all throughout the sales process all the way to closing the deal and the different ways that you can manage those. But this ledge process of gathering control of your emotions because basically in every conversation, the human being that has the most control of their emotions is the one most likely to get their desired outcome, in this case, getting the meeting. But if you can control your emotions, then you can control your response. And if you can control your response, you're gonna be in control of the conversation, and you're going to win or get the outcome that you desire. Hey, Jeb. One situation that's related to objections where I feel like there's a mountain lion staring me down on a hike is when I'm dealing with what some folks might call a gatekeeper. So I'm calling Arman Farrokh, and I think I have his direct dial. But then somebody else picks up and they say, Arman Farrokh's office. That's one of the biggest situations where I'm like, I I don't really know what to say. One of the things I learned from you is I say, hey. Could you please connect me with Arman Farrokh, please? And I do the double please. But when I get hit with the, what is this regarding, I have no idea what to say. So what do what do you typically say? So I'll say, we work with a bunch of other law firms in Atlanta who are looking to improve their attorney timekeeper experience, and I was hoping to have a conversation with him about how we could potentially help. And then 99% of the time, I get hit with a, yeah. We're not interested. And then I'll hang up the phone, and I'll say, alright. Well, I better find a different phone number. Call after hours or find a different way to reach this person because I'm never gonna get past that gatekeeper. So you have run into a $10 an hour person who is making a decision for a multimillion dollar law firm. So if that person, whether it's true or not, thinks that you're a threat to them, they're unlikely to let you through. They also if they don't feel like it's in their boss's best interest for them to talk to you, they're gonna say I'm not interested. So first of all, you wanna think about what your messaging is. So if you say a bunch of law firms, does that sound exactly confident? Not really. A bunch of law firms. Right? A plethora of law firms. A gaggle of law firms. Right? A gaggle. A gaggle of law firms. So one thing that you could do is use a specific reference. So we work with Blunt Monastore and Taylor, over on Peachtree Street, And we've been helping them improve their billing through improving the way that the attorneys log time, which has increased their, you know, billing by 20%. And, and they said that we should probably talk to you. So I'm I'm using a specific reference, social proof. Right? Someone else who's doing it, and I'm using that. And if you have that like, if you don't have that reference, then you can't use it. Right? Wouldn't be fair. But if you have that reference, we're helping blah blah blah blah blah, and it's really working well for them, and they said that we should probably talk to you. Well, the specificity is really powerful there because I think by saying, oh, a bunch of law firms, a gaggle of law firms that more equals better, but the other human being isn't able to actually visualize what that means. Like, what the heck is a bunch of law firms versus, like, you're seeing the name of the law firm, you're seeing the street address of where they are. Like, it's actually something that when you're storytelling or or telling a lie to somebody, the more details you insert, the more believable it is. Sometimes I like to trick Armand and tell him a ridiculous story, and I insert all these crazy details about the color of the shirt I was wearing and the fajitas I ate I ate earlier in the day. And he believes it because there's so many specific details. You got something, Armand? Yeah. Jeb, I was gonna ask about this because so I take a similar approach to what you guys are talking about where it'll be like, hey. We work with a couple other Andreessen portfolio companies. Right? So the specific investor, they're an Andreessen portfolio company as well. But then say nothing about what the product does or the problem that you will solve. Right? So only social proof. And I'll be like, hey. I sent Jeb a note the other day. I let him know I'd I'd be giving him a ring. Right? And so it's only social proof, and then, hey. He he should know I'm calling. Am I setting myself up for a pissed off partner of a law firm, or is it okay to exclude the actual problem or the the solution that you potentially have? If it works. Like, if you if you just said, we work with this and and we've helped them do this or we work with this and there's some trends that are gonna be impacting your boss coming up, and I thought you should know about those issues, then nothing wrong with that. I mean, there's nothing wrong with saying thing as long as you're not lying to the gatekeeper. Mhmm. Like, if you're lying to the gatekeeper, you're you're dead in the water. Don't trick the gatekeeper. Don't do anything that's other than absolute professional. Be as transparent as possible. Yeah. And and and absolute professional. Be as transparent as possible. Yeah. And and if you have real value for the law partner, then explain what that value is. So when you say a couple of other or a bunch of others, it didn't really work. But if you said, we work with law firms that are in your sector to help them with this, this, and this. I sent, you know, lawyer blunt. I sent Jeb a email letting them know that I was gonna be calling because I have a few trends that he's gonna need to know about that are gonna be impacting what billing looks going down the road. Or I I sent him some information around how we're able to help increase billing without putting any more time on his schedule. Like, you can do that. Now so I'm gonna tell I want I wanna be as direct as possible about the value that I add because all the gatekeeper is doing is making a decision about whether or not they should put you on the calendar. Now what my gatekeepers will do is if it sounds stupid, you're never talking to me, and I'm never gonna know about it. Right? If it sounds good, then you'll you'll end up on my schedule somehow or another. Right? And, and if it if it sounds kinda maybe we need to talk to Jeff because I don't wanna be the person that didn't bring this to him, then they may say, give me your information and let me go check with him. And that's fair. Right? Now, in some situations, let's say that Nick, you've called this lawyer over and over and over again. And let's say you've talked to the gatekeeper three or four times, and the gatekeeper is not letting you through. One tactic that you can use is so you can do this. You could say to Arm let's say Armand's a gatekeeper. I would say, Armand, look, I know that your boss's time is really valuable, and my job is to help your boss. And I'm helping lots of law firms around Atlanta improve their billing. And in fact, on average, they're increasing billing by 20%. This is a lot of money. It's dropping straight to the bottom line, which means that they can provide better benefits. They can do more. And listen. I know that you're the person that is gonna make the decision about whether or not I'm gonna get to your boss. Would it be okay if I schedule a meeting with you so I could present my solution and you can make the decision whether or not it makes sense to get me in front of your boss? And you'll be surprised at how many gatekeepers will go, okay. Because suddenly what you've done is you've you've acknowledged their power and you showed them respect. And it works. Now if you're dealing with a receptionist, the receptionist's job is to give you information. When is Arman gonna be in? Like, when is when when should I call here? What should I do there? What are y'all using right now for billing? Like, I'm I'd grill I'd grill if I gotta go back, I'll grill them again, grill them again, grill them again, grill them again. But I'm gonna keep doing that. So that and I'll go there. Now another thing that you can do, obviously, you got the direct dial. If you if you called the assistant, you got direct dial. You think you got direct dial, but you're dialing dialing the wrong time of the day. You're dialing the the the, you know, the the lawyer, say, at, you know, 11:00 in the morning. Well, trust me. My I came from a my my family is a is a basically a law firm. And, in 11:00 in the morning, they're in depositions, they're in court. Right? They're having lunch with clients. They're not sitting around in their offices. And if they are in their offices, they're billing people. Right? So same thing with calling doctors. Right? You call doctors in the middle of the day, they only get paid when they're billing. Lawyers only get paid when they're billing. So when do you call? You wanna call early, early in the morning. A lot of lawyers get in super early. You wanna call late in the afternoon when they're wrapping up. You wanna call on Friday afternoons. And here's a weird crazy tip, call them on Saturday mornings. Because a lot of attorneys are in their offices on Saturday mornings because lawyers are that's a tough job. And by the way, this is just essentially calling lawyers. Most lawyers don't really like what they do. Like, they're not happy people. And because of all the demands for the job and I'm probably gonna get hate mail for this, but it's the truth. And, again, I've I've got firsthand experience because I am my my family literally is a law firm. Right? So, so if you if you think that way, then when are they gonna be in the office? Saturday mornings are a great place. And this, by the way, is true for small businesses, for any type of professionals that you're calling. It's a great time to call. And, and then finally, right, if if nothing else, what you do with the with the gatekeeper is you say when you say I'll meet with you, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna have DoorDash bring by coffee. I'm a have DoorDash bring you lunch. So meet me at lunch. I'll pay for lunch, and then I'll show you what we do, and you can make the decision from there whether or not I'm gonna move on to the boss. Now, obviously, you would do that with great opportunities, the best opportunities. So and all those things work. And there's no, like, I don't have a magic pill for getting past gatekeepers. I can just tell you this. If you're vague, if you don't sound secure, if you don't sound confident, if you get in fights with them, if you lie to them, your life is gonna be a whole lot harder than dealing with them, treating them like human beings, and then using gatekeepers for the most important thing, which is gathering information so that you make your, you know, your database and your information about that particular prospect better. So in the long term, you're starting to use those signals to get in. So, Jeb, we've gone through all of these objections. And in one of the objections, you talked about getting around it entirely by calling in the morning, calling in the afternoons, calling in a Saturday morning. Those are a lot of different times. So can you give me a sense? A lot of times I hear from reps, I don't have time to prospect. So how do I make sure if I'm the most successful rep in the world taking 10 calls per day, how do I make sure that I always get my prospecting in my daily rhythm? You start first thing in the morning. Like, you start by eating the frog first thing in the morning. We talk about prospecting. Nobody likes prospecting. Prospecting is awful. It's a grind. Prospecting is the price that you have to pay in advance for success in sales, and it's not something that's like a quid pro quo. It's not like I call Nick and I get meetings. Right? Sometimes I'm calling Nick, I get the gatekeeper, I have a conversation with the gatekeeper, and the gatekeeper goes and talks to to her boss, and I send another email behind that, and I connect on LinkedIn. And thirty days later, they reengage and say, hey. We wanna talk about this. This is called the thirty day rule. Right? The thirty day rule simply says that the prospecting that you do in any given thirty day period has a tendency to pay off for you over the next ninety days. So a lot of salespeople, they say I don't have time for prospecting. And what they're really saying is I did it once and it didn't work. Right? Versus I do it every day. Every day, every day, every day, every day. Not prospecting day, prospecting every single day. Right? So if you said, if I said, do you have fifteen minutes? Nick, you would say, yeah. I got fifteen minutes. And, Armis, you you say I have fifteen minutes. I said, great. You have fifteen minutes. Okay. Well, do you have thirty minutes? Yeah. I have thirty minutes. Okay. Great. Super. You have an hour. Yep. Because pretty much every rep has an hour a day that they can they can spend on prospecting. Great. Front load your day with frog eating. Front load your day with prospecting. Do it first thing in the morning. Like, start off and just run a call block. It'll change your life. And this is what I mean by daily battle rhythm. So every single day you got a routine. Look at any salespeople anywhere in the world, anywhere. Go anywhere. You look at the top salespeople, they have a routine, and they run that routine every single day because they are elite athletes. Go look at any elite athlete. Pick any league, anywhere, anyhow. And by the way, the way you invest your time is the greatest predictor in the world of whether you're gonna be successful. And the thing about salespeople is when I say this, like, you have a choice because when you tell me you don't have time, I always tell people in the moment. I'm like, you're not gonna like my answer because because I don't buy that. Right? You're the one that made that choice. You have choices, and and you gotta make a choice. You gotta make a choice whether you're gonna be fanatical about prospecting, whether you're gonna keep the pipeline full because the pipe is life and it's everything. Right? You're gonna make that choice or not. Well, Jeb, you said it in the beginning. It's like success in sales happens when you talk to more and more and more people. And something that I always have to remind myself is, like, I tell myself success in sales is measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations that I'm willing to have. Uncomfortable conversations come not only in prospecting, but when you're working a deal. Like, maybe there's something that you can't do and the customer thought, and you've gotta have sort of a awkward conversation. Like, your job is to go find that resistance and rejection and hard work. And Armand knows I'm a I love routine, especially when it comes to sales because there's so much chaos in the day of a salesperson. Something goes wrong with an order or a customer, or you get pulled into a last minute training, or your computer crashes, or you're traveling and things go awry. You can control the beginning and the ends of your day. And when you control those pieces of your routine, you're able to weather the chaos. Alright, Jab. We are running out of time here, and this has been a phenomenal episode. Thank you for joining us. We gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We talked about a lot of things salespeople should be doing, but I wanna flip that on its head and ask you the final question, which is what is one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that they need to stop doing because it hurts them more than it helps? They pitch versus listen, and this is really simple. In sales, all you gotta do is think about this. A question you ask is more important than anything that you will ever say, and anything that you say is more impactful and more provocative when you deliver it in the form of a question. Stop pitching. Start listening. Beautiful. Jeb, is there anything else that you wanna promote before we jump off here? Yeah. We talked about the Fanatical Prospecting book. We built a book club guide. It's a 31 page book club guide that allows you to, like, run twelve week book clubs. So if you got a team of people, you can grab this guide for free. And if you're an individual reading it, it's, like, gives you reflection points and questions you should ask, and it's got even places for sort of like a workbook. It's absolutely free, and you can get it at salesgravy.com/resources. Salesgravy.com/resources. There's no strings attached. We just want people to enjoy the book club so you can roll through the book club guide. Beautiful. Jeb, we really appreciate you joining us on the show, and everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Jeb Blunt include number one, eat the frog. Your first thing in the morning is prospecting. Just get it out of the way. Number two, the ledge. When someone gives you an objection, they're pushing you away. They're expecting you to come right back. But if you can instead just pattern break and agree with them. If they give you competitors, say, oh, yeah. I'm not surprised. They're awesome. They're a great group. You pull the chair out from underneath them, and you pattern break, which brings us to number three. When you run into that competitor after you pattern break, you can say, hey. If nothing else, we'll leave you with a quote to keep the other guys honest. And then lastly, number four, when you're leading with context, especially when calling gatekeepers, do not just say, hey. We work with a bunch of other companies or we work with a bunch of other law firms. Instead, you can say, hey. We work with a few other Chicago law firms like x, y, and z, and you're also a Chicago law firm. Alrighty, Nick. Those are our four. How could people help us out? So I've read all of Jeb's book, and it was still tremendously helpful for me to have a live conversation with him because I was able to workshop stuff. And occasionally, I get messages from folks who say, hey. I wanna ask questions of you, Nick. I love the the asynchronous podcast, but I want to engage with you and Arman in real time. And that opportunity has come. We have launched thirty minutes to Presidents Club live, and you can get information about when thirty minutes to Presidents Club live is going on by following the link in the show notes to subscribe to our newsletter. We'll send you an email every now and then to let you know when thirty MPC live is dropping. That's all I got. We'll catch you next week, folks.
