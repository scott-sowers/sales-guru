## Transcript

Good morning, everybody. And welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's Club. My name is Arman Frogg. I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have Jeff Bojorek. He's the man who oversees all of Parabola Consulting, is a podcast host, a salesman, and a LinkedIn personality. Nick, why should people listen? We have a great episode talking about discovery questions and asking questions that you and the customer don't know the answer to and why that's really powerful. Three, two, one. The power. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to talk. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Alright, Jeff. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. This first one might seem a little counterintuitive, but I'm gonna tell reps to stop and think. You need to have a good idea of what you want to accomplish before you start to try to accomplish anything. And I think so many reps are engaged and ingrained in this hustle, hustle, hustle kinda mindset that they act without thinking about what they're trying to do, and you do a lot of stuff that you don't need to be doing that doesn't help you accomplish what the goal is. Set yourself up for success, identify what you're trying to accomplish, then go do it. Beautiful. What's number two, Jeff? I think we have a bravery problem in the sales profession, and I think that there are a lot of sales pros that are not brave enough to do good discovery. I've got three levels of discovery that I'm really kind of thinking through and talking about. Three levels of discovery questions. One, you gotta ask questions that they don't know the answers to, which is a little bit counterintuitive. Secondly, you gotta ask questions that you don't know the answers to, which are based on the answers they give you from level one. And then level three is ask questions that you that neither one of you actually knows the answers to. This is where great conversations really take off and when you can start to see the future with your prospect, that's very, very important, particularly in long sales cycles. Alright. Alright. We're gonna have to spend some time on that. But first, round us out. What's number three, Jeff? Talk to your peers. This is something that I think some reps do really well and others don't even think about it. And particularly now as we're working remotely and all we have is our phones, we don't have those water coolers to bump into each other with. Identify what other top performers in your company are doing and see not only what they're doing, but see why it's working for them and try to integrate some of those best practices into your own selling practices. Right? I used to spend a lot of time behind my windshield, and I always had another rep, four or five of them actually on speed dial, and we would spend those hours together challenging each other, making each other better. I love it. Especially that last one, Jeff. I mean, a lot of times, folks will just see the numbers go up, and the answer is like, I better make more cold calls. But this happened and it's always more. Right? You can always get redder in the face. I I had this one SDR who was, he was really struggling, but he was putting up all the numbers. And I was like, hey. Take the top guy. Go look at the last 10 ops he booked and follow him all the way back to the first cold outreach. And what he realized is he was working crap accounts, and his outreach was junk. And so it didn't matter at all how long or how many more dials he did because he was doing it the wrong way in the first place, which was your first point too. Can we talk about crap accounts just for a second? I don't know. Let's say you got $2,000,000 to do this year. K? You can open 10 new accounts that are worth $200,000 a year, or you can open a 100 new accounts worth $20,000 a year. Right? I think the math works on that. How much extra effort in the sales process does it take to win a quarter of $1,000,000 of account versus a $25,000 account? It's not a whole lot more. You have 10 times more revenue. Maybe it's 25% more work. Maybe you gotta be a little tighter. Maybe you gotta be a little sharper. Maybe you gotta have your i's dotted, your t's crossed. But for crying out loud, if you just have your act together, if you're prepared, if you're just ready to go in and make a sale, why wouldn't you call on the one with the biggest bang on you know, the biggest return on your investment of time, effort, and resources? You're setting your sights too small. Aim higher, shoot bigger, dream bigger, and and go get it. Armand, I feel like that situation you just described, like, literally described my first ever year of being an SDR where I was at the top of the leaderboard every single week. Like, I really prided myself, and I made more calls than anybody else. And I wasn't, like, booking meetings. I wasn't getting deals because, like, I was just calling random accounts that I found in Salesforce. And so, Jeff, I guess my question for you is I I want you to talk a little bit about I think you have this model around I think you call it your, like, two by two model around targeting people to prospect. So I've spent a lot of time working with a couple of clients in particular on with, Stephen Covey and Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. Great book. Like, it's not necessarily a sales book, but everything you need to know to be good at selling is in that book. So go check it out. He talks about the Eisenhower quadrant, right? This matrix of urgency versus importance and where you need to spend your time. The vertical axis is growability. The horizontal axis is accessibility. So highly accessible on the left, not so accessible on the right, highly growable on the top, not so growable on the bottom. So quadrant one is growable and accessible. Okay? Quadrant two, very growable, right, but not very accessible. Quadrant three, not growable, but very accessible. Quadrant four, not growable, not accessible. We don't need to worry about them. Right? So quadrants one, two, and three are really all we're worried about. In quadrant one, you've got people you are access you have access to and are highly growable. Go get them. Go get them. This is what you spend your prospecting time doing is gaining access to accounts and facilities, customers that you can grow with. Okay? So it's very important if this is if you have any clients, any prospects in this quadrant, you gotta go get them. And these could be existing customers that just have new lines of business that you can open with them, or these are prospects who have given you access to them. But spend your time there first. Spend your time there. Spend the most of your time there. Quadrant two, now these are those targets. Right? They're not even prospects yet, but these are targets. You don't have access to them, but you know that's where your growth is coming from. When you get out of that urgent spot where it's like, hey. Here's someone ready to move forward and maybe close business. After you spend that time, you've gotta go spend your time in quadrant two. The problem most AEs have, most full line, full cycle reps, however you wanna call this, they spend a lot of their time in quadrant three. These are accounts that are very accessible, but not very growable. And that's problematic. Right? You go there because this game is hard. Selling is tough. You get your face kicked in, on a regular basis, and you wanna go someplace where they're gonna give you a hug, slap you on the back, and maybe buy you a drink when you get there. Right? But your job is not to go have drinks with your customers. Your job is to grow your business. So by definition, the warm, safe, cozy space of very accessible but not very growable, that is what attracts and traps so many sellers, but you have to be straight with yourself, and you have to realize that that's not where your growth is coming from. And I know there are people listening right now saying, well, wait a second, Pajorek. What if I leave those people alone and I lose revenue? You can't move backwards and try to grow. Well, no. You can't. But you have to be really straight with yourself about how likely it is that they're gonna go somewhere and what it really takes to keep their business because it doesn't take as much to keep their business as it does to get the new stuff. So I'm as a big a fan as anybody at growing within existing accounts. Listen. If someone gives me $20, I don't care if I knew them or not. I know how to spend $20. So this gotta be net new versus get out of babysitting your accounts. Babysit the accounts if you can triple them this year, but it's it's not about new versus old. It's about growable versus not, and you have to be very honest with yourself about whether or not where you're spending your time is going to help you grow. Let's talk about this a little bit because I've had a lot of people message me and be like, Nick, we I want you I want you guys to talk about, like, account management when you actually have accounts you have to manage. Sure. Can you talk a little bit about so I've got an account that's accessible, but it's not super growable. And I don't wanna completely and utterly ignore them. But at the same time, you've just shared I should be spending my time on other opportunities where I have more chance of booking more revenue. So what's the cadence that you're keeping in touch with those customers who are already accounts, not a huge chance of growing them, and you just wanna sort of keep it on autopilot? Well, I don't like the word autopilot, Nick. Okay. Good. Let's ditch that word then. I I don't like the word autopilot because it suggests that you can set it and forget it. Mhmm. The reason you have a cadence that you don't wanna automate is because your account deserves to get that attention from you. So I I think the cadence will determine itself, and it could be different for different accounts. Some people just wanna hear from you every once in a while. They're gonna order whether they need you or not. They don't need customer service. They're really happy. They just place an order every six weeks, and you cash the commission check, and it's great. You wanna make sure that you haven't forgotten about them because people, you know, have that relationship. Other people need to be paid a little bit closer attention to. So know your customers well enough to know how much TLC they need. But you can also leave that in up to them. You leave that meeting. Hey. Everything's going well here. Hey. What does it make sense for us to do? How often should we do this? Do you have anything else you're working on? The good thing about quadrant three is that that's where your referrals come from. So whatever your preferred ratio is. But if you've got the lion's share of that of their wallet, there's a reason for that, and they have friends. So you wanna make sure that you're mining for other opportunities respectfully, politely, but giving them the service they need. You know, if you're actively engaged in your territory, those I think those cadences kind of, reveal themselves. So I think one of the things that's tough is, you know, I've got all these accounts where either prospects, I know they're hot, they're willing to talk to me, or they're existing customers, and I know I could upsell them easily for that $5.10 k. But then I've got this bucket of people who have probably told me to f off a couple times in the last few months. But some of those might be 6 figure contracts waiting in there. And so from the same lens that you have, if there's a big opportunity that's largely growable, but they're very much not accessible, how do you coach people to actually turn those folks into the first quadrant of accessible and growable? Those types of accounts typically fall under your dream client. You'd call those your dream clients. And those are people who you know as your accounts, where you know that you can solve their problem. You know that you've got some differentiators against the competition where they're doing business with right now, and you know that you can help them create outcomes that no one else can. Right? You have a responsibility to them and yourself to keep calling on them. I don't care if they told you to f off. Have they really told you to f off, or have they just said they're not interested right now? Right? Sometimes I think that a passionate no is actually a buying signal. Right? If they have to exert extra extra energy to tell you no, then that means that they went out of their way in some way, and that typically means there's an emotional response there that is often worth digging into. Right? One of my favorite buying signals, it's really counterintuitive, is you cost too much. Like, oh, so you're saying if I was less, you'd be interested, which means that you're interested, but you just don't understand why it's more expensive. Well, that kinda sounds like you're inviting me to justify my price difference. I like that. Please put me in that situation because I'm really good at that. Okay? But these are people that you put on a different cadence. You put on a drip campaign. When there's someone who's worth like, we're talking career making deals here. Right? They're worth continuing to let them it's worth continuing to let them know that you're thinking to them, that you know that you have a solution to their problem, and maybe they're not ready for you right now. But I saw this. I thought of you. I thought you might relate to it. Here you go. But there's always more to explore. You said something earlier that I I kinda wanna get your your take on how you handle this. Sure. You reach out to a prospect. They say you're too expensive. Mhmm. And you say you like when you get put in that situation. Well, I don't have a relationship with this person yet. How are you responding so you get an opportunity to justify the price differential? I actually heard that earlier today. I heard someone say, wow. You're you're a little that's the high end. And I looked him right. I said nothing. I looked him right in the eye. You can't hear this on the podcast, but I essentially raised my eyebrows and almost shrugged my shoulders at him because, like, yeah. I know. It's not my job to reduce my price to the level of your expectations. It's my job to deliver on the value on the price. So I'm not afraid of that. If you're not afraid of that, let's get together, and let's get to work. I was told early on in this new gig that I had. This was several years ago. I was told early on that I was trying to sell Cadillacs in a in a Chevrolet market. And what I knew was that the objection was on price, but there wasn't a value created that would justify that price. And so I knew I had work to do. And that person ended up eventually buying from me. Given the complexity of the sale, I had to get the buy in from somebody else who then understood it and then took me essentially acted as a champion and said, no. I wanna use this product for this surgery, and I know it's more expensive, but in this case, it's very much worth it. They just don't see the value. The the price objection means I haven't done my job. That's okay because now I know where I need to focus my efforts. I got their attention. I actually, had a conversation and discussion with them, and they told me what their biggest issue was. And they just said, well, we don't know that we're gonna see the value in that. And I said, okay. That's fine. We'll just keep having this conversation. I've got you on a drip campaign. We're we're gonna make sure that you know where I am when the situation arises, that your current solution doesn't meet your needs. And at that point, the situation will have changed. So I just there's something about the transparency that comes along when someone tells you you just cost too much. Like, oh, okay. Well, there's a couple ways we can fix that. From a financial aspect, there are a lot of ways that you can manipulate that. Right? I could lower my price. Here's the thing. If I lower my price, I'm losing. Discount's a four letter word in my house. If if I'm in a discount, they're gonna give something too. We're gonna call it a negotiation. It's just what it is. We're gonna meet in the middle somewhere with something that's a little bit more amenable. I understand that. Sometimes the price just, it doesn't make sense. And in that case, I may take my ball and walk away and just realize that this isn't the right time or this isn't the right opportunity or they just don't see the value. Price is a lever that I can play with, but I also knew in this particular situation where the guy told me that I was selling a Cadillac in a Chevrolet market. I also knew that my company wasn't interested in in discounting and that my job was not to try to go haggle with my manager for a better deal, but to say, no. Here's the reason why we cost more. Here's the value of this differentiator. We were perceived as a commodity where we weren't. So I had a different story to tell. I needed to have I needed to go back to the drawing board, figure out the big highlight differentiation points in the story I was telling between the story he was already buying, and make sure that those points landed in a poignant enough way to where he would start to value them. Right? Price is a lever. It's one of the last ones I'm ever willing to move. So, Jeff, I wanna go after you've identified some of those big accounts, and maybe you've gotten past the too expensive objection. So you're working your tier twos. And in that first conversation, you know there's big opportunity, but especially the ones who are not accessible. Usually, in that first conversation, you you gotta deliver some sort of value in those first ten minutes. And it's usually by asking really tough disco questions. And so you talked about the three levels of disco questions. As a rep, how do I start to ask questions that you don't know the answer to or I don't know the answer to without sounding like a complete jerk the whole way through. Stump the chump. Right? It's typically by introducing something that the prospect is not aware of. And when I go to my differentiation points, let's say that I've got three primary ways that I differentiate from the 800 pound gorilla behemoth in the marketplace. Right? Let's assume they're doing business with x, and I'm selling for y. These are my three major differentiation points. And with the the, the market research that most companies provide to reps with and with the knowledge that you can, you know, ascertain by just doing a little bit of research and discovery around the market, you get a pretty good idea for what these people are are using. You get a pretty good idea for what they're struggling with. If you have solutions to those problems, particularly that are tied to your differentiators, I think you start asking questions that lead to conversations about the differentiators. So if I've got differentiation point one, two, and three, and I can think of three questions that would start a conversation about why my difference is important or valuable, that gives me nine questions to ask right there that I can ask without even getting an answer that will make my prospects start thinking differently. The thing is, by the time you've asked the fourth or fifth different question that relates back to this topic, they know you're not going away. They know you're smart enough to do this because nobody no. There aren't very many reps that are doing it this way. So you're you're bringing something to the table. You're bringing new data to the table. You're bringing your own expertise to the table. They're gonna talk to you at some point. Prospecting is about demonstrating you're someone worth talking to with something worth talking about. And you have to sometimes do a lot of work to make sure that, you can get that point across without actually having that conversation. But just because they didn't return your voice mail doesn't mean they didn't get it. Just because they didn't respond to your email doesn't mean they didn't get it. And, a friend of mine, Mike Weinberg, likes to say, you're having a conversation. You're building a relationship with someone even though they haven't responded yet. So you can't give up too early because you are being waited out. I want you to take this in the direction of you talked about three questions. Right? They don't know the answer. You don't know the answer. What the heck is a question that you both don't know the answer to, and why on earth would you ask it? Because that's where partnership happens. So you wanna ask questions that your prospect doesn't know the answer to because it helps you to demonstrate your own expertise and create a little bit of tension. That's very, very important. You are demonstrating that you know something that they don't know. They'd probably be better off for knowing, and you're someone worth talking to with something worth talking about. Based on how they answer those questions and the conversation that starts, if you're paying attention, you will probably find some place where you need to probe a little deeper or they say something that you don't quite understand. You're like, woah. Hold on. Wait. Tell me more about that. A lot of salespeople really pass on this because, well, this discovery meeting was scheduled for thirty minutes. We've only got three minutes left. I better move this for a closing kinda closing question or something. It's like, well, again, like, what's your hurry? Can we just continue this discussion tomorrow or in a couple of days? Like, I really like where this is at. If you're doing your discovery well, your prospect is as engaged or more than you are. So they're happy to continue it again. Your odds of closure increase, like, astronomically when you can get another discovery meeting and actually work together on something even if it takes a few extra days. I don't know. Some people have really, really tight sales cycles, and that's a metric that they're they're measured on, and they need to be really quick with it. For me, if this is gonna be a customer for life, I don't care if I close on Monday or Friday. It's really gonna be okay. But I increase my odds when I have their engagement. So when you built on the questions you ask in level one and you go into these questions where you're demonstrating your own curiosity, you really want them to be engaged, you're really trying to learn more about their situation, Now you get to daydream together. And that that question there aren't very many questions that you don't or that you both don't know the answer to, but they they feel a lot like, what would happen if we took your strengths and our strengths and we put them together? They're figuratively, like, wrapping your arm around their shoulder, and you're kinda looking off into the horizon thinking like, wow. This could be really cool. And then all of a sudden, you're both excited. So, oh, oh my gosh. What what are the possibilities? We could do this. We could do this. We could do this. Oh, that could turn into this. For a long year around the campfire solving all the world's problems. Right? That level three, that that high level of discovery is something that most reps don't even think about approaching. They don't even know what to do when they get there, and they're so concerned with, again, acting before they think about what they need to do. They don't even give themselves the opportunity to pursue it. The best conversations I've ever had with prospects are when you're in that daydreaming phase. You both get those dopamine rushes, and you're really interested in doing something to move forward. And that's where the partnership starts. That's why I I ask those questions. I feel like I get into the situation so much with customers where it takes a little while and then it's the first meeting with a customer. You know, you set a thirty minute discovery meeting to have the conversation start to rev up. And I often find, like, I get twenty three minutes into the conversation, and this is where I'm learning all of the really good stuff, and they're, like, feeding off of me also. And then I'm like, oh, okay. Like, I promise we'd stop five minutes early. It's time to talk about next steps when, like, we still need some more time in that first step. And the impatient part of me is like, okay. Well, now it's time for the demo next week. Let's find a time where I'm probably better served. Like, I like how you framed it. You're like, hey. Like, I think we have more to talk about here. Do you wanna talk can we talk again in a couple days? And, like, listeners, go back and listen to that again because I'm like, I'm gonna set twice as many discovery meetings now, although with the same customers again and again and again. Alright, Jeff. So this was a great episode. Final question for you here. What's one belief that most sales professionals have about the world of selling that you think is totally wrong and needs to be mixed? That there's a way to do anything. There are lots of ways to do everything. There are way more right ways to do it than there are wrong ways to do it. Here's my advice. Do the work. Everybody's trying to find a way to how do I do this faster? Oh, I don't wanna do that. There's gotta be a hack. There's gotta be a way to do it better. There's gotta be an app for that. There's gotta be someone I can delegate this to. I've learned this myself, particularly recently. I get frustrated with new stuff I have to learn or new tools I have to use, and now I gotta change software, whatever. It's like, do the work, man. And what's funny is when I just put my head down and get to work, stuff falls into place. So stop tricking yourself into believing that there's a better way to do it so I shouldn't do it the way I know how to do it, and just get to work. Beautiful. Thanks, Jeff. Anything you wanna plug before we hop off here? Yeah. I'm I'm doing a cool thing. I'm doing some cool stuff. I'm building a community on a website at rethinkthewayyousell.com. It's on a Mighty Networks platform, and I've got some paid premium stuff that's in there and then a paid podcast that's subscription only and everything. But there's a free community there that's really starting to grow, and, it's really fun because other people other than me are starting to contribute too. So it's and we're really trying to build something because most of the bigger social networks, they're really about grabbing attention and promoting things, and there's all the room in the world for that. I use it for that too as well as to create a ruckus every once in a while. But I I think the bigger platforms have are they're starting to lose the ability for people to really connect and learn from each other. So that's why I did that. So it's free. Join it. If if you wanna pursue some of the premium stuff, yeah, we can talk about that too. But I wanna create a safe space for people to connect and grow from each other. Alright, everybody. Stick around. Connect with Jeff. Cause a ruckus. And here's our month sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Jeff Bojorg include, number one, you got a two by two quadrant. You got things that are accessible, and you got deals that are growable. Obviously, you wanna work your accessible and growable deals, but stop working the low hanging fruit of your easily accessible but not really growable accounts and trying to morsel your way two k at a time. Go break in to your highly growable, non accessible accounts. Number two, you're too expensive is a phenomenal objection because what it implies is that if there was a lower price, they would buy. And so just ask them that question to make sure that price is the Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Only thing that's stopping them from moving forward. Number three, find your three major differentiators either in isolation or against a competitor and ask questions that lead your prospect to that space. And then number four, ask the questions that you don't, they don't, or both of you don't know the answers to and get on the same side. Nick, how can people help us out today? Well, this was a super fun one about discovery, and I am all aboard the discovery train, Armand. So I want to tell our listeners about some of our other discovery themed episodes. Number one, Joe Caprio, ditch the chitchat at the beginning of your calls and why that can lead to better discovery. And then number seven was one of my personal favorites because it's mostly Keenan just screaming at Armand about you gotta do discovery better. But that's a really good good one about, supercharging your discovery skills. So those are some of our earlier episodes. If you haven't listened to those, go back. Number one, Joe Caprio. Number seven, Keenan. Thanks Thanks for listening. We'll catch you all next week.
