## Transcript

Good morning, everybody. And welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Armanfro. I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. And today, we have the one and only Charley Johnson. She hosts the sales development sound bites. I don't even think it's a podcast, but she posts all these badass video clips online. And then also she's an SDR at SalesLoft. Nick, why should people listen? Well, if you've been sending emails that say, Armond, I noticed that, or you've been filming videos that start with thank you so much for watching my video. I really appreciate you opening my video. You probably need to listen to this one because you shouldn't be doing that stuff. Three, two, one. Thank you so much for listening to this episode. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Tension, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Charlie. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Yeah. So firstly, creating a hypothesis from your research. So things like looking at the function section on LinkedIn or the hiring page to help us inform what their business goals and challenges are. Beautiful. What's number two? Execution. My favorite topic, video. So how can we do things in our video to stand out in our buyers inbox? So things like sharing our screen on our prospects' LinkedIn page, their careers page, or news articles and things like that. Very nice. Round us out. What's number three, Charli? Removing typical wording. So 99% of salespeople in that outreach will say things like I noticed this or I saw this. So how can we move away from this to start differentiating ourselves from the other salespeople? Alright. Let's talk about that one. So instead of saying, I noticed this or just wanted to or checking in or circling back, What in the world can I say instead of all those pleasantries or preambles? Get to the point. If you think about the amount of attention that you need to be getting from your buyers, whether it's an email or a call, you only have the beginning bit to grab their attention. So how can I grab their attention and be a pattern interrupt? And in my opinion, to do that, we should just be going straight into the juicy stuff. So, look, Armand, I was scrolling on your careers page. I found some of the information on the job spec for the SDR role you're hiring for really interesting. I just wanted to call you up to talk about this. Oh, it's Charlotte from SalesLoft, by the way. Instead of, hi, Armand. It's Charlotte from SalesLoft. Do you have thirty seconds for me to tell you why I've been so keen to speak to you today? Can you see the difference? So you're leading with all of that context upfront, which is the same way that I like to open my calls. How do people tend to react when you lead with that context instead of the thirty seconds or the how's your day going or did I catch you at a bad time? Think if you think about it, the only time you introduce yourself is on a sales call. So I don't call my mom and say, Hi, mum. It's Charlotte, your daughter. Or I don't call the doctors and say, Hi, it's Charlotte. I'll say what I'm wanting to do initially. So look, I'm looking to book an appointment. Or if I'm calling a delivery service that I'm I'm wanting to do this with the package that I've ordered. Right? So the only situation where we sales calls. And everyone knows that everyone hates sales calls, right? So why don't we just remove this so we sound less sales y? And to answer your question, like, what the responses I get, people just seem more open to chat to me because I'm not sounding like a typical salesperson. I don't sound like I want to sell them something. So can you talk a little bit about that, like, cold call opener, I guess, is what you would call it there? If I'm someone listening to this, how do I build that that opener where I'm ending with my contact information? Like, what what elements go into it? You need to do your research. So start with the bit of research that can link to your challenges, not, oh, we're this or we're that. Make it all about them. So whether that be their careers page, whether that be on the function section on their LinkedIn page and be like, look, You have a really sales account executive heavy sales structure. And I had a few questions around this. If you have a minute, it's Charlotte from SalesLoft, by the way. Because then I can link to the challenges I think they might be facing because of this. And it makes me more credible as well because I can create a hypothesis around that. So can we dig in a little bit more there? For everyone in the audience, SalesLoft is a competitor to Outreach. And, essentially, what you do is you allow reps to send cadences, emails every one day, two days, three days, and then mix in calls. Right? They allow sales reps to basically do marketing automation. Right? And so knowing what you know about SalesLoft, let's say you find out that someone has an account executive heavy structure. What might you do after that introduction as you start to weave your hypothesis into your cold call? Yeah. So I'll say, typically, when companies have account executive heavy structures and their full cycle, they'll have frustrations around, a, they don't prospect because they wanna focus on their deals. They prospect when they're low in pipeline, which is usually too late, and they don't prospect when they have a good pipeline. The second frustration is we all know AEs and salespeople suck at updating Salesforce. So it makes forecasting or getting visibility into what our deals look like really tough. And I'm wondering if any of these sound remotely familiar in your world. And it doesn't actually matter the challenges I usually say or the hypothesis I create. I've actually gained credibility from me being like, look. I've been researching you. I found out this. This tells me that big focus for yours might be this, and this is the two challenges that I typically hear. So from that credibility, people will sometimes they'll be like, yeah, you bang on, which doesn't always happen. But the situation we get a lot is, okay, kind of the first one, but the the frustration we're hearing more is, around this area here, and they might say something different. But because I've shared an experience and I've shared stories that other salespeople are telling me, I sound credible and I am credible. So they're gonna share what their actual challenge is instead of me being, like, doing the typical sales script y stuff. Like, we're the number one provider of this. So my guess is you get the standard objections, but very rarely is somebody not using any sales automation tool. You're probably calling on customers who all the time have something in place. So when you get hit with that competitor upfront, how do you handle that? Great that they have something in place. And I think this is where people kind of fall back with objections as they're like, oh, but we're better than them because we have this feature with which is better. And I just don't really believe in that because I think SalesLoft or Outreach are both incredible tools. I'd rather understand okay. That's really interesting. What actually made you bring it on in the first place? Ask more questions about it. Oh, you wanted to increase your pipeline. How much have you increased your pipeline since you've brought them on? Oh, you haven't? Okay. So tell me more about how you're planning on increasing that pipeline. Or they might absolutely love it. Tell me what you love about it. Okay. If you could have one extra thing, what would it be? Just really understanding, like, what they actually like, and is there anything that they dislike? And if they don't dislike anything, it's fine. My goal in a call isn't to book a meeting. It's just to kinda understand and have a conversation. I think that's where a lot of salespeople go wrong is they're like, I need to book the meeting. They go a little stressed, and they're like, I must book this meeting. But at the end of the day, like, if I don't pick a meeting after calling someone because they're really happy because they're with a competitor, great. Doesn't matter to me. Sometimes I struggle on cold calls where I do what you said, where I say a pretty specific problem, and I ask them, does that sound even remotely familiar? And they're still in their I'm getting cold called, I'm hesitant to engage phase. And so they give me, you know, the one word answer, like, sorta. Do you have any other approaches for, like, getting them to come out of their shell and, like, drawing them out so you can have a conversation? I think going back, like, when I do research on someone, I probably spend a good ten minutes researching each person. So I don't just come equipped with that one piece of information on their careers page. I also have other things and be like, okay. That's interesting. Look. The reason why I'm asking is in my research, I found this, this, and this, and this, which in my opinion could lead to these different avenues. I'm just trying to figure out, look, if there's a fit, then great. But if not, then I can I can leave you alone, and stop hounding you via email, calls, and LinkedIn? So keen to hear if any of these sound familiar with you. So let's talk about taking the jargon terms, the niceties, all of the BS out of emails. So you're leading in that first email. You've done this research. Maybe you've figured out they're hiring AEs. Maybe they're AE heavy. Do you just start with, hey. You're hiring AEs. SalesLoft can help you with pipeline. My guess is you're a little bit more slick than that. Right? Yeah. So I'll say things like scrolling on your careers page right now. You're hiring a ton of account executives. And I might even screenshot it, or I might do this in a video. And if I'm doing a video, I'm gonna share my screen. I'm gonna scroll on it while I'm saying I'm scrolling on your on your LinkedIn page or on your careers page. The this is telling me, if you're hiring a lot of account executives, this is telling me that there's a big focus right now on closing larger deals. The frustrations with this is A and B. We help. And one thing I want to make a note of is that I never tell people what SalesLoft do in my email, in my calls, in my videos. I don't tell people what SalesLoft does. I just say my research, I link it to the challenges, and I say, Look, we help. And if this is a frustration, then let's chat. We might not be able to solve your challenge, but let's just chat anyway. I'm an SDR. I use a lot of tools. And if it's not us that can help you, I can refer you to the right person that's helping me. I love that screenshot example. In the actual email, how are you attaching the screenshot? Is it, like, an attachment to the email? Are you embedding it in, like, the text? Does it come before your message? Is it all the way at the bottom? How does that work mechanically? Yeah. So on SalesLoft, you can just literally add an image, and you can change the size of it and things like this. And I like using pictures in my emails. Yeah. Do you have the debate over, oh, if you have pictures and you have links, is it gonna bounce and stuff like that. But I I kind of do it anyway because I'm like, look, if I'm sending this person loads of emails with images in and it's not receiving to them, then I'll take them out. But I like doing it because I think it's different, firstly. And I think it's more engaging. Like, I found this interesting. I'm gonna show you what I found interesting visually. See, I put it in there. Are you taking out the greeting entirely where you're not saying, like, hi, Nick, or hi, Charlie. Are you literally just starting with scrolling on your LinkedIn? My videos? Yeah. Sometimes I have been trying recently where I don't actually put someone's name at the beginning. I'll be like, scrolling on your LinkedIn right now, Nick, and then I'll go to the next bit. Sometimes I say hi when I feel like it. But a lot of the times I'll just say their first name a dash a dash and be like, really interesting reading this quote, and then I'll quote it or something. I don't think we need to be putting in, hey, hope you're well at that time at this time, or, hey, I wanted to tell you why I'm reaching out to you and I'm from SalesLoft. I just want to get straight into the juicy bit, especially with, well, actually, especially with every single person. Your buyers inboxes, their calls, their LinkedIn messages, they're literally so hectic, and they probably can't be bothered to hear all these repetitive emails and calls on LinkedIn. So why should we be repetitive salespeople, when we can stand out and remove them and create more of a fun experience for them. What most people don't realize is when your friends hit you up, I'm sure some people have your sales loft email or someone you've met in the past. If I were to send you a note, I wouldn't begin it with, hi, Charlie, as if you and I haven't met before. I would literally say, like, looks like you're crushing it and put the link to whatever the news was right below. And that's what's gonna pop up in the preview text. People don't realize is that preview text, those first 14 words of your email pop up in Gmail as the preview. And if all of the other emails say, hi, Charlie, and yours just starts with the point, that's far more likely to get opened. And I also wanna dig into your video framework here as well because I know you have some interesting tactics around breaking up the noise there. How do you approach your general video prospecting? So firstly, do good research. Don't just do, like, persona based challenges. I just I personally don't count that as personalization. Hi. You're a marketer. That means that, this must be your challenge. I think it it's it's good that we've finally got to this stage where we're not saying we do this, but I don't think that persona personalization is enough. So find a nugget of information that you think that no one's really gonna go on. And for me, I'll do things like I'll try and look from their perspective of what their challenges actually are. So looking at things like who their buyers are, who do they target. I'll go on their case studies and understand who their biggest customers are, what they sell. And from a point of view from SalesLoft, if they're selling to people like IT, they're really hard to get hard off. If if they're selling to enterprise people, they're 65% less likely to reply. So I'm getting into the mindset of them, and then I'm gonna use that as my ammo in my video. So research first, and then the structure of my video, I will firstly share my screen. I used to do this thing where I had a whiteboard and I said, Hey, their name, and then I would talk at them for forty seconds. And then I started seeing other people doing it. And I was like, Why does someone want to look at my face for thirty seconds? It's not that engaging. And I thought the whiteboard thing got a bit gimmicky in my my opinion. So I thought, why not share the research I'm doing? So I'll literally share my page on and I use Vidyard, and I'll share my screen on their LinkedIn page. And I will use a tool called Weava, w e a v a, to highlight it before. So I highlight stuff in, like, yellow. So when I switch tabs, you can literally see the bits that I wanna talk about. Look, looking on your LinkedIn, found this really interesting. You write about a responsibility here. Also, in the SDR role that you're hiring for, you repeat this responsibility. From this, I'm guessing that x is a focus for you, and the challenge around this is a and b. So my structure, what I'm the research I'm doing. Okay? Scrolling on your LinkedIn. This quote's interesting. This news article where you talk about this is interesting. From this, I'm guessing, and here I'm creating a hypothesis. Doesn't need to be right. Most of the time it's not right. And you can also make it a bit fun for your buyer. From this, I'm guessing and please poke holes if I'm completely wrong with my hypothesis here. But I'm guessing that there's a particular focus for you guys on increasing conversion rates. The typical challenges, number three, typical challenges, a and b. Two challenges. And then finally, we help with this. And if any of these are challenges that you're running into, let's chat. Arman, one of the things I've seen you do is you start on their LinkedIn page and you just click on the picture of them. So, like, when they open the video, it's literally just the picture of Nick's face there on the video. And how can you not watch that? And similarly, you're doing the same thing where it's like, here's your website, and I've literally annotated your website with this tool. Okay. Clearly, you've done your research because it's right there in front of of that person. I guess one thing I'm curious about because you clearly, you're doing a lot of research, and you also have goals in terms of meetings you need to book. And it can be really easy to go down the rabbit hole of research where you're you've spent forty seven minutes reading about Armand and his illustrious wrestling career and his corgi, and now you're like, oh, great. I've made no calls today. So how are you structuring your day as an SDR so that you get done what you need to get done? So I actually block out my calendar. I will click onto SalesLoft in the morning, and it'll tell me how many calls I need to do, how many emails I need to do, how many LinkedIn steps. And I personally want to reach out to 10 new prospects a day. So I add 10 new people into my pipeline a day. So I will then go, and I procrastinate a lot as a person, which is why I love highlighting my calendar. And I will go as far as highlighting tea breaks, a fifteen minute. I'm gonna have a cup of tea here, and I'm gonna chill with my puppy for fifteen minutes. And I will put time blocks in it and be like, and I'm not gonna do, like, an hour. I'm gonna work out how it takes me about five minutes per video. So I'm literally gonna do five times however many I need to do, and I'm gonna block out that fifty minutes. And then the next time I'm gonna block out time. I think that really helps me stick to a routine of what I need to do for the day. And if I run over, let's say at 11:00, I'm supposed to stop my videos and I'm running over, I stop them and I go on to the next thing. It's my own fault that I didn't get them done. So for me, over researching, I have fallen into that rabbit hole, but I wanna be reaching out to 10 people a day. So for me to do that, I can't be spending an hour on each person. I'll do ten minutes on the company, and I'll probably have about three or four people per company. And I'll spend an additional one or two minutes on their LinkedIn page. So when you talk about 10 new prospects per per day, my guess is that's the number that gets you to your quota. And so how did you arrive at that being your golden number versus 50 prospects per day or a 100 prospects per day or two prospects per day? So I did more at first. I think I was doing, like, 14 at first, and I found that the quality of my outreach was lower and I was getting less response rates. So I thought, hold on. If I spend an extra few minutes on their company and do things like understand their sales structure, understand who their buyers are, and spend more time on that, I actually found that I got more response rates from doing that little extra few minutes of research. So me personally, I have quite a personalized approach. I don't spend ages on it. I spend, like I said, ten minutes on an account and one or two minutes per person and maybe five minutes max on a video. So I don't spend a lot of time on it. And I think it depends on you and your company and, where where your company is. Because some people, they might need to do more activity. Whereas I found that personalization personally works for me to that level, so I only need to do 10. Whereas some people find that, oh, actually me making more calls works better for them. So I think it completely depends on you and the company. How do you decide who you're going to call? Because this is something I really struggled with when I was a new salesperson was, like, you feasibly could be calling, like, SDRs and AEs at other companies. I don't know if that, like, yields quality meetings for you, but they certainly answer the the phone, I guess. Like, how do you decide, alright. I'm gonna make 20 calls today. Here are the people that I'm going to choose to call. I go pretty senior in my view. And at the moment, I'm not calling HQ numbers. What I'll do in SalesLoft is I actually have a cadence which has direct dials. People that I think are gonna I'm not gonna spend an hour cold calling if I'm just gonna be ringing a load of HQ numbers and no one's gonna pick up. I might as well use that hour elsewhere to book meetings. So this is why we've created this direct dial agents where I can literally just go through. And if I'm like, okay. I wanna spend an hour calling, I can go through these people and call them because they're probably the most likely to respond because they have direct dials. So are you keeping dials outside of your cadence entirely and then overlaying a second dial cadence in case someone's callable? So I have it within my cadence step. So I have all my cool dials there. And if there's on the step and they have a cool step and they don't have a dial, I'm just gonna press skip step. But I also have the separate one because if I wanna do a power hour, I don't wanna be going through my cadence and being like, who can I call today? I'd rather just have a list and be like, I'm gonna go through these. And I'll also star people in SalesLoft who I've like, accounts that I really think I can get into, and I'm like, if you answer, I'm gonna book you. I star them. So when I do have maybe I'm ten days or I have an hour extra or something like that in my day, I want and I want to call, I'm gonna look for those star people that I really wanna get a hold of. What's funny is a lot of people, like, they ask us for tips on how do you handle gatekeepers or how do you handle the HQ number, dialing the tree, and all that stuff. And this might be, like, a total hot take. I don't call HQ numbers. The moment I find a gatekeeper, I don't even call the company anymore. Because do I wanna if I'm calling four or five people at, like, a large conglomerate, am I literally gonna call that same receptionist five times and be like, sorry. Like, your your CEO really gave it to me, but can you pass me to this guy to give me another shot here? It just doesn't work for me, but I don't know. Have you had a different experience? I used to call HQ numbers, and I'd occasionally get through. But the time I spent waiting on that hold music, that really annoying hold music where they're obviously playing a phone through a microphone or something. It just felt like a lot of wasted time for me. So, especially with COVID and everything, everyone working remotely. For me, stopping calling HQs, obviously no one's in the office, I get more responses from just direct dials. My pickup rate's quite high as well. I think it's, like, a solid, like, 20% at the moment, which is quite high. Charlie, this has been awesome. I I'm gonna have to rethink my approach to taking screenshots for my prospecting emails. I really love that one. But we're running out of time, and we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is we've talked about all sorts of wonderful things that salespeople, Nick included, can work into their lives. But now we gotta talk about a bad habit. So my question is, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to stop doing because it's hurting them more than it's helping? I think, a, talking about yourself, talking about your company and what your company do, and starting emails or calls about you, when you need to think of it in the in your buyer's shoes. And the second thing is I think a lot of people are too generic. I think we need to think of it from our buyer's point of view. If you're your buyer and you're getting all of these emails and all of these calls and all of these LinkedIn messages that are all monotonous, the same structure, it's irritating. Right? So how can I separate myself from all of the sea of sales reps out there to make an impact and a difference to my buyers to my buyers' life and to get rid of that perception that all salespeople are awful? So I think a big one is putting yourself in their shoes. And if you're sending an email that's templated and you think, I don't know if I would reply to this, don't send it. Personalize it and create an experience for them. This lead is a human, so make that human interaction and it creates a human experience. Beautiful. Charlie, anything you wanna plug before we jump off here? If you're looking to increase the amount of meetings you wanna book, you wanna manage your pipeline better, or get better at these two with coaching and training, then let me know. I think SalesLoft can help. And the other thing is that I'm gonna be starting a YouTube channel soon where I'm gonna be sharing some of the structures I use, some of, the kind of thought process I go through when I'm booking a meeting, when I'm researching and stuff like that. So I'm gonna be sharing a lot of actionable things that other SDRs can do to get better at their at their day to day role. So, follow me on LinkedIn and keep an eye out because I'm gonna be launching that soon. Beautiful. Everybody, go follow Charlie on LinkedIn and stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Charlie Johnson include, number one, cut out all of the pleasantries and all of the useless fluff in front of your email. That includes just following up, checking in, circling back, all that nonsense, and get right into your research. Number two, start the video on your research. The whiteboard thing, it might be dying out a little bit. You might choose to say like, hey. I was scrolling on your LinkedIn, and I saw you have these four job posts, and you might highlight that first. Number three, when you're sending an email, get creative with it. If you found that they have four job postings for sales reps and you're a sales tool, screenshot those four job postings, throw it in the email. And then lastly, number four, when you're picking up the phone, you guys know I love to heard the name tossed around opener, Charlie is also leading with context, leading with the most important piece of research she knows about that prospect and then gets right into it.
