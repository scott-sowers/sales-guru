## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to president's club. My name is Arman Farouk, and I'm here with my co host, Nick Sigelski. And we're here with the senior AE or the captain of being direct, the objection handling machine. It's Will Padilla. Nick, why should people listen? A lot of salespeople spend their entire career being subservient to their buyer and getting their kicked in every interaction with the customer. And Will is a master of being direct and getting himself on equal footing with the customer. And so I highly recommend you listen to how he challenges and pushes back and tells the buyer when they are making mistakes. In a three, two, one, you are making a mistake if you stop now. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Alright, Will. Welcome to the show. We start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Awesome. So, hey, my first tip is going to be, the one week rule for sending videos over LinkedIn. So, basically, what that means is when you wanna send a video, you're actually gonna get much higher reply rate from my experience over LinkedIn than you are email. So I have my reps send a connection, put the connection's name on a spreadsheet, and then also have a date marker. When that date marker hits a week, check back and see if they've accepted your connection. Good chance they did. Once they do, you're gonna wanna send a video. By sending the video, you'll say a script that goes something like this. This is what I have my reps do. Hi, so and so. I see you're at x y z brand, this title. I actually made you a quick video under sixty seconds how we're helping similar job titles from similar competitor brands accomplish x, save time on y, and get rid of z. Would love your thoughts in this quick sixty second video. Hope to hear from you soon. Beautiful. What's number two? In tip number two, basically, it's gonna be to never negotiate via email. This is a quick one, and this is for all the sellers to understand that, you know, we're humans too. And when a prospect or a buyer says jump, you don't have to say how high. So a lot of times, buyers and prospects will try to negotiate via email just because they can. So they might ask for a feature. They might ask for a lower price. So I'll simply respond. Hi, so and so. Appreciate the response. I don't negotiate via email as I do not view it as productive. I want this to be a win win situation. So when can you chat? Or something along those lines. So I say, I want this to be a win win, outcome. Can you chat on Tuesday or Wednesday? Very nice. Round us out, Will. What's number three? Number three would be the tag team with your account executive. So in the SaaS model, it's broken up as an SDR and AE model. So basically, I utilize my BDR's one hour sessions where I have her bring her top five prospects per week that she has not yet been able to get in touch with. So I'll help her out kind of as this, third voice. They might be used to hearing her voice or his voice, but they're not used to hearing mine. So I'll say, great, Laura. I'm gonna go ahead and call them on this meeting. So I'll call, and the call goes something like this. Hi. This is Will from so and so. I work very closely with Laura. We've been trying to get in touch with you about x, y, and z. We've actually sent you an email about how we're helping similar brand in your space, accomplish x, save time on y, and eliminate z. Again, this is Will from so and so. No need to give me a callback here. Laura is actually gonna send you an email right now with the subject line. Will just left you a voice mail. Feel free to reply that via email. No pressure in giving me a callback. Hope to hear from you soon. Alrighty. Well, so in in the prep, one of the things that we learned is you are extremely direct, and I love this premise of if a prospect says jump, you don't always have to say how high. K? One place this will oftentimes happen is to your point, it's when someone's asking for pricing, whether live or oftentimes they'll be asking for pricing on the very first call. And so if someone earlier than you expect is asking you for pricing and just trying to get a quote out of you, my guess is you're not just saying, no. You can never have this quote. Right? How do you handle someone in that moment? Right. So if someone's asking price, I'm gonna give it to them, but I'm gonna give them a range. So I'll say, hey. For the price, you can expect from here to here. And I'll simply pause with no explanation of why that range is that range and get their reaction. I'm trying to get out of them what is what's expensive to you, what's not. I'm not playing games here. I just gave you a range. So let's figure out what your range is. Because if you're gonna start asking questions, I wanna understand what's high to you, what's low to you, what did you expect, are you conditioned from other competitors who have given you a different rate and this is now surprising. And so I love this because a lot of times sellers will barf up. These are all the factors that impact it, and I tend to do the same. Right? And so you give them all the information they need, but by leaving it open ended, you actually force them to explain where they are already anchored. Right? And so let's say that well, you give me a range of we'll call it some preposterous range of ten to a hundred thousand dollars. And I go, well, that's a really big range, and you mirror me. And I say, well well, look. I mean, I I've looked at a lot of your competitors, and a lot of your competitors are at the $30 range. And so if we're in the bottom of that range, we're good. If you're gonna charge me a $100, like, it's absolutely crazy. And so what do you do once I finally give you some skin in the game and I explain where I'm anchored? Right. So I totally validate you, and I'd say, got it. I totally understand where you're coming from. So it sounds like price is a priority, and from what you've been conditioned to in the past from other softwares, this price seems a bit high. Totally get that. And so I just gave you a range. That being said, typically, the next step would be to schedule a custom pricing call. On a custom pricing call, we can walk through exactly what you're looking for, the variables, and the plan that you need, and we could come to a conclusion that ideally would be a win win. So what I'm doing there is I'm getting commitment. Because what a lot of sellers do is they'll say, oh, my range is this. Well, it comes with this feature, and you're gonna get this. You're gonna get that. And, well, the price is, this way because the buyer has everything they need to ghost you. You do not want to be ghosted. You want commitment from the prospect. So let's play a game. They want a custom price. I want a second call to give and take. So what you're doing is you're actually invoking a rule of reciprocity there where customer asks you for the price, and you're not hiding it from them. You're giving them the information that they asked for, but not the entire story. Right? They probably need more information just beyond the dollar value, terms, for example, related to that price. And they're going to want that information. But because they're asking you for something, you have the right to ask questions back around their expectations, where they're anchored. Did they get that from a competitor? And now you're bringing yourself back on equal footing. So let's let's take this a little bit further. Will, one other thing that happened as part of that is you did not explicitly engage in this long competitive rant around how you're a premium solution or how you're better, what have you. Are you saving that for the next call because you now have that information? Or at what point and how do you start engaging in the competitive battle? That's a great question. So the competitive battle is something all sellers have to deal with. You just have to know when do you want to pick that battle. So I'll have to understand what solution they're on, if they're not on a solution, who else they're looking at. So I'll have to do all that proper discovery first. But let's just say, you know, someone is telling me that they think x, y, z, and competitor is better, or why don't you have this. I know a lot of people aren't a huge fan of this, but I'm a big fan of the takeaway method. I'll say, great. So it sounds like that platform's gonna solve a lot more of what you're looking for. I'd actually recommend you check them out. If anything changes, you can always hit me back, and we can do a second call. So I always like to pull away because I don't like to get in this rant where I'm begging for someone's business bashing a competitor. I just want information. I want to I want the prospect to understand that I'm a consultant, not a sales rep. I'm here to recommend you what is best for you. And if that is away from us, I will do so. And so a lot of times, I'll say the line. Hey. So it sounds like it's just too early for you right now for this. And they'll freak. They're like, this sales rep's not gonna show me the demo. How dare he? So they'll go off. What do you mean? Show me the tool. I mean, I'm just telling you, it sounds like it's too early. These are the factors I'm hearing. Based on what you said, recommend this. And what's crazy is they get this. I can't believe this sales rep is doing this, and what is he not showing me? So I'll have buyers flip script in the middle of a rant at me. I can't believe you won't show me the tool. Like, fine. You know what? I know what I said. I can I can make budget for this? Let let show me the tool. I can make budget for this. Let's see if it can happen, and I'll show them the tool, and I'll I'll do multiple takeaways throughout. But, hey. You know, this feature here, I think it could be really great for you. But, you know, as you mentioned, you just don't have the budget. Oh, no. We're gonna make budget. This is cool. We're gonna make it happen. And it always hap or I'll have someone I'll say go to that competitor, and then they're like, fine. I'll go to that competitor. They leave the call. They might they might drop the call. I'll get a message from them two days later. Hey, Will. I'd love to talk to I'd love to talk to you again. I talked to that competitor. It didn't really work out. So to pull it up, earlier in the interview, you did something where instead of giving someone price on the spot, right, you used price as the gate to set a next step. And the reason for that is you recognized buying intent. And so you want to continue to rope that prospect in. Right? But you're actually doing the opposite when you explicitly don't see buying intent. In other words, if you get someone who's saying, I don't have budget. I don't have pain points. This is a nice to have, but I wanna see your software. Right? You're actually creating another gate to get them to show that buying intent. In other words, you need to earn the right to see a proposal. You need to earn the right to see software. And the way you're gonna earn the right is by explaining to me why you are going to buy this thing. Is that right? That's exactly right. And it's fun. Will, one of the places that even before a sales cycle, you might not have that leverage is when you're cold calling. And I know you also have some pretty direct ways that you handle objections over the phones. And so one of the most common objections that you'll get that is a similar gating effect to the one that we talked about is people will say, send me an email or give me a summary of what you do. Right? And it really just feels like a SWOT, and we all know that no one actually wants to see that email. And so what do you do when someone says, well, just send me some information. I'd be happy to look at it. Yeah. I'd say, hey. So and so. I get it's a cold call. I get you didn't wanna take this call. I know it was out of the blue here. But what exactly would you like in that email? And Got it. Hey. An overview, a case study or something like that. Totally get it. Hey. Typically, I'm not labeling you as such, and I might be misreading this. But typically, when someone tells me that, they're just trying to brush me off the phone. If you feel that's you, that's totally okay. But here's exactly why I was calling. Would there be someone better to speak to about this? And then I try and figure that out. I like that. You're doing the disarmingly blunt approach where you're calling out what's actually happening. If you sense it, say it. But then you're reorienting back around your value proposition or problem proposition of the reason that you called them specifically. How about if they're like, I don't take cold calls? I say I don't take cold calls. Got it. So when's a better time to chat? One of the toughest objections that oftentimes get is someone will just be like, oh, I'm not interested. Right? And it's clear they weren't even listening in the first place. And so what do you do when someone's just trying to swap you out? Hey. Got it. Not interested. What are you interested in? That's so good. I really like that, actually. One of the things that I'm actually really impressed by, Will, and and folks listening to the interview might not appreciate it because you're listening to a tape delay, is, like, I'm asking you the objection, and you've got the response right away. Like, it's clearly drilled into your head to the point that there's no hesitation or delay. And I think that's important because when you are making cold calls, you're in this emotionally turbulent space. I don't care care how long you've been selling. It's hard when you get punched in the face with, I'm just not interested. Right? But if you expect yourself to be able to think through how to respond to those things in real time, you're screwed. But because you have that drilled into your brain, it's like a reflex. That's why you're probably nailing your cold prospecting. Will, there's one more scenario that I wanna ask you about that was in the prep doc, and it's when you're on a discovery call with a customer, and they don't want you to show a slide deck. And I have struggled with this one because in my last sales job, I was, like, sort of mandated. Here's the deck you have to go through every time to frame the problem. And I had a lot of resistance because my customers had a lot of resistance to seeing a slide deck. So how are you teeing up the slide deck in and then what is the customer saying when they resist it? And then how are you sort of overcoming that or or being direct to say, you're gonna see this thing? Yeah. Well, I'm like you. I I'm in the same position where I have a slide deck that's you know, I wouldn't say mandated, but it's, hey. This is company policies. This is how we run things. We need you to share the slide deck. So when a a lot of times, a prospect will say, I need to see a slide deck. Let's just go to the demo. I call it out. I'm very direct. Again, they don't run the show. Like, it's a it's a two way street. So I'll say, hey. Just gonna state this. I view that would be a huge mistake. Typically, when sharing our narrative deck, it'll actually save a lot more questions that you might bring up in the demo by going over our narrative. What they say is, alright. Cool. Let's go through it. Because they also don't wanna waste time. They also don't wanna have weird questions come up that they missed in the narrative deck. The three things that I pulled out from what you did there, your tone was extremely confident and direct. You were like, this is natural to be, hey. You're making a mistake. You actually challenged them and called out this would be a mistake, which is important because very few salespeople actually say that. And then you finish by framing the reason that following the course of action you want to was beneficial. This is going to save time in the demo. And so because you were confident, because you called out this is an error, this is a mistake, this is a concern, and then you gave them a here is why, it's extremely tough to say no to that. Well, I actually wanna jump all the way back to what we covered in the beginning of the interview, which was your actionable takeaway around not giving price over email, right, and making sure that you wanted to land on a win win. One of the things that oftentimes happens is you get onto these proposal calls, and especially today, if you finally give them that ultimate pricing amount of 50 k or a 100 k, people are puking all over it. And there are a lot of sellers who are bending over backwards and giving 50% discounts left and right. And so let's say you get onto the call, you walk them through the proposal, and you hit them with the 50 k number. Right? And they freak out. My guess is you also have a direct answer for this. So so what do you do in that moment when someone flips out and thinks you should be half the price? Yeah. So that happens all the time. So what you don't wanna do as a seller is do what you said of the, oh, I'll give you a 50% discount or I'll do this. You don't wanna do anything. You wanna share your standard pricing. Wait for a reaction. When the reaction comes, then understand, as you said, 50 k is too much. What do you mean by too much? Well, we had budgeted this. Well, who gave you that budget? Is there any flexibility? Let's let's go let's go deeper. But what I'll do is I'll say, got it. So it sounds like this price is too high. Would you agree with that? Okay. Great. So here's what I'm gonna need from you. I can go to bat for you and get you a custom plan. Most likely. I'd have to ask, but most likely. Here's what my VP is gonna ask. He's asked a couple questions. One, when can you sign? Two, would you be open to and this is where you wanna get. You wanna get. Would you be open to a case study? Would you open to a webinar in your six months of contract or twelve months of contract? So I'm down to go go to bat for you, but here's the two things that I need from you. And nine times out of 10, they're down to play ball. I can sign this week. And, yeah, I'm down to do a case study. Show me the best rate you got. And I say, got it. I'll hit you back via email with the rate that my VP approves. You don't ever wanna promise anything on the call. You want a get to then give them a discount. So in that scenario, you are going back to your VP or you know that you have a certain rate that you're approved at. Let's say the price you presented was 50 k. How do you choose where to price them at when you come back to them? So at the 50 k mark, I'm gonna say, got it. This is the plan that you wanna go with. Correct? The price is just the issue. So I I wanna nail down that that's the plan they want. Because, for example, as sales reps, we have a bunch of different plans. But if they have the problem with the plan that you're talking about, the 50 k, I wanna nail down that that is the plan they want, but the only issue is the price. So that's it. Price is the issue. Now let's start to play ball. You're gonna give me a signature by this week. You're gonna give me a case study, or you're gonna give me a customer referral. And my VP, we can make something custom for you. Very nice. Well, Will, we're running out of time here, and so we gotta move ourselves to the, the final question. And so the last question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. So the last question is, what is one bad habit you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Cool. Hey. So the one mistake I see a lot of sales reps make, and this goes for both AEs and BDRs, is to stop saying it doesn't work. You have to ask yourself, are you actually giving it an honest try? If you sent 10 videos and you say, oh, it doesn't work, I'm gonna stop, Send a 100 more. I mean, seriously, you have to give yourself a good sample method. And the it doesn't work line, in my opinion, comes from a lot of victim mentality in sales. You can't be a victim. You gotta be the a boss of your own day, and you gotta say it didn't work because it may not have worked because and let's tweak some things. You can't just say blanket statements of it doesn't work because that's gonna be detrimental for your sales career. Boom. Will, thank you so much for joining us. Everybody, stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Will Padilla include number one, when you're asked for price, give a range. But that's it. Don't explain how it works until they explain where they are anchored within that range. Number two, if you're getting ongoing buying objections or you get someone who's just sort of being lukewarm, all you need to do is hit them with, it sounds like this is just too early for you. And then make them explicitly opt in to the sales cycle. Number three, if someone says send me some information, ask what they wanna see, then explain that most of the time. This usually just means that they don't wanna talk to you anymore. Is there someone else we should be talking to, or are you the right person? And then lastly, number four, before giving any discounts, get clear commitment on timing. And if it's not a clear commitment, make it abundantly clear that if there is a slip, it starts back at standard pricing. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out? It would be meaningful if you left thirty minutes to president's club a review because I like reading reviews of the show. You can say things about my high voice. You can say things about Arman's pleasant demeanor. You could say things about the stuff you've learned on the show, but I need something to do over the holidays, which is when we're recording this episode. So please give us a review, and we'll see you next week on thirty minutes to Presidents Club.
