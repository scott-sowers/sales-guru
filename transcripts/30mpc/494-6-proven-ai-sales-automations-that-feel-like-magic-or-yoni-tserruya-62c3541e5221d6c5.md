## Transcript

Reps should spend all day long in front of customers and be the human being in front of human being and build trust. We try to take all the non selling activity, everything that happened behind the scene, the admin work, and automate them, you're doing it in very small steps. To survive this AI revolution, you need to learn how to use it. So each one of the people in your organization can become a superhuman. And superhuman means they spend time with customers and build trust and all the rest will be taken by AI and will help you do the your work much better. What's going on, folks? Salespeople, if you are doing anything like list building or meeting prep or recap emails or trying to break down your own calls and you are doing that stuff annually, you are probably throwing 80% of your working hours in the trash because using a lot of the very basic AI tools out there today, you can take 80% of the sales grunt work that you used to do, get a machine to do it, and spend 20% of your time actually directing and thinking about how to unblock a deal, not how to scribe a recap email. So today, we are going to walk through six of the most common places you can automate your sales process using AI. And we've brought on the one and only CEO of Lucia who has taken his sales team and automated all six of these steps in the sales cycle, and he's gonna break down exactly how he did it. So, Nick, what are those six areas? So the six places we're gonna be focusing today are list building, finding signals or reasons that you might wanna reach out to a potential person or account. We're gonna be talking about call prep. We're gonna be talking about icebreakers for when you get on a call with your prospect. We're gonna talk about recap emails, and then we're gonna talk about AI coaching. The first question, Yoni, is could you talk to me about the list building and how you've started to incorporate or build AI tools to help with that? I think the first thing about list building is that, as we all know, list building is a very high time consuming task of a day to day rep. And by that, I mean that what we did in Lucia, if you take a a sample of, for example, your recent 20 closed won deals from your CRM in the last six six months, and you're gonna give it to AI, it can it can build the the list for you in a much better way so you can save all your time of finding ICPs and let AI build the list for you so you can spend more time with customers. But if you're gonna give this sample to AI, it But if you're gonna give this sample to AI, it it can take into account many more parameters and just give you better ICP and even account that you you didn't even thought that can be in your territory and in your, opportunities. This is one of the things that we think today AI can really help reps and save time. So you basically can be in a point that you upload a list, you give that AI the GPT or any other service like Lucia or any other service that support that, you can give it the list in your territory, and it can build you unlimited list of companies in your ICP in an automatic way. So if I have a list of 20 closed won deals, and let's say for today, I plug those in the chat GPT. My guess is you don't just say, like, great. Take these 20 and find me a 100 more. Are there certain parameters where you're like, hey. Find these things in common with these 20 deals, or could you pull out the things that these 20 deals have in common? Like, where do you go once you plug in the 20 closed won companies into your GPT? Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. So I think maybe in GPT, you need to give it a bit more instructions because he might he is not trained for sales. So but if you're gonna, instruct the GPT that please please match the territory, the company size, the industry, and the things that's important to you, then I think it can do a pretty good job. And, yes, and you just can ask him, give me 100 more. If you're gonna go to a sales intelligence platform that designed for sales, you don't need to instruct it. It already knows what kind of parameters you need to take into account, and it might need even it might even take into account parameters you didn't even think about. But but chat ChatGPT can definitely work for you. You might need to work a bit more for that, and it's still gonna save you tons of time. Yeah. Oftentimes, when I'm prompting ChatGPT for stuff like this, I've helped other reps build account lists. And I'll usually say, like, take these 20 close one deals, and these are the five things that I think lead us to believe a customer is good. Mhmm. I want you to take these five things and come up with five more parameters on your own and use that to show me what do these 20 closed one deals have in common. And that's, like, the first prompt. And then the second prompt is like, okay. Now you found the common thread, and you might say, like, oh, like, two of these were criteria that you suggested. They just hired a compensation person, and maybe they raised around in the last six months. Right? And then the third criteria would be, like, something that GBT found that you wouldn't have found on your own as a human being. Like, oh, the champion just got hired on the state or something like that. Then you can prompt it again and be like, great. Can you find me ten, twenty, 30 companies that have these attributes and explain why they have these attributes? And I've done this with some of my advisory clients, for example, a company named Practice who oftentimes sells to tutoring companies. And I'll be like, these tutoring companies, I think, have these three things in common. Go find me 10 other tutoring companies that look like this, and it puts together, like, a pretty damn good targeted a tier list for you at least to start with. I think the most exciting part about it is you can find accounts that nobody at your company has ever reached out to before. I remember when I sold to law firms, I would always be like, oh, man. I've reached out to every single law firm in my territory. I've reached out every law firm that's in California, Arizona, and Nevada. There's no more I can reach out to. And then, like, a day later, I would get an inbound request from a a law firm that I didn't even know existed. And so I think one of the coolest things about this is you're actually gonna discover accounts that are totally untapped, and those ones are fresh. They haven't been hammered by every single SDR or salesperson at your company. So once I've built my lists and I know all of the companies I'm gonna reach out to, one perspective that you have is that I shouldn't just be indiscriminately reaching out to every single company with equal effort. I know you're a fan of, signal based reach out. And so I'm wondering if, one, you can explain what signal based reach out actually is, and then, two, some of the ways that you've automated this stuff. Yeah. I think one of the challenges is that, especially if you have a big ICP accounts list, you don't wanna reach out to them in a round rubin or one by one and and help for, for good, luck. It just most of them are not in market at any given moment. So what you really wanna do is to identify the signals that increase the probability that those accounts might be in market right now. Increase the probability that might they might buy from you. So in our case, for example, at Lucia, the kind of signals that we are looking for are examples like we're looking for companies that executives in the sales department just hired. It can be CRO, VP of Sales, VP of Revenue Operations, anyone that is senior enough that if you just hire, there's a good probability that he will start making changes right now. Another signal can be that the company is hiring a lot of reps, or just open a new site, or just integrated a technology that completes our solution, that released a new product and they just need to now try to engage a lot of customers. Anything that identify trends that sales organization now needs to kick in, those are the things that for us works better than just reaching out to companies without those signals. The beautiful thing about, signals is just you have signals every day. Like, things happens in the world. So if you have a list of big ICP, but you are working on the ones that you got signals yesterday, and only work on the ones with the the best signals first, you're basically work on your ICP in the most relevant way possible, and you just spend time with the most relevant accounts at every given moment. So we have this concept that we call first is best, which is normally what you do is you say these are the top three or four signals for my business, and you stack rank them. And then you say, like, okay, mister and missus SDR. Look at your first account and look for signal one, two, three, four, and five. And then once you find the first signal, don't go on to two, three, four, and five. Stop because the first one is the one you should use in your outreach. And that's just because you don't have so much time to outreach. But what you can do now is you can take that same list that you plugged in the GBT. You could say, hey. Take these 10 accounts that you found, these 10 look alike accounts that you found, and I want you to put them in a table. And I want you to take our top five signals, these five, and I want you to put a check mark if we have that signal or an x mark if we don't. And literally in seconds, you will have your top 10 accounts with all five of your top signals, and you might be able to write an email that has, like, three signals inside of it that are your three best signals on your a tier accounts. And that's something that normally would have taken you way, way, way, way longer if you didn't have AI, if you didn't have a GPT, or if you didn't use a tool like Lucia, which does a lot of the stuff for you automatically. Automatically. Right? Armand, I'm curious. What were some of the signals that you and your teams would look for when you were leading teams at Carta and Pave? Yeah. So, for example, Carta sells a valuation, which is called a four zero nine a valuation, not to be confused with the cleaning solution four zero nine. And, basically, you need to get a four zero nine a valuation every time you get a funding round or upon your anniversary of the funding round. It's called a material event. And so anytime someone was hitting their funding anniversary, that was an immediate trigger. That was one. They also had to do something called ASC eight twenty expense accounting. Yoni, you're nodding because you probably are familiar with all this stuff. Yeah. We're doing it every year, and that's exactly the time we're doing it. Exactly. Right? And so three months before your anniversary, I'm already in your inbox. Right? But what if you're not on the anniversary? Well, the second thing is if you're series b and c, usually when you cross, like, the $10,000,000 revenue mark, you start to, like, worry about audit risk a little bit more, and you need to do this thing called expense accounting where you basically expense your options on your profit and loss statement. And that's really painful to do. Carta automates it for you. So then we would look at companies who were just crossing over into the series b and c threshold. So that would be like our second one. The third one would be if someone hired a controller. That meant someone was taking over the accounting process because it was getting more complicated. So you can take these signals, one, two, three, etcetera, and stack rank them. And if we could find two or three of those, then we pretty much were shooting fish in a barrel. When I sold to law firms, we would look for things like new hires, specifically if they had hired a new, like, CFO, COO, or firm administrator, which was another leadership position at law firms. We would look for things like if they had announced a new practice group, which often meant that the law firm was looking to grow. And when they added a new type of law that they were practicing, that often added a lot of, like, accounting complexity, which is the tool that I I sold could help with. We would also look for things like if they o were opening a new office because that often meant that they were growing. And, And, frankly, we would also look for things like were they publishing, like, thought leadership content? Were they speaking at industry events? And so I would literally go through my list one by one by one, and that would be how I would choose who to reach out to. But I think it's really interesting if you can feed your AI with all of those signals. It can write an email and be like, hey. I saw you just hired Mary and Dave, your managing partner, spoke in an event recently, and I know you've got a new office opening. These are all reasons we should be talking, and that's so much more powerful than just one. And I actually think that's one area that, like, I always had the perspective that AI was, like, a great way to send more meh emails. I actually think it's a great way to say it send more better emails, and that's been a paradigm shift that I've had recently. So let's talk about the next one, which is you've built your list, you've found your signals, you've reached out to some people, and you actually get some meetings. Let's talk about call prep. Talk to me about some of the AI use cases in call prep that you and your team have been using. So we've built internally in Lucia a meeting preparation agent that takes all the information that the representative need to know before a meeting. So it takes for example, you're meeting with a company, then it takes all the trends that happen in those this company, the recent news, the gross rates, all the information that is necessary. It gives you information on the people you are about to meet and the decision makers that are not in the meeting, but you might need to re to to to find a way to get to them. And also the usage information if you are, you know, a freemium service and you already have usage and you give also information about that. And we send it automatically to every rep, like, one or two hours before the meeting so they can have all the information they need before the meeting. And I think it not only just save time and reduce the the meeting preparation time. A lot of salespeople just don't do it properly, you know, because it's time consuming and it requires a lot of work. So, you know, to just save this time, you're basically preparing them in a much better way to the conversation, and it's in front of them during the whole conversation so they just can just look at it and and be better on targeting the calls and questions, to the right place. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. This is one where I remember at three or 4PM every single day, it was my least favorite part of the day. I would write five recap emails back to back, and then I would do five prep docs for the next day. And it was the exact same template. It was what you talked about, Yoni. So I would literally pull everything we pulled in step one, which is, like, this is why I believe this customer's ICP employee range, growth, recent news, funding, etcetera. Number two, these are the signals I saw in the company, AKA my point of view on why I think they're in a buying window. So recent funding, hitting their anniversary between series b and c, which means they need expense accounting, etcetera. And then number three, I'd be like, these are the people that I'm meeting with and then want to get in front of. So it'd be usually everyone at the line and then the person above the line that I wanted to ask for an intro to. And so I'm curious. Is there anything else that you're putting in your pep doc where you're like, like, make sure that you ask GPT to put this in a table, or is that, like, the gist of what goes inside of the Lucia agent? For us, it took few iterations to make it, like, right for us. At the beginning, I think we need to set expectation. There is one part of building the agent and the and the preparation text, but then you need people to adopt it. So at the beginning, not all of the reps adopted it, and we started to ask them why. And then we refine it up to a point that it wasn't too long, wasn't too short, was in the right order, gave them the right, you know, titles in front of them and it's going to be easy to read. I think it's going to be very different from company to company, and it requires feedback from the reps to iterate a bit or the reps, he needs to do it for himself and he just needs to see what works for him. And after a few iteration, I think you can make an agent or a text summary that is really fit for you and for your need that it's easily readable and exactly what you want. The beautiful thing is that you just do it with plain English, and you can iterate it very fast up to a point that you really love how it's built and and what you get. This is one area that kind of drives me crazy when it comes to AI adoption with reps. I was talking to a really, really sharp rep the other day, and he was like, yeah. You know what? I guess AI can help with stuff like call prep, but by the time I, like, give it a prompt, read what it sent me, fix fix it, give it another prompt, reprompt, reprompt, reprompt, reprompt, I could have just done it by hand by myself, and I would have saved time. And I'm like, yeah. That's true, but you only have to, like, get it right once. Like, the iterative stuff, yeah, it takes more time to set it up once, but then every other call is going to be faster and easier. And so if you're a rep who's watching this, who's like, yeah. This AI stuff is great, but, like, I've gotta tinker with it too much to get it right. Like, you've gotta recognize that anytime you're adopting something new, it's gonna take some time to actually set it up properly. But then the rest of your life, it's going to save you time. So I'm laughing because right now, both Nick and I are looking at the camera. And the reason for that is we both have at home camera setups. And both Nick and I are probably the worst possible human beings you would ever meet when it comes to technology. So right now, like, Nick's camera, if you watch on YouTube, it's hanging on this thing that Nick refers to as the appendage, which is this mechanical limb that retracts from his desk that holds a camera on top of it. And for our first, like, 10 recordings, his, like, appendage would be, like, falling on the table. His light would be falling down. He'd be cussing in the middle of an interview, and we couldn't get any of it done. And we'd be like, this is so dumb. In this time, we could have just gone to a studio. And the answer is, yes. That is correct, but you're equating going to a studio to building a studio at home. So now that we actually understand how cameras work, it's very easy to set up, but we had to go through the trial period of tinkering with the appendage for seventeen hours of recordings, which was a very painful experience. You're gonna get us canceled. You just talked about me putting my appendage on the desk, and I'm tinkering with my appendage during the interview. Like Ring light. Whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. There's one there's one, one other note that I wanna double down on that you shared, Yoni, as you talked about the concept of and, Arman, you briefly mentioned it. Having the agent tell you the people who are not in the room that you might wanna get in front of. And one of the best hacks that I ever learned for getting to power when you're setting next steps is not to ask for who should we talk to next or what are next steps or hey. Do you think we could get this in front of your CFO? It's to name drop. Hey. Do you think we could get this in front of Yoni? Or, hey. For our next meeting, do you think it might make sense to involve Armond, your head of rev ops? And when you name and drop those people, it does two things. One, the buyer, like, sort of sits back for a second, and they're like, okay. I respect you. Like, you actually did your prep for this one. And one thing that I think a lot of salespeople don't recognize is, like, when you show up and you've done your prep, the buyer is actually gonna raise their level of respect for you even if they're way more senior than you. They can be 56 years old, gray hair, and you might be a new rep who, like, doesn't know as much as the other reps that maybe that exec is talking to. But if you've shown, hey. I've done my prep for this thing. I did that prep doc that you talked about. I know the people who probably need to be involved in this sale, and I'm name dropping them my name. They're like, alright. Like, game recognized game. Like, I've got some respect for this rep. The other thing is that, like, it's this subtle thing where they're like, oh, like, yeah. I guess Anna is the person we might wanna involve instead of forcing them to scan their brain for, like, wait. Who's our VP of rev ops again? Do I need to get them involved in something like that? So it's a really, really subtle thing, but it's very, very powerful when you are looking to drive next steps with your prospect. Yoni, let's talk about how you use this prep doc to come with icebreaker ideas. So, yeah, why why don't you break it down? Yeah. So icebreaker we built internally an icebreaker agent that helps you get personal with your approach to the person you're reaching out to. And that can be with the email, with the call, that you are just making to the person, and that and with that, it's just this agent takes information about the person that can help you open the conversation. It can be the recent post that he just published on LinkedIn. It can be his job experience. It can be where he learned, and it can be, like, news on the company. But it should be something that happened recently. Mhmm. That if you are open, your approach with it, it's exactly what you said, Nate. It feels like you did your homework and you really care about him, and you just reach out personally. And and it feels like, oh, you like, you did your stuff. You really care about me. I need to listen. It's not just you're reaching out in a generic approach with the job title. For example, if people reach out to me, hey, Yoni. I saw you are the CEO of Lucia, or hey, Yoni. I saw Lucia is in the sales intelligence platform. That generic approach, it's a template. You can send it to any any other people, any other CEO in the world. But if you send me an email, I saw your recent post about how you eat your own dog food in the company. That's really, like, inspired me or whatever it is, then, I mean, I must read it. I feel like he knows me and, and it's a different So I think this icebreaker agent helps you attract stuff and give you opening lines. It can really make your approach much easier. So what would be some like example things I would ask a GPT to come up with or, like, example icebreaker lines that we can, like, reference for inspiration? You can give the GPT, like, a name of a person and a name of a company. And then that you tell the GPT, like, go bring the three last posts of this person and the three news items that you find on the web or the three news on this company, and bring the most relevant ones or the most recent ones and build me three ice breaking lines to open the conversation in a personal approach and friendly approach that he can feel like I know him for a while. This prompt, if you have enough information on the web, it can give you few very beautiful ideas, and and then you can use it to to make it personal. I want you all to, like, imagine a Venn diagram, which is there's everything that your product can do, and then there's everything that's going on in your prospect's life. And then there's a middle ground. And so the stuff that's going on in their life that doesn't matter is, like, irrelevant personalization. For example, Yoni, I know you really like eating Swedish dumplings. I don't know. Right? That has, like, nothing to do with Lucia. It might be interesting. You may be like, okay. But it has nothing to do with the problem that you solve at the company. Right? And ideally, what you can do is you can say, like, hey, GPT, find me five things that are personal or interesting about the company that I can actually relate to the problem that I can solve. And that's the sweet spot is it's both personal and relevant, not just random personalization. I'm just thinking about someone who might sell to chefs or restaurants and the Swedish dumpling thing, but we'll move on. I'm, I could go down a rabbit hole with that one. So okay. We do all of this stuff. We book the meeting. We've got the great ice breaker. The meeting goes well. I now need to send my prospect a recap email. And this is one thing where, yeah, Arman, I remember you would always cram all of your recap emails to the very end of the day because you were like, I don't want this to distract from all of my other stuff, and it was your most hated thing. Talk to me about how your team is literally saving hours every single day on recap emails, Yoni. So yeah. So there are two parts for the recap. One, the the the the things that we did in Lucia, we downloaded the transcript of the meeting, and then you can upload it to a GPT that will help you generate, summarize for the CRM and all the information that is necessary for the CRM with the field that you need to fill. And also write a follow-up email with a summary of the discussion, the action items, and everything you wanna be part of this summarized email and just send it to your customer. You can do it in a full automated way so that the even this we did it in a way that the CRM will be filled automatically so that today's salespeople in Lucia does not fill the CRM after the meeting anymore. It took us few months to get there, but they just hang up the the the meeting, and that's it. So it's beautiful. And the CRM is is is the data is stored, like, like, better than ever before. And the email summarize is something that they can take as a template or as a suggestion. They can refine it if they want, but they can just send it. And you can make that automatically as well if you trust it after a period of time. But this is something that is, you know, it's pretty technical and you can really take it off your day to day plate. The vision is to put you just in the conversation and do all the rest for you behind the scene. And this is just a beautiful example of things that can be done easily with transcript and agent. From your perspective, how should a good recap email be structured? Because I've seen GPTs spit out recap emails that are, like, 47 pages long, and I, like, I'm I know prospects aren't going to read that. So, like, what are some of the main chapters of a good recap email from your perspective? I think it's good to recap, like, the customer pains and what he described in the conversation because it's all about his paints first. And then you can, a few points about how can your service help them be better and solve their paints. And then three action items or whatever you, agreed on within the conversation that needs to be the next steps. I think that should be the basics. You can add more sections, but it should be like I think this is the main three sections that interesting. And, of course, like, good opening and personal approach at the beginning is also good. One one area a lot of salespeople get things wrong. I even got this wrong when I was a newer seller. I was like, why do I need to recap the pain points that they had? Like, I'm sending this email to a person who they told me those pain points. They know them. And the thing that a lot of salespeople don't realize is you're not writing that recap email for your prospect. You're writing it for their boss who they're gonna forward it to, and they're gonna say, hey. I met with Arman today. Check out this recap. And you've gotta lead with the problem before you can get to the solution because, otherwise, their boss is gonna see that forwarded recap email that starts with the solution and be like, I don't even know why we need a solution in the first place. And so you start with the problem. You follow it. Here's how we make that problem go away. One thing that I've actually done a little bit differently is I've actually it's been experimenting with moving my next steps to the top to inspire them to take act because, like, sometimes they'll still skim it. And so that's been one area I've done it a little bit differently. The way that I structure them is next steps, pain points, how we help. But I suppose you can do both. If you wanna be a little bit maniacal around formatting like I am, unfortunately, you have your three buckets. You have your next steps, your problems, and your solutions, and ask GPT to fit all of those bullets on one line with a bold header at the beginning of each. And that is how you make your emails hyper skimmable, because it is so satisfying for a prospect. When most salespeople send an email that is littered with misspellings and a million pages long, They see a very clean recap email with exactly what they need to do in two bullets. They see the exact problems that they have in three bullets, one line each, and then they see the exact way you solve those problems in three bullets, one line each as well, and they can just skim the bullets to know exactly what is going on. So give chat g b t that constraint, and then just give it the information it needs to write that email instead of you trying to reduce it by two words for three hours, which is the case that I've been in. Before we move to the last section, folks, if you want, we'll put a link in the description and show notes, a recap email template that we have that folks can use. But, let's finish this out with segment number six. Number six, which is coaching. One belief that I know you've shared with me is, like, every sales rep deserves to get some degree of coaching, and AI can give them one literally in their pocket. So talk to me about AI sales call coaching. What we've done is we took all the the transcripts of the best salespeople in Lucia in the last six months. It's about, like, 1,000 transcripts. We upload it into a custom GPT, and we tell the GPT, this is how you sell Lucia. And now you have an agent that knows how to sell the product, that know how to handle objections, and like to really figure out the best way to match the customer pains. And then I think you can do a lot of things with it. The first thing is when you have a new rep and he's just onboarding to the company, he can use this agent to really understand how we need to pitch, and even during a good conversation, if a customer asks something that he didn't know how to answer, he can ask the GPT live and get answers. So it can really be your coach in onboarding and during conversations. The next step is if you want to automate that, what we've done is we did, like, a coach review after every meeting. So every meeting that just ended, we downloaded the transcript, we sent it to the GPT, and we asked it, like, what can we do better or how can we do better in this conversation? And you can even get a score, like, six out of ten, seven out of 10 with sections. And if you do it with automation and you save it, over the time, you can see a rep and how he the score is increases or decreases or something needs to happen there, and you can even see in which areas it doesn't work well in the opening, in the action items, like, anything. It takes a little bit more time, but it's really have a compounding effect, and you can coach all your reps simultaneously and all the conversations all day long, which is something that can never be done with a human being coach. It has different capabilities, but it cannot do the scale that this kind of system can do for you and and save the the scoring. So that's really worked well for us. And and this agent, if you think about it, is basically learn from kind of a crowdsource, like, from a lot of people simultaneously. And it's a very powerful thing to do to train your people. So I imagine that you've done this for maybe cold calling, maybe for discovery calls, other things like that. Could you give an example of, like, if I wanted to build my own call coaching GPT or, like, a scorecard? I know a lot of this is, like, figuring out what makes a good call in the first place. What are the example things that I would pull out of a call just to give us some examples of, like, oh, good calls typically go like this, not like this. Are there example, like, elements that are frequently coached in calls? What we have done, we segment the conversation to topics. So there is the opening, the general description, and there is the values the value of the platform. There are specific features. There is for example, we're working with data. So it's data, compliance, privacy, all this kind of stuff. And for each one of them, the GPT knows how to pitch it in the best way and how to handle those top objections and questions that arise from customer. And then it can match, like, the answer that the the rep is given and to compare it and give it a score. It takes some refinement, and the rev ops team are the ones who build it internally in Lucia. So, like, they build the scoring a bit and they trained it. But after a period of time, I think you can get into a point that it's give you a pretty good direction of what you need to improve because it's it's like, the things that repeated are the ones that you need to probably fix first. So if I wanted to build this myself, what I might do is I would plug in all of the transcripts of these 20 closed one deals all the way from the beginning. And then I'd be like, hey. I think these are the things that are important that go well in a discovery call. Give me that plus five other things that you found in these calls. And then, like, that builds the framework. And then I can just apply that coaching framework to now insert this transcript or this transcript. Is that, like, the general gist if I wanted to build this on my own, how I would do it? Yeah. I mean, it's interesting to to try to build it for your yourself. Like, even a rep has it's better calls and and not good calls, so you might do it for yourself. And if you can download enough calls, I think it can work. I think a rep can do it for himself, but I think rev ops to do it for the whole organization is a much powerful thing to do as an organization. This kind of agent can really get to another level if the revenue operation is adopting it. I mean, because every rep is going to be positioning different feature sets differently or handling objections slightly differently. Different style. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like this is probably one of the most powerful ways as a sales leader to start to unleash or unlock tribal knowledge that might live with certain people or certain sections of the org and get the whole team thinking about it. I'm thinking about when I sold ERP software to law firms. We had, like, 30 different SMEs. Some people that knew, like, the billing element of the software. Other people knew the the general ledger structure and how it could be structured based on the how the law firm was structured. And so, like, my job as an AE was to, like, pull in all of my SMEs. And one of the biggest things that slowed deals down was, like, just trying to get knowledge out of those people's head because, unfortunately, we didn't have a ton of, like, documentation, especially when things got really, really complex. And what I would have loved back then and, frankly, like, what I think the sales leader at that org, if they're listening, could do today is, like, take all of those SME calls and put them in a GPT, and now reps should be able to get very, very fast answers for their customers, which should speed those deals. That that's what I would do if I was leading. So, Yoni, we talked about your six different AI workflows in sales, list building, signals, meeting prep, icebreakers, recaps, and coaching. These are all the things you should automate. I'm curious for you to end this. Is there any part of the sales cycle where you're like, folks, leave that part alone because this is the place where you gotta let your sales reps cook. In other words, what is the line between man and machine that you draw at Lucia? The way we think about it is that reps should spend all day long in front of customers and be the human being in front of human being and build trust. That's the vision. We try to take all the non selling activity, all everything that happened behind the scene, the admin work, the technical stuff, and automate them. It takes time and it's, you're doing it in very small steps. You take some task, for example, meeting prep, try to build it, you iterate and improve it, try to adopt it across the organization, and then you save one small thing and remove it off the plate. And then you take another thing, for example, the recap email, and you do that, iterate that, adopted it, and then you took that from the plate. And eventually, you are taking all the things that are not, being in front of customers and building trust of the day to day work. And it's an iterative process that each organization can do and I think need to start to do even today because it takes time and it really requires learning. Organization need to learn. And you don't want to stay behind. To survive this AI revolution, you need to learn how to use it so each one of the people in your organization can become a superhuman. And superhuman means they spend time with customers and build trust, and all the rest will be taken by AI and will help you do the your work much better. So we basically wanna make salespeople as human as possible because that's the way to build relationship and trust. And AI can do the thing the thing that they don't like to do, which I think can make everyone happy. That's that's how we think about it. Yoni, amazing show. Nick, what's one thing that we can give everyone right now to help them not be the machines, but use the machines? Yeah. We actually partnered with Lucia, and a lot of the stuff that we talked about today, specifically with targeting the right accounts at the right time with the right message, there's a lot of stuff that, like, you don't need to go plug into a GPT. We actually put together a full guide on ways that you can automate this stuff and save yourself a a ton of time. There is a link in the description in the show notes for you to go get it for free. Go check it out. Thank you for listening, folks, and we will see you on the next one.
