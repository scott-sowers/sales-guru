## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to Presidents Club. My name is Arman Froeck. I'm here with my co host Nick Sigalski. And today, we have a world class sales leader. Her name is Christine Nolan, and she is starring in the first ever conference focused episode on thirty MPC because they are back in action. Nick, why should people listen? There are so many sellers who board the airplane on their way back from a conference with a gut full of fried food. They haven't worked out in three days. They've got 87 unread emails in their inbox because they haven't checked their email at all, and their legs, Arman, their legs hurt because for the past three days, they just stood at the booth waiting for prospects to come to them. And I promise you, after listening to this episode, if you implement a third of the stuff Christine talks about, you will get more out of your next conference than the average sales rep does in a decade's worth of conferences. And you shouldn't be eating hot dogs. You shouldn't be eating chicken tenders. You shouldn't be having martinis. A three, a two, a one. You should be eating legs. And what that means is leg day in the hotel gym. Let's get on with it. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost to deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Alright, Christine. Welcome to the show. We start every single interview with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Alright. So the first one is record, listen, rewrite, record, listen. So I'd say here, you know, most sales orgs nowadays have some sort of recording technology. Well, this is super great for listening for actionable follow ups with your customer. It's, I'd say, equally as good for self improvement. So make sure you're listening for what you liked, what you didn't like, and then write down what you should have said. Record yourself saying that. Sometimes I even recommend that people say it to themselves in a mirror, or you could pull up a Zoom and, you know, just talk to your own picture. Make sure that you have it recorded exactly the way that you want to say it and keep practicing it that way. I also think that you can do this if you're a manager or sales manager for interviews too. Make sure you're asking the question the right way. Listen to how you can improve for next time. Great. What's number two? Number two is have an intentional speaking hour. So set up with your friends, set up with other reps on the team, your your manager. But, basically, set aside an hour, sometimes over lunch, where you don't have to talk about something that is specific to your company. It's just casual conversation where you eliminate filler words. So write down what your filler words are. Every time that you say a filler word, you have to start what you were saying over again. So start the sentence over again or start the the topic. You will be surprised at how quickly you recognize your friends, each other's filler words, and you eliminate them and how awkward it is at the beginning. But it's really, really helpful to make sure that you're speaking without filler words and you're speaking intentionally. Phenomenal. What's number three? Round us out. Number three is musical chairs. So when you're at a conference, play musical chairs. Go to the session that, a, you're interested in or, b, you think that there's gonna be a potential buyer there and you wanna try to meet them, get there early, sit down next to someone, start talking to them. If they're not the person that you wanna talk to, if they're not a person that you think might be a potential buyer, or if they're just not wanting to talk to you, get up and move. No one will be offended. It's totally okay to do. Sit down to somebody else. Do the same thing. Start talking. If they're not the right person, get up and move. Now don't do it if they're sitting on the same row. You know, that might be kind of awkward. It'll be a little weird, but no one will notice and definitely no one will remember. Christine, we've actually never talked about the prep process and overall how to manage a conference best. And, fortunately, things are finally opening up again. So you get signed up for a conference by your marketing team. Let's break this down step by step. First is looking at who is potentially in that city anyway or who's in that region. Making sure to reach out to them very casually, hey, I'm gonna be in town. I'm going to this conference. I don't know if you're gonna go. Would love to have a coffee with you a couple of days beforehand. No one wants to meet after the conference. Don't offer it. The other thing you can do is basically if you have been to this conference before, there might be a list of registrations from the previous years. Look at that. Set up an outreach campaign or set up a campaign to get connected to those people who went in previous years and ask if they're gonna go again. There are probably a lot of other people that are doing this as well. So maybe see, did someone at your company meet with someone in the past? Like, really look at what happened in the in historicals. And then start asking, like, you if you're I don't know if you have a top list of accounts that you're working with. Reach out to them. Personalize your your invite. If you have their mailing address, personalized. Handwrite a note. Say, hey. I'm going to this. We wanna host a dinner before the event. Are you going to be in town for this? You're describing a play that I used to use where, normally, when I'm prospecting, it's, hey. I think you might have this problem. My software might help with this problem. Would you like to see a demo, learn more, etcetera? And when I had conference season going on, I would actually use that as the call to action, which was, hey. Personalization thing that I found about you. I think you might be going to this conference. I'm going, are you gonna be there? And that's it. And a lot of times, I'd get no, but at least I had a response that I could turn into, oh, okay. Well, even even if you're not gonna be there, maybe we could talk about this. I'm curious about what that messaging looks like. So you believe that Armond is going to be at this conference, and it's because he's in that city. He's part of a trade association maybe. What when you email him, what are you putting in the subject line and body of that email so that it doesn't come across as just, like, some generic spam of we will be in town. Would you like to meet? I know you guys talk a lot about social selling, but really making sure that you understand who Armond is, take a look at, has he posted anything, what's going on with him, and try to personalize the subject of that email to tailor it to something that he already cares about. So Arman posts that he loves sailing, or you found that out. And you're going to a town that is landlocked. You can put something in the title like landlocked in Lubbock, Texas. You know, do you wanna meet up? We're gonna be there as well. Our CEO is in town. We'd love for you guys to connect. That kind of thing. Just short and sweet, tailored and personalized to to the person. You can ask if they're going to certain events. You can ask if, you know, if you're having an event, you can try to get them signed up for that. You know, I'm making a reservation at this spot. Thought you'd be interested in this. Or, hey. You're going to this. This is a pretty cool speaker that I saw last year at, you know, the Black Cat event. Are you going to this spot? And if so, do you want me to introduce you to the speaker? And you can't do this with, like, the whole list of registrants. You're doing this for the select, the top, like, your ideal customer profile key accounts. Christine, can you talk a little bit about the CTA, the call to action or the intent behind the message? And the reason is you said, hey. We're gonna be in town. Our CEO is gonna be in town. I'd love it for you both to connect. How much, if at all, are you positioning this as, hey. This is going to be a meeting where we try to understand your problems versus, hey. This is a meet and greet. It's just more like a business networking type of thing. I would say for conferences, you always want to position for the latter personally. You can get to the meat of, hey. I wanna understand what's going on with your company, but that's a very selfish view. I think, ultimately, you want to try to educate them. You wanna try to network with them. You wanna try to help them network with network with other people. And then what will come from that is really where you get to the gold of of making these conferences successful. So, Christine, we'll come back to all the things you do when you do get the attendee list and stuff like that. But let's dig a little bit deeper here. So you're positioning these as meet and greets, networking meetings, what have you. And let's say you set one of these meetings off of these emails and you decide to meet them at a booth, in a room, at a conference session, whatever it might be. Talk to me about how do you structure these meetings that you've prescheduled and slowly transition them from warm meet and greet to sales conversation. Yeah. And it kind of blends a little bit of the prep too because somebody who's at the conference is potentially a buyer, maybe they're a user, but there's somebody that is important enough that their company said, hey. You need to go to this conference to learn, listen, to network, whatever it is. Say it's an economic buyer. I'm going to meet with your CTO at this conference. You're reaching out to an engineer, let's say, that's your your user. Do you have a couple of minutes to talk to me about what you're working on now so that I can go into this meeting with your CTO and my CEO and make sure that we're making the most of that time with that person? So try to get as much prep leading up to that as you possibly can. It even matters, like, then when you go into a meeting, you're like, hey. I met with these four people at your company just to make sure that I understood what might be going on. But, ultimately, you came here. You agreed to meet with me. What are you looking to get out of this? Have you heard of us before? Are you dealing with problem like this? Do you just think that we have a cool name and great swag? And if so, great. We do. And, like, I'm happy to give something to you, but what are you looking to glean from our interaction? Because then based on that, I can tailor our conversation to that. That's really smart because I think about the way that I've done this at conferences where I was smart enough to say, k. I need to move past that. Wanna see a demo. Come by the booth. Let's have a sales meeting. And I was intelligent enough to say, okay. Let's just meet. Let's network. But I really struggled to turn a networking meeting into a business conversation where I would spend twenty nine minutes talking with Armand about sailing, but I didn't really have a jumping off point to turn it into a business conversation. And what you're proposing is that you kick off that conversation with, hey. I talked to a bunch of people on your team to make sure that I had a really good sense of what your business was focused on so that it was a productive session for us. But before I go all about myself and some of the things that I learned and stuff we might be able to do together, what the heck do you want to accomplish here? Because if it's you want introductions to people I might know, I can make that. If you want swag, I can give you that. You're essentially getting a pulse check with them to figure out what direction should I even go in this meeting because you don't wanna start pitching if they're like, yeah. I just I I did want a t shirt. Your t shirts look really cool, and I love the free ChapStick. And I would also just say, like, you should never start pitching unless someone literally says, tell me your pitch. If you're bumping into someone, they're coming to your booth, or, you know, you meet them in the bathroom. You wanna have a very snappy, like, hey, here's how we help this. It's your elevator pitch. It's just something to wet their whistle and say, like, is that what you're looking for? Do you wanna talk more? Ultimately, you don't wanna talk to someone that doesn't think that they have the pain that your product solves. Just to tie this one off, to your point, you should not be turning this into an incognito discovery call. That is a terrible taste to put in someone's mouth. You should think of this as a networking event, the best possible LinkedIn conversation you could have with someone, or the best possible referral conversation or warm cold call conversation you could ever have. And so to Christine's point and to Nick's point, one iteration that we've used at 30 when we go to conferences like Dreamforce or Outreach Unleashed, what have you, is we come ready for all of those meetings with a sense of how that prospect is doing marketing. And we just ask them about how they came up with those ideas. Oh, it looks like you've been putting a lot of thought into your brand, yada yada yada yada. And we spend twenty five minutes of the thirty minute meeting talking about them. And then at the end of the five, we might insert a subtle, hail. A lot of the things that you're doing that they're sorta aligned with what we do, I don't wanna be that guy to pitch you over a happy hour martini, but maybe we can chat when we're both back in office and we've had a day back. And you use that as the ability to tee up the sales conversation, and all you've done is you've used your really, really good research. So, Christine, I love what you've talked about as it pertains to that meeting. I have to go to an uncomfortable place, which is the bathroom. Yes. Why it's uncomfortable for you? Maybe we'll circle back at the end after the recording's done. I run away when I see Nick in the bathroom. I sprint away. So how are you turning that into a pleasant experience? So, basically, the way that I've seen a lot of people work conferences, like, it's it's they've never been taught how to how to do it. And it's because we had COVID and a lot of people are new and, you know, you just don't get really into the rhythm of things and it's awkward. Like, you're running into people that you don't know. It's like, you know, some sort of weird blind date situation on a on a mega scale. So when I'm going into a conference and I have all my reps do this and I have reps that, you know, just work at the company, You have, like, a hit list. Who do I want to meet? Who do I know is coming here coming back to that that list of registrants? I know that they're here. What I actually do is I take a screenshot of their LinkedIn and I create a Google Doc with it. So I have their name. I have who they are, their picture, a little blurb about them. And then I circulate that with everyone that is at the conference who works for my company. And then I say, okay. Here's who I wanna talk to. And then I on my phone, I look it up. I'm like, set them, set them, set them. When you spot them, don't be like a creepy stalker, but try to figure out a way to casually interact with them. And when I was making the joke about the bathroom, it's that sometimes you the best place to meet someone is like you're washing your hands after going to the bathroom. And this may not be true in men's bathrooms, but in ladies bathrooms in hotels, there are often like little couches and people go in there and sit oh, yeah. It's a whole thing. There are couches and mirrors and things like that, so you're wondering why people are taking so long in the bathroom. If you see someone who you wanna talk to, go to the bathroom. Don't follow them immediately, but go into the bathroom, sit on the couch, go wash your hands, go fix your makeup, go do whatever you need to do to stall while they actually go to the bathroom. And then you chat with them and you're like, hey, how's it going? Are you enjoying the conference? Like, nobody's gonna ever wanna go to the bathroom with me at a conference again. They're gonna see right through me now. But you look at them and you're like, oh, hey, Nick. Funny meeting you here in the men's bathroom. Oh, I really enjoyed that post that you you made last week on on LinkedIn. You know, I think it's really cool how you guys are dealing with such and such problem. I'm Christine, by the way. Sorry to meet you this way, but, you know, I'd love to have a a chat. You know, maybe we can get a drink at some point later in the conference. You can decide how hard to come on based on their reaction to you meeting them in the bathroom. But I would just say, like, use that interaction that way of, like, casually meeting someone throughout the entire conference. You know who you're trying to talk to. You try to find opportunities to to make that happen. There are all sorts of uncomfortable jokes I could make about the bad experience you would have if Armand were your prospect. But I'm far more mature than that, and I won't make any of those jokes. But this concept does extend to all these other areas. What you're doing, Christine, is you're engineering these different areas where, like you talked about with the musical chairs, You're you're creating ways to have casual interactions with people. I talked to so many salespeople who spend the entire time standing at the booth waiting for prospects to come to them. And what ends up happening, you end up being right. You end up being known as the person who, oh, this person, like, had a great conversation with them when we were washing our hands, and we were in line for the buffet, and you struck up conversation with me. Nick's a cool person, which people don't always say. But what you're doing is you're creating opportunities to have real natural casual interactions, not this buyer seller booth and booth wanderer. Talk to me about the things you're doing maybe in the more, like, nightlife bar side of things, because you mentioned that's another way that you're getting meetings. Happy hours, I think, you know, they're coming back, and it's a great way to meet people. And I was at a happy hour recently with an investment firm. I hadn't been to one in a while. And I was like, oh gosh. This is awkward. I don't know anyone. It's a massive space, mostly older men. And I have to figure out who I wanna talk to and who I wanna, you know, potentially meet and follow-up with later. So then, of course, I remembered, oh, right. You're not at a happy hour to drink. And I will say that about, like, any work event. And I say this to my junior reps and they're like, what? But I don't get free drinks. You are at the events. You're at the happy hours. You're at the dinners so that you can meet someone, sell to someone, go to president's club, drink with your friends, eat wonderful food with your family, with your friends, so that you don't have to do it again when you're meeting people. So you're at a happy hour. Do not drink, but get many drinks. So go to the bar, order a drink, chat with people around you. Have a sip. They're not the right people. Nice to meet you. Goodbye. Go put your drink down. It's a happy hour. They're free. Or, you know, if it's your company, expend some drinks. Go back up to the bar. A different side. Talk to some people. Order the drink. Oh, what are you drinking? Oh, I love that drink. I'll get one of the same. How is the conference going? Shut up a conversation. Go back. Dunk your drink. I would also say the same for food lines and buffets like eat before, Don't go there hungry. Try not to be putting food in your face while you're trying to have a conversation with someone. Like, go and get a Subway sandwich. I had to pick that one up, Christine, because Arman will tell you I'm a very messy eater. And I realized it was a really terrible look to have chicken wing sauce dribbling down my suit when I was trying to have a conversation. But you are right. The reason that you are at these events is this is a business event. I'm trying to fill my pipelines so that I can go to president's club. And it's not to eat a bunch of crummy fried food and drink too much and feel terrible by the third day of the conference. And when you can have discipline around that stuff, you can get more out of one conference than most salespeople will get in a decade's worth of conferences. Nick and I actually used to make bets where we would say we're not allowed to leave. We're not allowed to go eat until we each come back with five business cards. And you can take this exact same approach that Christine is giving you with the Google Doc, which is brilliant. You split up a Google Doc with a friend or what have you, or maybe you have two different territories. And you know these conferences have these really long aisles with booths on both sides. Sides. And what you do is it's like you're getting married. You just walk the aisle together with a friend, and your friend walks the right and you walk the left. And you say, our goal is to have this Google Doc in hand, and by the end of this line, we've each approached at least five people, and we'll meet at the end. So this can be a lot of fun if you're with a Fellow seller, and it gets even better if you have this Google Doc because now you can start to recognize both the companies you're trying to get after, but also the explicit faces of the people that you want to get. So we've talked a little bit about before you get the list. We've also talked about spontaneously different places you can go within a conference. I wanna dig a little bit deeper into the sessions, Christine. So there are a variety of different speaker sessions. Sometimes there are networking mini events or mini happy hours or what have you. Other than the standard conference booth floor, yada yada, are there other magic moments within a conference where you would really suggest reps go there or do certain things at certain times? You wanna pick sessions that you think your buyers might be going to. So, again, if you're going to session, play musical chairs. But then if the session isn't that interesting or if you are not getting something from it, don't just sit there and check your email. Get up and leave. I've been to a couple of conferences where I didn't even have a pass, and so it's setting up lunches, setting up breakfasts around the conference. We did a donut cart with coffee outside of the conference once where it was just, like, basically come and have donuts with us. We didn't have a booth. I worked for a company that was very small at the time, so we couldn't afford to have a big booth. We got so much out of it. So try to find ways to be creative and find ways to work the conference outside of the conference as well. I think the meta theme that Christine is hitting on is a lot of people, they waste their time in these two hour sessions. They sit down for lunch with the wrong people, and they sit there and they stuff their faces for an hour. They stay at a happy hour. They talk to someone for sixty minutes, and it's the wrong person, but it's comfortable. And what you need to do is you need to bite down and get uncomfortable. And if you do that, what you can do in twelve hours at a conference, most people will do in 12 conferences. What that means is if there are two thirty minute sessions back to back, you can go hit four of those. You should hit the first fifteen minutes before a session and then the fifteen minutes at the end of the next one, so leave halfway through. And I'm not saying just be rude and ditch all these sessions, but the beginning and the end are the most valuable parts before the person on stage is actually talking. Go do that four times across the next four hours. You've had 16 sessions that you've hopped across. Go work the floor with your friends and then be done with this thing So then you can actually enjoy the buffet or the happy hour when you're back home or when you're on your own bed, whatever it is. You brought up something that was really good about optimizing. It's a team effort. So have a Slack channel that is just this conference that everyone that is there plus your SDRs back home are in. Because then you can say, hey, Arman, I think I'm talking to one of your potential prospects, Nick back home. Can you look up if he's here or if he looks like this or give me information on the company? So then you're trying to have the the face to face interaction. You're telling Armand where you are. He just happens to come in. You introduce him. Or you have the conversation, and you set up the intro afterward. Like, any conversations and any leads that come from this is all good for the business, and it doesn't have to be only my accounts or only Arman's accounts. Christine, speaking of the things that happen outside of the conference, I've seen different folks take different approaches. One approach is when I'm at the conference, I'm only at the conference, and any comms back to HQ are related to conversations that I'm having at the conference. The other approach is I'm gonna have dedicated working hours at the conference where I manage my customer calls. I take a few calls here and there. So to what extent are you letting nonconference work slip into conference hours, and how do you best manage that? That's a great question. I think that, ultimately, you're trying to optimize for the time that you're at the conference. So, you know, maybe you have an hour before the conference gets started that you're gonna check your emails, and maybe you have, like, a really important call with someone that, you know, you're trying to close a deal or you have a weekly cadence and nobody else can take that call. Or maybe it's someone that you've been trying to get for months and they finally said yes and you're gonna take this call. That's fine. But I would say don't try to schedule time to to work while you're at the conference. I would say do make sure that you're taking care of yourself, you're sleeping, you're still doing exercise, and you're not drinking too much because that can ruin your conference. I think you can meet just as many prospects in the hotel gym as you could at the bar, And that's another way to accidentally bump into someone. Oh, would you like a spot on the bench press, Arman? Christine, this has been one of the most fun episodes we've had in a while. And so sadly, we are running out of time. And so we gotta move to the final question. And the final question is this. We've talked about a lot of really great things salespeople should be doing. Now I gotta ask you about a shouldn't. So last question is, what's one bad habit that you see a lot of salespeople exhibiting that you think that they need to break because it hurts them more than it helps? Oh, I think you gotta make sure that you're keeping the right deals in the pipe. I think that salespeople often this is unrelated to conferences, but salespeople often hang on to something because they think it's gonna be perfect. But if you haven't really found the pain and they're not the right person that you should be talking to, it's better to say, hey. Let's pause on this until we have the right people in place and the right problem that we're solving for you. Phenomenal. Christine, thank you for joining us. Everybody stick around for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Christine Nolan. Number one, you are not at the conference to eat, drink, and talk to friends. Do not eat and drink yourself to death so you feel terrible. Keep your eye on the ball and focus on meeting prospects every minute of the day. Number two, when you preset meetings before the conference, talk to that prospect's team in advance and then present that information to the prospect and what you know about them instead of pitching your solution and then ask why they're there. Number three. Also in planning, you should get all the pictures of the people you think or know will be at the event and put them in a Google Doc and then create organic moments where you can find those people. That might mean walking the conference floor. That might mean at certain sessions or happy hours. That might even mean in the bathroom. You can meet people everywhere. And then lastly, number four, do not sit for an hour next to someone who is not a qualified prospect. Play musical chairs in sessions at happy hours in every spot in the conference. Do not stay in one place. Constantly move and have as many conversations as possible. Nick, how can people help us out here? Well, Christine talked about it. Nailing conferences in the manner that she described requires a team effort. It's sort of awkward to be the odd man out who's really disciplined, eye on the ball at these conferences, trying to actually make an impact.
