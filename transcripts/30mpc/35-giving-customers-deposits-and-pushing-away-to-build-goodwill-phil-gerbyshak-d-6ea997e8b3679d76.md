## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes to President's Club. My name is Arman Farouk. I'm here with my co host, Nick Sogowski. And today, we have Phil Gerbachek. He is the man with yellow sunglasses. He is the man, digital selling strategies, a sales trainer, and a public speaker. Nick, why should people listen? Phil gives us some best practices around getting around gatekeepers or getting partnered with gatekeepers, and also why remembering your customer's birthday could be a great way to get new referrals. 03/02, one, happy birthday to me. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly. The CRM helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again, and you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a field forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive Ghost2Deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Alright, Phil. Welcome to the show. You know we start every single episode with your top three actionable takeaways, so let's get your three. Sure. First one, prepare and practice before you prospect. Get ready before you actually start prospecting. Get everything ready. Practice saying people's names and say what you need to say out loud so you don't fumble in real time. Beautiful. What's number two, Phil? Number two, value over volume, always. So as you're preparing for that appointment with your prospect, find out what they value and make sure you deliver it, which means sometimes you have to recommend somebody else for the business. You can't solve every problem, but when you do, you will have a customer for life. Cool. What's the last one, Phil? Last one, connection starts with happy birthday. First, you gotta add your birthday to all your social media, make it public so everyone can see it. Why? Because connection starts with happy birthday. And if you share your birthday, others are likely to share yours and theirs with them, with you so that you can start conversations and make connection out. So what are you doing? Let's say you wanna break into an account. Are you just saying, well, I guess we're not gonna email these guys until their birthday comes around. Like, how do you actually operationalize that? Great question. And the key to that is it isn't just birthday. Right? But it starts with birthday. That's an easy one for people. Could be an anniversary, could be a promotion, could be anything noteworthy that you can remark on. The key is to start with something you can actually talk about instead of talking about yourself. Right? If I was calling someone that the two of you know, I would mention one of the two of you, making it not about me, not even about the prospect, but about something we have in common so we can start the process going forward. So other than, like, birthday and anniversary, special dates in all of our lives, what other things are you looking at to make it about then? Well, anything that anybody posts, anything that their company posts, anything that is relevant to their job title, anything that's relevant to their industry, anything that's relevant to their location. Right? Anything that could matter to them, I wanna have ready because I wanna find something to connect with. I wanna find something that's of value to them that I can leave with right away so that they see that I'm not gonna waste their time, so that they can see that I'm gonna be a trusted partner and not just someone who's like, okay. So you wanna buy my stuff? Because it's really, really good. Nobody cares. Okay. So, Phil, you you've used this phrase trusted partner. And in the beginning, you said, sometimes that means you might even recommend somebody else, which means you don't get the deal. And I always struggle with this because I'm like, what if my boss finds out and they wanna fire me because I sent the business elsewhere? What should I be thinking about as a salesperson in a situation like that? So here here's what I do. Right? I I ask the question to find out, like, what's really going on in your organization? What are the real problems that you're experiencing? With the person I referred away four times last week, here's what happened. His website wasn't converting at all. In fact, he had typos on there that made it look impossible to do business with him. He had no live chat on there. The his email address was spelled wrong. There were typos throughout the website and no actual phone number even on the website. Well, if he hired me to do his sales, right, because that's what we do at processing results. Right? We run your sales. Had he hired us and I'd sent traffic to that website, they'd have never been able to call us. They'd have never been able to do business anyway. So okay. So get that fixed. Get get that fixed first. Okay. What else do they need? Right? So we talk about that. And the key is uncover problems that are impediments to you actually being successful. I'm not saying apples to apples. No. No. There's no comparison, but I'm not a website developer. You're not gonna hire me to develop your website. You're gonna help me hire me to help you kick butt at sales, to run your sales team. That's why you're hiring me. That's why you're working with process and results. It's not just for your website. That make sense? I think what you're pointing out is a super, super important piece here is you're not just blindly throwing somebody to a competitor. What you're doing is you're almost mapping out what are the steps that someone needs to take in order to have my solution. And sometimes there are steps that they have not taken yet. And you can either go and tell them to take those steps or you can walk them through those and have a book of referrals. When I was selling Acarta, a lot of times we would get deals that were held up because a company wanted to issue out equity, but first, their lawyers needed to draft up their option plans, and they didn't have a lawyer yet. And I was the first person who had a Rolodex of 10 attorneys that I could refer them to to speed up that process, and I knew they were gonna recommend it back to me. And so either way, the deal is gonna get kicked out. It's on you whether or not you wanna put the pieces together and accelerate that deal for somebody who might not be ready today. So Phil and Arman, both of what you guys are doing here is really great discovery. And oftentimes, customers are coming to us not with just one problem that exactly fits what we're able to solve. They're coming with a series of problems that are all interconnected in a way. If I think about your example, Arman, you've got the lawyers. You've got the cap table. You've got trying to get this all organized. Phil, the person you work with had a couple of different problems. And so I'm assuming when you're talking to these folks in a discovery call, you're trying to steer the conversation towards the things that you can actually help with and address. And so how do you steer and direct the conversation so you're talking about your thing as opposed to just, like, tell me all your problems, and next thing you know, they're telling you about how they they're in a failed relationship. We don't wanna be life coaches here. We don't wanna be marriage counselors. We wanna be solution sellers, and and that's important. And how do we do that? Well, we know our solutions, and we know the questions that we need to ask to uncover whether or not they're ready. So we that's where that preparation practice comes in, why it's so important. We have to have ten, twenty, 30 problems that we can solve for. Ten, twenty, thirty, fifty questions that get to those problems that help us there. I call it leading to the solution, not leading with the solution. Right? That's really important. I wanna lead them there. Lead them to that solution so they they can see themselves. Is this a problem worth solving, or is this just a problem that was manufactured? Now part of that, if I take a bigger step back, is they're not a professional buyer, but I'm a professional seller. What do I mean by that? Right? We have a buyer who maybe makes a buying purchase once or twice a career before they get promoted, before they do something else. Whereas I have sold this 10 times, 50 times, a 100 times, a thousand times. However, money I have, right, I'm a professional seller. It is my job to help guide them to be a Sherpa towards that solution. When When they see it, they're like, oh, yeah. That's worth solving. Oh, yeah. That that's a problem. And then I have the credibility that says, you know what? I work with 79 other people this month that had a similar problem, not the exact same problem, because nobody has the exact same problem. We have similar problems, and here's how they solved it. Would you like to know more? So, Phil, I'm not sure if this is something that you do really often, but one of the things you're doing is you're using what we call typically language. Or, typically, when I'm talking to customers, they see things like this, which is similar to your situation. And that's a form of storytelling. A lot of people talk about, oh, you need to tell stories to sell, but very few people can actually break down what that means. So could you give us a sense are you using storytelling tactics throughout your sales cycle? And if so, how are you doing that? I'll give you an example that I can use and a simple way when I'm teaching sailing or I'm doing it myself. And that's what I call the then now how kind of method of that. So then right before before the solution was in place, this was the state. Now after you've seen it, right now, here's the happier state, the better state, more profitable state. And then how did we get there? So then, now, and how. And to your point, we always have to say typically if we've actually solved this problem before because it's never all and it's never none. Because if it was none, it's better than a solution. You know, that's like a disease. We don't want that. Right? We want a solution here, guys. We want something that actually solves problems. So we have to say typically because, you know, your results may vary. Right? All past performance is not indicative of future results. All that other crap. Right? All that other silly disclaimer language. But we say typically because people wanna know. So what is a typical person doing? Because I know I'm special. Right? My problem is not your problem. Your problem is not my problem. We're all special. But, yep, we're not. Right? Typically, this is what a CMO does. Typically, this is what a business owner does. And remember that no matter how well you get along, typically, your customer wants to hear that you have a process. They wanna hear that you have going from point a to point b to point c to point d. They have to know that you have that because if they don't, well, then you're a creative agency. You're not really a problem solver. Right? You're just spitballing stuff up. Then you're a laboratory instead of a system. This typically language thing, I wanna dig into it. I've heard people use it in implementations, when people are asking, like, when should I get on board? What times of the call or what are some example situations where you might use typically language? Well, anytime you wanna reassure someone that they're not alone in this decision, it's a great time to use typically. So you can tell that they're thinking, have you ever solved this problem before for people like me? Great opportunities typically. Have you ever gotten results that have exceeded expectations? Great time to use typically. And then end time, you can sense or that they even say it because sometimes people say, well, what do people typically do? They're looking for your guidance there, in which case, you offer that. You know? Great question. Typically, what happens is, blah blah blah blah, and we do that. Right? Typically, this is what happened. Typically, the next step is that we would send you a proposal and you'd sign it. Typically, then within seven days, we'd get that signature back, and then typically, we'd invoice you, and and our typical terms are fifteen days. And then we stop right there, and then we have to be quiet because we don't wanna say, well, do you need something special? Because then if they say no, well, then they're admitting they're just admitted that they're not special. And what you're doing is you're making them think, there's gotta be something I missed. Right? The Ron Popeil, but wait. There's more. No. There's not more. This is really simple. Typically, here's how it goes. So one of the things that that I'm getting a sense of is a theme with you is you're putting these you call them deposits. Right? And so you're putting in goodwill deposits where you're recommending them to people in your referral network or to competitors or you're telling them stories about customers and giving them best practices, what other places or where else are you giving deposits in your sales cycle? The deposit could just be some encouragement. Hey, Nick. I see you're going through some tough stuff, man. I hope you make it through. I've got one of my former sales leaders that potentially one day I'll do some training for again, where I know he's going through a tough time. So I mean, sure. I'm leaving just a sixty second voice message just uplifting and cheering him on. Great way to leave a deposit. Lead them to the fact that I'm the solution, not even the products and services that we offer, but that I'm part of the solution. So it calls me back, and now we talk about him. So, Phil, one of the deposits I know you've talked about making is being really cognizant of the reputational risk that your buyer is taking. And I I know you've even done this with getting around or working with gatekeepers before. So can you talk a little bit about what that looks like? Sure. So everybody is making a risk by saying yes to you. Everybody. Whether you're at the grocery store, you're talking to, you know, the person on the phone that's answering the phone, or you're talking the ultimate decision maker. Doesn't matter. Everybody's at risk. Because what they don't want is they don't want the next person up to be yelling at them. They don't wanna say, you idiot. Why would you make that connection? Why would you make that recommendation? Why would you let that person get through? I'm paying you to stop that from coming through. So everybody has that. So just say it. You know? Nick, I know it's a big risk that you're talking about. Here's all I need. I just need five minutes of Armand's time. Just five minutes. I promise that's all I'll take. If you get me five minutes, I'm just gonna say these three things. And if there's more conversation to have, I'll schedule more time. And if there's not, it's no problem. But I know that you're taking a risk, and I really appreciate you taking that risk. And then because typically, they'll kick that down the road. Right? They'll wait till there's actual time. In between there is the most important thing, and you have to reaffirm that they made the right decision. It's almost like buyer's remorse. You have to reaffirm, you know what? Hey. Remember, I know you talked about this. You were concerned, but I just wanna let you know, I'm a person of my word. I'm only gonna take those five minutes, and I'll be careful with that. Right? And if you have any questions, any concerns, you know, here's my cell number. Just give me a call. And what'll often happen is you'll get I've gotten that call that says, you know, Phil, Jerry's running five minutes late, and I know you only had five minutes. So he's gonna be really rushed, but I tell you what, if you just take two minutes just to even introduce yourself and let him know that you know he's on a tight time crunch, I'll make sure that I get thirty minutes another time. It's happened to me countless times. I asked for five minutes. I got two plus thirty. I wanna go back to when you say, hey. I wanna tell them these three things. My guess is they're not, well, our company does this. I'd like to sell you our products and services. So how are you doing that in a slick fashion so that you don't come off like a commission breast salesperson? What are the things that executives in that position that decision makers in that position, what are they challenged with? Or sometimes it's a request for insight. So I'm gonna ask the question, you know what? I wanted to see what John had to say about this challenge that I've heard over and over again. And because John is a thought leader in that field, in your industry, in your location, in that position. Right? Whatever it is, because that person is a thought leader, I was hoping to just get five minutes of time to ask them just a couple of questions. And I'm only gonna take five minutes. Be really clear about that. You're either asking for help from that executive, from that decision maker, or you're offering some insight based on, again, typically, executives in this position have these challenges. And I wanna see because if John does does too, I think I can help him. So, Phil, you talked about you're not lying. You're not trying to deceive this gatekeeper. What is coming out of your mouth when they pick up the phone and they say, hello, x y z corporation? Hi. It's Phil. Is John available? Yes. But what is this regarding? Then then I go right into there. I've got a question that I need John's help with, or I was wondering if John was struggling with this because I've talked to 74 other executives this week, and this is a typical problem they have. And if they do, I just like to learn a little bit more. It'll just take me five minutes. Beautiful. You gotta be quiet then after that. Yeah. Because that person is processing. They're assessing all the risk. They're having that. And if they wait too long, right, you can even ask, oh, so were you looking at the calendar? Because it looks like Tuesday would be good for me. The assumptive close. If that doesn't work, then we back into the reputational risk thing. Hey. I know this is a concern. Listen. I'm a person of my word. All I need is five minutes. Just gonna ask this couple questions. That's all I got. But you have to be quiet. You have to be willing to listen and to hear what happens there. Because you might hear a, which means this is probably the fifty seventh time this person's been called today. And you can then say, hey, Jan. I understand. It's been a really long day. What's going on? And let them talk. I got one more question that I wanna ask Phil about because you mentioned, hey. I've got other people who are happy who are doing this. You kinda almost alluded to giving referrals, and I'm wondering if you have any quick hit best practices around customer says, hey. I'm interested. We're close to signing, but I wanna talk to a referral. What does that look like? How do you respond to that to make sure that you nail it? Yeah. I ask the question, first of all, what are you hoping to get from the referral? Is there a question that you'd like to get answered? Are you looking for some confirmation of this? Because I've got a lot of customers that are very happy, but I wanna get the right customer for you. I wanna make sure that I get the right referral for you. So if you can tell me just a little bit more what you're hoping to get, I'd be happy to provide that information to you. And then secondly, I wanna ask them for permission to be a referral. I wanna ask them for permission because I know they're super busy, just like you are. And if possible, I'd like to broker that introduction via email just so that it comes from someone trusted and not from a stranger. You can set it up after that, but that first message I'd like to send. So it would look something like this in that email. Hey, Nick. You said that you would like to find out if there are any Fortune 500 companies in the Philadelphia area that have solved this particular problem with the software, with the service that Phil has. And, Armand, you used our product and used our service successfully. You're at a Fortune 500 company, and you're in the Philadelphia area. So I hope you could spend just ten or fifteen minutes connecting with each other. I'm out. If you need me, you let me know. You know, I'm always here. But if not, I don't need to be involved anymore. And then, Nick, I'll be following up with you in just a couple of days just to make sure that that referral went off or to see if you wanted to talk to anybody else. Really simple. Right? Really simple. But I wanna stay in the middle. I always wanna be part of the solution, not part of the problem. So permission helps me with that. Well, Phil, we've had a great episode. We've talked about discovery. We've talked about referrals. We've talked about being a real person and assessing reputational risk. It's time we move to the final question. So we've talked a lot about I'm gonna change this up on you because we've changed the final question here. We've talked about a lot of things that salespeople should be focusing on related to their sales role. And my question for you is, what is one thing outside of work that salespeople should be doing regularly to help them get better at their jobs? Regularly, you should be reading and listening to books, not just podcasts. The podcasts are fantastic for quick hits and quick nuggets of information, but longer form books. They'll help you for three reasons. One, they help you be a better storyteller because you have to see it weave in and out. Great thing. Really important as a sales professional. Second thing, the reason that books help you is because they help you understand new language, new vocabulary because not everybody talks like you. And the third one, even if it isn't a sales book, and I would tell you don't just read sales books, but do read books, is it gives you something else to talk about to show that you're not just a quota crushing president's club killer. It shows that you have some interest. So maybe it's Jerry Seinfeld's new book. You know? Maybe it's The Prairie Home Companion by Garrison Keeler. I don't care. Right? Just read something else you can talk about so you have something to better relate to your customers with. Again, part of being human is knowing a little bit beyond sales, and that's why I recommend reading books. I love that. Don't be just a salesperson. And, of course, we gotta give you one chance, Phil. Is there anything you'd like to plug before we jump off here? Well, I just say go to processandresults.com. We've got a newsletter that comes out every week with a new sales process that folks can use. We're launching a podcast coming up soon. Lots of stuff out there, and I would say, remember, any sales process can work if you take the time to actually do the work and work it. Everybody, processandresults.com. Actually do the work. The man with the yellow glasses, Phil, here here comes the sixty second recap email coming up soon. Adios, folks. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else.

And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc or grab it in the show notes. Your top four takeaways from this episode with Phil Gurbishek include, number one, figure out what the problems are that impede your customer from signing on to your product and build a network of referrals for those problems. Number two, then, now, how? Then, back then, before it was a big problem, now we're in a much happier state. How? This is how you actually accomplish that. Number three. Anytime a customer is unsure if someone else has had the problem that they're having, that is a great time to use typically language. And then number four, call into one persona for a full hour. Do not switch personas constantly. Practice one persona and get some momentum so it doesn't feel like your first call ever. Nick, how can people help us out here? Alright. Well, you made me think when you were talking about time blocking and best practices around structuring your day because we actually did a whole episode around how to be a machine. So go back. It's located between episodes twenty and twenty one, how to be a machine. We'll see you all next week on thirty minutes of President's Club.
