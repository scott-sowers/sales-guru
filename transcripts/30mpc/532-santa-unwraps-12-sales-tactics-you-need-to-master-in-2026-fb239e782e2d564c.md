## Transcript

Is this your, like, hinge profile? I see you're lying about your height. Great. I I'm not lying about my height. I mean, you do look shredded. Oh, I there's a picture of me on his hinge profile. Okay. So Todd Capone gave me a piece of advice. If the truth won't sell it, don't sell it. Woah. I don't have a hemorrhoid. This is Christmas sales Santa. And on the number one podcast in sales, we've interviewed over 52 of the greatest sellers in the world this year, and we've selected the 12 greatest gifts they've given us that will get you to President's Club this holiday season. Now here's the thing, good old Elf Nicholas, do you know the tactics behind each gift? Well, I know the tactics. I I don't know what's in the bag. He does not know what's in the bag. So one gift at a time across prospecting, closing, and sales leadership gifts, Nick is going to select the gift out of the bag, and he's going to have to guess what tactic this gift represents. Let's begin. Oh. Oh. Wow. That's age appropriate. Okay. So this looks like the game of Operation. This is like a Oh. Hold it up. Okay. So what do you have here? Oh, I see some switches, some knobs. Some might even call these levers? These are levers. These are levers. I know this one. How many levers are there? Okay. Wait. Let's count. I see one lever. Two lever. Two. Three lever. There's four levers. Four levers negotiation by Todd Capone. Okay. The four levers of negotiation are a lot of salespeople feel like they have to hide things or play games with their prospects when they're in a negotiation. And Todd actually talks about the concept of the transparency sale, the transparent negotiation, where you actually tell your buyer the levers that they can pull in the structure of the commercials of your contract to get a better price. And those four levers are, one, the contract term. If you quoted them a $100 on a one year term, you might be willing to go down to 90 or $80 if they would sign a two or three year contract. Two, the volume, the amount that they buy. It might be a $100 if they buy 10 seats, but if they're willing to buy a 100 seats, you might be willing to go down on that price. The next lever is the timing of cash. If they are willing to give you all of the value of the contract upfront rather than doing quarterly or monthly payments, that's something your company probably values also. And then the last piece is predictability, which is one that I think a lot of salespeople are afraid of communicating, but it's true. Your business needs to be able to forecast when business is going to come in, and you can tell your prospect, hey. We're willing to pay you for that predictability. We're willing to pay you in the form of a discount if you can commit to signing by a certain date. And so you're not gonna hide this stuff from your prospect. You're actually just gonna say, here are the four levers available to you. Which one are you willing to pull to bring your price lower? Oh, so that is gift number one in the closing stocking. And so we have three more closing gifts, four prospecting gifts. Don't throw my box. And then four leadership gifts, so Nicholas, why don't you grab your next gift, Sonny? Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a deal forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghost of deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Here we go. Oh. Oh. Okay. And when we first started doing YouTube, you described this as I described it as an appendage. This is your appendage. Correct. Yeah. Okay. And what feelings do you have associated with the appendix? Oh, acid reflux. It comes up. I mean, I I remember trying to set one of these up on my desk to film YouTube at home. So I would say stress, anxiety, frustration. When do you typically articulate frustrations, emotions? A problem proposition? A problem proposition. Yeah. But not any problem proposition because we wrote the cold calling book last year. Is this a cold calling framework? This is a cold calling framework. It is a prospecting gift. A three part triggering problem. It's a three part problem from the cold calling course. So, folks, a lot of people obsess over the perfect cold call opener. Like, should I say how's your day going or did I catch you at a bad time or use a permission based opener? But the most underrated messed up part of a cold call pitch is the pitch itself. Way too often, people are saying things like, AcmeCo is a single source of truth Mhmm. That helps you with compensation management. And no one knows what a single source of truth is because that's a buzzword. No one knows what a compensation management platform is because that's a category. The easiest way to get your prospect to understand what the hell your product does is to explain the problem in three parts. So for example, when I was selling compensation software at Pave, oftentimes, I would break down the problem in the three parts of compensation that sucked in order. So oftentimes, compensation teams would really struggle to find accurate compensation data that didn't look all over the place. Mhmm. And then they would struggle to figure out who they should be promoting. Mhmm. And then once they decided they were gonna promote someone, they had no way to actually, like, communicate what that meant for the employee. So all these compensation decisions were all over the place. That's a three part problem that I can then solve with a three part solution. And so I would say something like, well, Pave integrates with all of your HR systems to help you get good benchmarking compensation data, to help you run your compensation reviews, and to help you communicate total rewards so that all of those problems go away. So as long as you lay out the three part problem in Clarity, you can then lay out the three part solution. This is especially helpful if you have a solution that covers a lot of different things. So for example, if you have an ERP solution, there are like a million things that you do in an ERP software, and people will struggle to articulate it outside of buzzwords on a cold call. But if you can say, hey. We help with all of the scheduling, the tracking, and the payouts, for example, that's one way to break a complex solution into three different buckets. K. Alright. Here we go. Gift number three, baby. He's going deep in the middle. Okay. This one feels a little soft. So, Oh, you're soft. Oh, it's an Amazon package. It's a package. It's an ornament. Oh, that is that is really hideous. And where does the ornament go? It goes on the tree. It goes on a tree. And one may consider that you had to discover. Yeah. What was inside that box? I did discover because it was in the Amazon package. This this is a discovery tree. It's a discovery tree. Thirty minutes to presents and it's club ornaments designed by me. Those are actually, like, pretty hideous. So a lot of times people will struggle in discovery with what we call situational or surface level discovery. And so if you've ever had a prospect be like, why are you asking me all these questions? It's because you're probably asking them a bunch of checklist questions at the surface level instead of going deeper in your discovery. That's the first problem. The second problem is when you start to talk about the technical details and the clicks and how they're doing things today, you tend to get 4 figure problems at best. Champions will say things like I spend so much time in spreadsheets or I've got all of these clicks that I need to do or I really wish I could see these integrations or these dashboards. But the problem is those aren't the things that sell a 6 or 7 figure deal with the c suite. If you want to sell a 6 or 7 figure deal with the c suite, you have to get to what is called business impact or executive problems. Lost money, lost revenue, massive business risk. And so one way to do that is through what we call a discovery tree. There are three layers to problems in what we call a discovery tree. Layer number one is the situation. In other words, literally, how do they do the thing today? Layer number two is the operational problem. What is the day to day annoyance that a champion feels? And then layer number three is the executive problem, and the executive problem is usually a c level risk, emotion, or something that would blow up at the executive level. So when I was selling Pave, for example, Pave would help companies plan their compensation reviews, for instance. The situation is oftentimes people would just be planning compensation in spreadsheets, But that's not a problem. It's literally just how they're doing the thing. A lot of times my sellers would come to me and they'd be like, yeah, we're gonna win this deal because they're planning compensation in spreadsheets. And I'm like, who cares if they're planning compensation in spreadsheets if it's working perfectly? So the next layer, the operational problem, is spreadsheets typically require a ton of time to maintain for a champion. If you have 300 different compensation spreadsheets, you're probably spending hours and hours and hours QA and comp decisions. But that's a problem that's a 4 or a 5 figure problem for a compensation analyst. A chief people officer or a CFO does not care if one person at the company is spending a lot of time in spreadsheets because that's why they're hired. And so what's the executive problem? Well, if you have one person making all compensation decisions across 300 spreadsheets, nine times out of 10 that leads to compensation mistakes. And compensation mistakes are what gets you sued or makes you lose your best employees. And so that's the executive problem. You have to turn the spreadsheets into the time spent, into the risk of compensation mistakes that will get your company sued, and that's how you sell a 6 figure deal, not a 4 figure deal. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Okay, Kringle. Okay. It's time to take your next gift. Why are you Santa? I'm say I'm my name is Nick. Oh. Oh. It's spam. It's spam. But this one's tricky. It's not what you would think. I'm thinking this one has to do with cold email. It does not. How would you compare meat like this to perhaps a a rib eye steak? It's tanned. Yeah. Yeah. Ah, this is going to be the five stage sales process. Yes. There are five stages to processing your meat, Nicholas. And folks, if you have not seen our leadership course with Mark Casaglow, Mark taught us that most sales teams make a massive mistake that is killing deals every single day. And the mistake they make is they run their sales process as a series of meetings. If your sales process sounds like discovery call, demo call, proposal call, negotiation call. You are making a massive mistake and here's why. Those meetings are all things that you are doing. Instead, you should think about your sales process in terms of stages or agreements. In other words, what are you trying to get, not what are you trying to do. So there are five agreements that I typically like to think of in my sales process. Number one, problem agreement. Did they agree that there's a problem? Solution agreement. Did they agree that we can solve it? Power agreement. Did power agree that the problem and the solution are worth it? Commercial agreement. Is the price worth it? And then vendor approval. Did they sign the contract? And you can get all five of those agreements in one call in SMB sales. So at Carta, I would do a one call close where we would do ten minutes of discovery. And if it was a hot deal, we would jump into a five minute demo, and then we would jump into five minutes of pricing, and then we would spend ten minutes talking through the contracting process because it was a transactional sale. But when I was doing enterprise sales at Pave, we might spend five calls alone in solution agreement for one part of the product because I know their compensation cycle is so complex that I've gotta show them five different demos just to get them to realize that the solution can actually support their compensation review. So instead of thinking about your sales cycle in meetings, think about your sales cycle in stages. I I know what this one is. I think I can wait. I think I can feel this one. Oh. What is that? If you ate this entire thing of spam, 33% of your daily sodium times six Okay. You're gonna have 200% of your daily sodium. And you're gonna be thirsty, Santa. And so I think you need a drink that is familiar to you. This is in a crowd. Yes. And this I know this one. This is the cheers. This is the familiar tone. Here's the thing. You can say all of the right words on a cold call, but a cold call is maybe 10% what you're saying and 90% how you're saying it. And so we had the legendary Jeremy Lee Miner on the show who has, I think, over 800,000 followers on Instagram, And he is known for his five types of tonality that he uses in sales. Our favorite type of tonality he uses is what's called the familiar tone because it's especially effective on a cold call. Mhmm. In other words, you wanna make your prospect forget that it's a cold call when you're calling them. So let me give you like a bad example. Mhmm. Let's say that I'm using a good cold call opener, like the permission based cold call opener. Mhmm. If I sound like this, hey Nick, we work with a few other Andreessen portfolio companies. Can I get thirty seconds to tell you why I called and then you can tell me whether or not it's worth your time? I sound overeager. I sound like a telemarketer. I sound too chipper. And that's immediately going to turn your prospect off. And so instead, you wanna sound like you're calling your buddy as if your buddy's super familiar and it's like, hey, hey, it's me. Right? And so it sounds something like this. Hey, Nick. We work with a few other Andreessen portfolio companies. It's, it's Arman, Northwestern. You heard the name tossed around? I wanna sound familiar as if I've called this person a million times. We oftentimes describe this as the hey, buddy tone where it's like, hey, dude. What's what's going on? It's been a long time. And that's how you wanna sound on your cold calls. Familiar, not telemarketer. Oh. Oh, boy. Oh, this is good. Oh. Naked way ISO, or rather, what is it naked up? It says naked why. Oh, I know this one. I know this one. It is why, what, how. Why, what, how? Actually, it's a very simple lesson, but it's probably one of the more important sales leadership lessons that I learned from Patty d, who was a sales leader at Postal, who recently their company got acquired. She's, like, one of the best sales leaders that I think we've met with. When you're communicating uncomfortable change to your team, she taught me about the concept of first explain why that change is happening, then explain what the change actually is, then explain how that change is going to go into effect. Oh, you've been a good little boy. Okay. I got my elf gift. I mean, this is great. This is more gifts than I I get any, any chance. Already feel my hemorrhoid going away. It's Oh. It's called poopy train. The poopy train. If I said, I really have to go to the bathroom and we were only five minutes away from a gas station, what would you say? I'd say, could you hold it? You would say, could I hold it? Make them hold it. Make me hold it. Alright. So this one is your goal when you're showing a demo of your product is to make them envision how they are actually going to use that product and encourage a conversation about what it's gonna be like when they're holding it. If I were trying to sell French bulldog puppies, what I would want you to do, Armand, is I wouldn't want you to look at a picture. I wouldn't want you to see a video. I would actually want you to hold that puppy and feel him wriggle in your arms and lick your your cheek. And, like, when that happens, you're gonna buy the freaking puppy. And you wanna do the same thing with your prospect. You want them to envision and get as close to possible as holding that cute little French bulldog. And so the way that you actually do this in a demo is you're gonna ask them to hold it at times. I'll give you a real example. My team sells our podcast ads on our podcast. And when we're talking to a potential sponsor, we're not just gonna say, great, and you're gonna get half a million ads. We're gonna say great, you're gonna get half a million ads and I guess we've talked about a couple different features you wanna promote like, what do you think we should say in those ads? When they hold how we're gonna promote their product on the ads, all of a sudden it becomes more real. And now is a great time for an ad. If you are liking this content, please like, subscribe, and hit the bell on YouTube. If you're listening to this content, how could you be listening to this? You do not see the beard that I'm wearing right now and so I just sound like a buffoon on a podcast. So please like, subscribe, and hit the bell on YouTube. Back to the show. Oh, ho ho. We can't stop the poopy train anymore. I got a gift. Oh, this looks like some cornbread. Oh, hungry. We got a feast. Give me a hint, Santa. Yeah. What's what's the texture like? It's kind of fluffy, grainy, gritty. Grain? Oh, gritty? Oh, okay. This is hiring. This is a sales leadership one. Hire for trades, not for skills. Oh, we put you in the state of grit with cornbread. I've actually made a lot of mistakes around hiring for backgrounds instead of traits. And so a lot of people over rotate on, I want someone to work for Oracle, or I want someone with seventeen years of enterprise sales experience or I want someone who's sold into legal tech. And the reality is background is oftentimes the worst indicator of what a person is actually like. There are things that can be taught. Industry expertise can be taught. Cold call openers can be taught. Discovery frameworks can be taught. In fact, oftentimes, you have to unteach bad habits anyways. But what can't be taught are traits like coachability, like grit and things like that. And so what Mark Casaglow taught us in his leadership course is multiple ways to test for traits Mhmm. Instead of backgrounds or skills. My favorite way to test for a trait is you take the skill that you wanna test for. Mhmm. For example, discovery. Mhmm. And then you test for a trait while testing for the skill. So if I wanted to test you for coachability, the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna ask you like, hey, would you be open to a role play? Yeah. And I'm gonna get your reaction. Yeah. And I will see immediately a physical body reaction to how someone reacts to a role play in sales, which is something that you really need to do often. From there, I'm gonna run a discovery role play two times. Mhmm. And what I wanna see to understand if someone is actually coachable is, one, are they open to the coaching? Are they open to the role play? But then, two, I wanna see if they can implement coaching. And what that looks like is if their role play is exactly the same the first time as it is the second time Mhmm. To me, they are not coachable even if they are open to it because they do not have the ability to implement change. So what you wanna do is you wanna come up with your top six traits that you're hiring for. Grit, coachability, ability to connect the dots, EQ, executive presence. And you wanna put the first two traits in the hiring manager interview and then the next four across two interviews in the on-site interview loop. Speaking of traits, I've got curiosity about what's in the bag. And I've got generosity because it's a very great Christmas this year. Okay. Let's see. Oh, we got a small one. Oh, it must be a gift card. This is our very first logo from thirty minutes to Presidents Club. We designed this when you and I had full time sales jobs and we were like doing this thing on the side, bootstrapping it. And we were like, alright, like, we can't design a logo. So we we paid I think we paid someone on 5 or $4 Mhmm. To design this logo. It was great. Which, like, I think AI could make a better logo now. We called it the efficient businessman Yes. Logo. Is this a business case? It's a business case. And what kind of business case? From Nate Nasrallah, the one page business case. What a lot of salespeople don't realize is that buying decisions do not get made when you are in the room in front of your customer. Buying decisions get made when your customer is having internal conversations about you without you in the room. And what that means is it is imperative that you empower your champion to effectively socialize and sell why their company should buy your product when they're talking to their executives and their decision makers. Because as much as you wanna fight to get in front of power, your champion's gonna have way more face time and, frankly, more sway than you will as a salesperson. Problem is most champions are not salespeople, and they don't know how to effectively communicate why the company should buy this stuff. And so the wrong way to do this is to arm your champion with a business case as long as the poopy train book with 57 different pages that their CFO, their CEO, their COO is never going to read. And if your champion puts that on their desk, they're gonna get information overloaded and your deal is gonna die because of indigestion of information you're sharing way too much. Nate taught us to put together what is called a one page business case that has five key parts. Part one is a priority driven headline. This is an initiative at the executive level that ideally has like a code name or language their company is using. You wanna attach to something their executives are already sold on. Part two are simply gonna be the problems that you learned that are keeping them from hitting that priority driven headline. Part three is gonna be the recommended approach to overcome those problems and hit that headline. Key here. This is not buy my software. This is what the software allows you to do. Part four is the target outcomes. This is using their data that you build with their champion of where they are now and where they should be able to get to if they implement this approach. And then the last piece, part five, is the required investment. What are the dollars and the effort from their people, the hours from their people in order to implement said approach? And so if you actually wanna go steal Nate's template for this, we can put a link in the, description and give you a gift on this episode if you wanna go steal that. Oh. I'm running out of gifts. Oh, gosh. This is a sleep and sport nasal dilator. This is like a thing you wear on your nose to open up your Yes. Because you can't breathe. Oh. Oh. Okay. I know this one. This is breathing. This is deep breathing. This is presencing yourself. This is Alex Kremer's team meeting process. Correct. Yes. This is the breathing exercise at the beginning of the team meeting. This one is great because so many sales team meetings suck. They put the reps to sleep. They are boring housekeeping updates, and frankly, half the team doesn't wanna be there, and so they're on Slack and email and not zoned in. Ideally, a sales team meeting gets everybody aligned on where we are looking to go, what each person needs to do that very day and week to get there, and the team leaves motivated to go sell. So the way that Alex taught us to run his sales team meetings is the first thing that he does is nothing to do with sales. It is actually a two minute box breathing exercise where he coaches the team through four seconds in, four seconds hold, four seconds out, four seconds hold. And then he runs through that breathing four times through. The reason that he starts that way is that gets everyone present and grounded. They are running from meeting to meeting to meeting. A deal might have just blown up in their face. He wants everyone focused for this very important now twenty eight minutes remaining. Once the team is grounded, centered, focused, he's going into rep shout outs. A lot of reps are like, I don't care about recognition. I just want the money. That's not the truth. It's important to recognize your people for the really hard work they're doing. Pick a different person each week. Pick somebody for nailing a prospecting goal, bringing in a big deal. Focus on celebrating the team because that matters. Then we get into our North Star metrics. Those are things like where we sit today from a revenue perspective and what our goal is. Those are things like what is the pipeline we've built week over week. And so those are the metrics that never change. You look at them every single week with your team. From there, Alex recommends you look at your momentum metric. Pick one metric per quarter that you are materially trying to move with the team. That might be cold calls made if you're trying to change the culture of prospecting. That might be stage one to stage two conversion if you're trying to improve a discovery. Pick one metric and focus on that every single week for a quarter straight. From there, we go into black belt updates. This is where you have an AE who is a leader in terms of interfacing with another department. You have an AE whose job is to go interface with the marketing team to figure out all the conferences we're going to in the next quarter and brief the team on those. That helps your team develop into leaders, and it also takes some work off of you as the sales leader to have all of that information in your brain. And then you finish with what we call the five minute squeeze. That is where you have one rep teach one thing in less than five minutes. And week over week over week, at the end of the year, you've got 50 things taught and that's how you start to build your sales playbook over time and get your reps thinking about the strategy of selling and not just having it come from you. Okay, Nicholas. There's one more gift. One more gift? One more gift and it's in the middle of the bag. I feel I feel two? That was an old envelope. Don't grab that. Oh, what is that? It's a phone. Oh, it's your ID. Where is it on? This is this your, like, hinge profile? This is my hinge profile. I see. You're lying about your height. Great. I'm not lying about my height. I mean, you do look shredded. Oh, I there's a picture of me on his hinge profile. Right. How would you sell this to someone? Todd Caponi gave me a piece of advice last night. He said, if the truth won't sell it, don't sell it. And I just I don't know if I could I don't know if I can get behind this product. But if you had to, you would call that pitching a An offer. Pitching an offer. An offer. Perhaps a blind date. Perhaps a blind date. Pitching the blind date. Selling the date. Selling the blind date. Yeah. Oh. Okay. This is one that we learned from Jason Bay where there's actually some data to back this that we will link in the description. When you are reaching out to buyers, if your ask is, hey. Do you want to learn more about how our product can solve your problem? You are actually leaving meetings on the table. The data shows the most effective call to action when you're reaching out to a prospect to try to get a meeting booked is not do you wanna meet, but it is actually what is called an offer of value. Said differently, it is selling the blind date of what are they going to get out of that meeting with us even if they do not buy our product? Because our buyers have been burned by crappy, poopy meetings with crummy salespeople. And so what you need to do is when you're selling in the meeting, you need to explain, here's what you're gonna get even if you don't buy this thing. So one example of this is if I were a salesperson for Viteable Health which sells health insurance to home cares, my offer might be and so look worst case scenario, I'll be able to take a look through your current plans and what you're paying and and give you a sense if you're over insured. And so even if you don't end up moving to us, I'll be able to point out a couple ways you might be able to cut costs in your current plan which should help the bottom line. Santa, you're so generous. It looks like actually, one of these these gifts spilled out of the bag. Oh. That's a traffic light. My guy outside was blowing up the balloon and I forgot to put this in the bag. What is this for? This is your how you structure your day from a sales prospecting perspective. Yes, folks. The vast majority of people always complain that they have no time to prospect. All you have to do is divide your day into red, yellow, and green hours. Your green hours are your green prospecting hours from nine to twelve. In that block, you want to do nothing but generating pipeline as quickly as possible. I typically recommend having two prospecting block. One hour to hit your cold calls and one flex block to either do more cold calls or cold emails. You can fit customer calls in between the gaps, but realistically, those should be going in your yellow hours, which are the hours from twelve to three. From twelve to three, you still have the energy to get on a sales call, but you're usually not going to pick up the phone if you try to start cold calling at 2PM. So you wanna push your customer calls to the early afternoon. Again, you can still take some customer calls in your green hours, but you are never allowed to remove your one hour dial block from the hours of nine to twelve. And then you have your red hours, which are your admin hours, your non selling activities. I strongly recommend you talk to your manager and you try to push your pipeline reviews after the hours of two and 3PM because three to 6PM are your admin hours where you do all your one on ones, you do your walk and talks, you do your recap emails, you do all of your call prep for the next day, and you do your list building so that you step into the next day with a full list of prospects that you are ready to cold call. In the thirteenth special gift that has nothing to do with prospecting, it has nothing to do with closing, it has nothing to do with leadership, it has to do with how to be a phenomenal human being and a phenomenal salesperson. I'll never forget, it was our first in person shoot, I think, ever. And we always do two recordings with most most guests. And in between recordings, I remember on the first show, Johnny kept praising his company Talkdesk and how grateful he was for the opportunity. And so he paused and in between recordings I was like, dude, like you you're like so grateful. Are you doing that for the recording? Is that just like how you feel about the company? And he looks at me, he goes, gentlemen, I know we have to get under the recording, but let me say one thing. I need to tell you one story. I had just gotten laid off from my last job. I went back to my home and I always go by the same bodega. I'll never forget in my life. I go to the bodega and I asked for a bacon, egg and cheese. He hands me the bacon, egg, and cheese. I tap my Chase card to the credit card and it goes declined. I was so broke in my life. I was so rock bottom that I could not even afford a bacon, egg, and cheese. And Talkdesk has changed my life. And that's what I encourage you to do. So a lot of the times when I talk to reps, all I hear is why isn't my company giving me a better territory? Why aren't my SDRs giving me better leads? Why isn't my product improving faster? And the reality is most of the time, the company is doing everything they can. It's the rep that's the problem. So what you should ask yourself is what are you doing to work your territory? What are you doing to make cold calls and generate pipeline? What are you doing to position your product around the gaps? And that is how you make it to President's Club. And I am grateful that Talkdesk has given me the opportunity to change my life. And so folks, we hope that this show across the entire year has given you a couple of gifts that will help you have a fantastic end of year. And even if this year isn't turning out exactly how you want it to, folks, the beauty is q one is the best time of year to go clean slate. And we wish you all a fantastic Christmas holiday season with your best bacon, egg, and cheese, your best sales tactics, and we wish you a fantastic end to year 2025. We'll see you at President's Club in 2026. Merry Christmas.
