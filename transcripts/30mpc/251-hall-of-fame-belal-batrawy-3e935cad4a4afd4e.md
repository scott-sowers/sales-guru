## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this episode of thirty minutes Presidents Club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sigelski. Today, we have the one, the only, and you better not mispronounce his name. He is Bilal. He is a seven time startup sales adviser and the host of the death to fluff community on Bravado. Nick, why the heck should people listen? Billel's got this idea that movie theaters use to price their popcorn, and he's translated it to the world of b two b. He calls it decoy pricing. And if you wanna figure out better negotiation and pricing strategies, this one's a must listen. Let's hit it. One, two, three. Depth of love. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by TextUs, which helps you move your deals forward faster when timing matters. The fastest way to move a feel forward is to avoid getting stuck in the inbox. And so my favorite way to get on a text basis is literally when your prospect requests a demo, just send them a confirmation text saying that you're looking forward to the meeting, and that opens the text channel for you to call back on it later. Folks, we put an entire guide on how to revive ghosted deals, nudge next steps, and use texting to keep deals moving forward with TextUs. Check it out. It's free in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this. Show up with your deal risks already flagged, so gaps in pain, timeline, or power, and your next move ready to rock. That's kinda where Clari helps is they will show you live signals and risks on your deals in one clean view so you can run your business, not have your manager do it for you and poke a bunch of holes. So we put together a free guide on three plays to get your sales manager off your back. The link is in the show notes. Go check it out. Bilal, welcome to the show. We're excited to talk with you today. Every show starts with three tactical, actionable tips, so let's get yours. The first one is doing number play and word plays in your subject line of your emails. So this is, like, tried and true. You wanna give people a little bit of a puzzle. A classic example of a number plays two or three numbers that are similar, one that's a little bit off, like ten, fifteen, 31,000. And people are like, that's weird. What is that? There's a pattern interrupt there. So you could do that with words or numbers in your subject line. The second one is how to get them talking in a cold call. Right? So think about a cold call in terms of steps. You don't just climb the mountain and get to the top. You go to base camp stage one, stage two. A cold call is the same way. How do you get them from hello to a meeting? You've got the first five seconds, the next fifteen seconds, and then the first minute of a call. Each one is very critical. And I'll break down what you need to do in those first five and fifteen seconds to get them talking early so that it's a two way conversation. Then the third one is decoy pricing. This idea of using numbers to create perceived value. Very classic example, you go to the movie theater, a small popcorn $6, the medium $7.50, and the large is $8. Everybody goes to the large because why not add 50¢ and get that large? It's not because it's a good deal. It's because they inflated the price of the medium popcorn. So that number is wrong, and it makes you feel like you got a deal. And that's just as good as getting one. The decoy pricing thing's fascinating, and we've talked a lot about cold calls in on some other shows, and so we'll get into that. But I really wanna dig into the decoy pricing thing. So I love the popcorn example because I am the king of just, like, getting the XXL popcorn and feeling really sick after. How do I actually put this thing to use? So the easiest way is this. Alright? Never overwhelm people with options. That's the job of the seller. Right? You wanna basically think about it like this. Can I create a board, if you will? Right? Like a bingo board where I always win and the prospect always wins too. The answer is yes. You can. So you wanna create something that's very simple. Think about three columns in every pricing proposal you do. The first column is standard pricing, list pricing, sticker pricing. Inflate it. That is your decoy pricing. You're going to make your numbers look big. Like, this is traditionally what people pay when they come in the door. Then option a is the option, not quite what they want. It's a small popcorn. It's like, yeah. That's a good price, but it doesn't have what I need in it. The options and mix of stuff that you gave me isn't quite what I needed. And then option b is the thing that they want. It's the exact mix that they want, maybe even a little bit more, but right outside their price range, right outside where they feel comfortable. It's like, oh, I wanted to play 20. You're at, like, 24. It's just a little bit more than where I want it to be. The beauty of it is if you get your decoy pricing, that standard pricing inflated, you can show a lot of value for getting the right option, option b, because it's like, oh, well, this is interesting. If we just put in a little bit more money, we get everything we want, and it's still a great price because it's way better than their standard pricing. And now you've created perceived value in your deal just by using numbers, and that's beauty of it. We always think that math is, like, objective. It's not. It's completely subjective. One plus one can be whatever you want it to be if you could spin it right. I love this because where you want them to land is really either b or c, and you're making a as unpalatable as possible. How do you deal with the folks who start to say, well, I don't want option a, b, or c. I wanna start picking apart the features in your package, and I wanna make my own option d, which happens to be closer to options a's pricing, but has more of the features of option b. Well, the beauty of it is even if they did do that, which is rare, by the way, because most buyers are not very skilled at buying. Right? Like, the average buyer does it once a year for that thing that you're selling them. They're not super hardcore and, like, do it on a regular basis to know to do that. But even if you did, you have to set up the pricing in such a way where you went either way. So think about it like this. That small popcorn for $6, it's a horrible deal. It's a horrible deal. It's like they give you a, like, a little cup. Like, it might as well be like the little cup my three year old uses at daycare to, like, drink water. It like, you there's, like, three popcorns in it. It doesn't make any sense to buy. Your option a is similar to that. It's like this is bare bones, and it's kind of expensive. Like, the unit economics of it don't make much sense. But you know what? If you need it, if you need that, like, low functionality option and you're willing to pay a little bit more because it's not quite what you need, here it is. So even if they did that, you still win because, again, you're setting up the board in such a way where no matter where they land, you're getting the deal you want. And because you're anchoring them high with a standard price, then hitting them with something that doesn't quite fit with what they want at a price that doesn't make sense, and then showing them, just chip in a little more. Put in a grand or $2 more, and you get everything you want and then some. It's very hard to resist that psychology. We are hardwired to see that as value. It's just how our minds work, and that's why buy one get one freeze exists. That's why everything is $1.99 instead of $2. These deals have been time tested by marketers in the retail world, and we just gotta apply it to our b to b sales. I'm wondering what happens when you enter a competitive scenario where you've got competitors in the mix. Because it's different in the movie theater. There's only one snack stand. But what if you've got two next to each other? Yeah. There's a bigger answer there, which is like, you're not gonna win the right deals on pricing against competition. You need to have one net deal beforehand, and the pricing conversation is just to button it up. Never think about pricing as the way to win the deal because that's just it's a race to the bottom, and you're not gonna come out with something that you're gonna be satisfied with. And odds are they're probably not gonna stick around long enough for you to feel the celebrations from your team. That's just how it goes. Right? So if you're in a competitive situation but this is interesting. You can use pricing as a proof point. So let me give you an example of what I mean. Pricing is a great tell on how a company thinks about its product. If I price my product on seats and you price your product on feature bundles, that tells you about how I think about my product as, like, a consumption based product and how you think about your product as a value add. You're like, it doesn't matter how many seats you have. It matters what you use those seats for while I'm over here saying, no. No. I wanna charge you per seat. So when you see differences between how your competition prices and how you price, you absolutely one bajillion percent highlight that in your pricing proposal, and you drill that into the bigger story you hopefully shared with them way in the beginning of the whole sales process on how there's a fork in the road. You can go left or you can go right, and they are very different, and here's why. And you use the pricing very better to show them. They're like, that's why our competition prices this way. You either will or will not see that in my pricing because of that big narrative I shared with you earlier. So one strategy that I've heard is if you know you're the premium in the market, never propose feature for feature parity. So never have two packages that are exactly the same because it looks like your apples to apples more expensive. So is that something that you believe is true, or are you doing something else with the feature mix relative to your competition? So the features that you wanna show that make up the bundle of the pricing aren't necessarily things that cost your business anything, but are things that your buyer cares about. It's the weirdest thing where, like, every startup I worked at did their pricing wrong because they price based on their internal cost of sales or the cost of goods, not what the buyer actually wanted. So classic example of this. So one of the startups I worked at, we could spin up an instance for a customer with just a simple click of a button. It costs nothing. One day on one of the calls, somebody was like, oh, could we have an instance for our engineering for the org that we mess around with internally and just do some sandboxing on? And I'm like, yeah. Of course. So, like, how much does that cost? I was like, it costs and I came up with a number, and they were like, oh, cool. Let's include that. And I was like, oh my god. Wait a second. Are people willing to pay for this? And it made all the sense to the world. Why would you want I mean, if the product is good and it solves a problem and it helps them discover bugs, why would they not want it on their sandbox environment where they do their testing? So next thing you know, my next pricing proposal, I included a field that said other instances. Right? And I would say includes up to three, and I would put a pricing number on it. Right? And my competition never did that because they didn't think about that either. But I'm like, it doesn't matter. And everybody internally was like, why are you charging for that? I'm like, why wouldn't I? People wanna pay for it. It's what they want, not what I care about. It doesn't cost us anything to spin it up, but they're willing to pay for it. So the construct of your think about it like this. The construct of your columns is the decoy pricing, standard a, b. Right? That's your small, your medium, and your large. Right? But the constructs of your rows, right, are not necessarily the things that cost your company money internally. They might be things that your buyer cares about that you can either bundle in but make it look like it's a cost, but give it to them for free. Right? So it's like I'm including this in your package. Normally, in the standard pricing, this would cost $600. But for you, Arman, I'm giving it to you. It's part of your option b, but it's not included in option a. And then they're like, oh, so option b is a real value add. There's perceived value from that. This is really interesting because it plays on some of the laws of human psychology and human interaction. And I've seen you post about some other things about that on LinkedIn. Like, I've seen you talk about transparency and using it as a really effective tool in the sales process. There's something called the forgetting curve. Just Google it. Right? It's a known thing. And you break the forgetting curve. You break it by spiking people's attention and doing things that are unexpected. Unexpected things can be silly. They could be funny. They could be horrible, but these are the things that we remember. You want to be unexpected as a seller. You wanna delight them. I cannot think of a better way to delight a prospect than to tell them pricing on the first call without them having to even ask. Literally, right from the beginning when I'm setting the agenda for the call, I'm like, also, if it's okay with you, I'd like to make sure I talk about pricing before we end the call today because I don't want you guessing what all this is gonna be. And you do it in a wise manner. You do it in a good manner. This is the way you tell people pricing from day one without them getting the heebie jeebies. You tell them our base pricing starts at x, x being a very small number. And typically, for people similar to you or some of our customers that are similar to you in size and industry and org, it's usually between this and that, and you give them a range. And people go, oh, okay. Now I got it. So it's giving me some sort of a range. I'd like to be on the lowest end of that range. I wonder how I get down there. Then you follow-up that sentence with, these are the factors, the five factors, the six factors that typically affect pricing. I won't go into too much detail today, but I just wanted to make you aware. That delights people, and you've now set the stage. By the way, those six factors or whatever factors you list, those are the rows in your pricing. So it all comes back full circle. You posted something super controversial on LinkedIn that I'm really fascinated by. You talked about kicking off a demo by talking about something your product doesn't have yet by saying, hey. We're missing this feature. And most people would be like, oh my gosh. You never touched that, but you did it in a really interesting way. Your product is not perfect. They already know it. They're looking for where the holes are. Why not just show them Right from the beginning. And it's delightfully unexpected. You're going to impact the forgetting curve when you do that. And that's half the battle half the battle because that's the core of communication, being memorable, staying in their mind, having the right message there. Starting off right from the beginning, just being like, guys, we're building something that like I talked about, a future state that we believe there's a fork in the road here. We believe this is the right way to go, and other people are going this way. And you kind of agree that this feels like the right way to you. Let me tell you what we don't do on this road. We don't do this. Alright? We like to do this. This is where we put all of our time and energy. And people who seem to get that do very well. Just wanna make sure you feel that way too. You get that buy in in the first five minutes of a call, whoo, and it's gravy when you start showing them all those cool whiz bangy features. If they don't believe in your product anyways, they're over there skeptically looking to see where the holes are. When they finally appear, if you've ever demoed a group, you know there's the characters. Right? There's the champion. There's the decision maker. There's always the skeptic. I like to give that person ammo from the beginning. I like to take the words out of their mouth right in the beginning of the call because the last thing I need is a heckler during my demo. So, Vilil, my question is, I know you do some fun stuff when it comes to your phone openers, and I think you use some of that transparency stuff there as well. Can we go back to what we talked about at the beginning of the interview and break down your cold call and how you start that from the beginning of the sales cycle? What you do in a cold call is you ask them a pure question that makes them realize, oh my god. This person knows my world. It's like as if somebody if, like, a fourth person joined this podcast and started telling us, like, cold calling best practice, they know they know what we talk about. How do they know what our sellers do when we're when we're on podcast together? You want that. Like, what do CFOs say in a room together when they, like, meet at, like, a conference? What are they talking about? I'll give you some precise examples. So, like, right now, one of the startups that I'm working with, they sell a solution to financial advisors. The market has a bunch of tools like this that kind of suck. So the tool that they sell, it helps these financial advisors analyze their portfolios so that they're giving the right investment to their clients. Our cold openers are really simple. We say, our company won the wealth management award in 2019 for this. It's just a proof point. Right? Just a just as, like, a social proof point that then, no, we're not crazy. Then we go straight into them. Like, a lot of advisers are cobbling together five different tools, and we list five of our competitors to try to translate risk capacity, their words, not mine, to their clients. And it doesn't really go so well, especially when clients get emotional and they end up leaving their adviser. Am I wildly off base in saying this sounds familiar for you, or am I just rambling here or both? I love it for both. They're like, no. No. No. You're not you're not rambling. No. No. No. It's okay. That's okay. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you're talking about. I know what you're talking about. And they're like, actually, I've used so and so. We're like, oh, great. That's one of our competitors. What did you like about it? You said you used it? What do you mean used? So you're not currently using it? And literally, that's the fifteenth second that's it's like the first second is, I know I'm expecting my call. Do you have a moment? I promise to be brief. I'm cold calling you. Are you good? You're gonna be okay with this? Fantastic. Yes. Proceed. No. When should I call you back? Sometimes when SDRs will call me, they'll give me these random pain points that are totally off. But every once in a while, they'll be like I'll be like, nah, dude. I'm I'm good. I got it taken care of. And they'll be like, well, one thing when you're trying to get your reps to cold call, we found that seven other sales teams have this specific thing that happens every single day. And I'm like, woah. You you, like, stalking me, man. Like, that and it's weird when it creeps into your day. And it's so hard to figure out what that is. But if you can figure out what that is by doing really good discovery on other calls and then weaving that into your cold call, I'm telling you, it freaking sets you off as a buyer. And you're like, alright. That's a little bit weird. Like, you actually got my interest. Well, Bela, I know we can go on and on and on about this stuff, but we've hit it all. We've hit the edges today. So we hit the edges of negotiation. We hit the edges of prospecting, and we came a little bit into disco, but we didn't hit it a ton. But, man, what an episode. So the last question that we ask everybody is, there are a ton of good habits that we talked about today, but there are also a lot of bad habits out there. And so if there's one thing that every rep needed to stop doing today, what would that be? It's a great question. The thing that I wish I knew to stop doing when I was early on that I'd advise others on this, you know, listening to the show is that the buyer's journey is universal. K? Whether it's a stick of gum in the house, a piece of software, we go through the same stages. And I like things that are universal. Right? I like that. That makes my life easy. The five buyer stages are unaware, aware, consideration, evaluation, decision. Matter what we're buying, we go through those. Do not talk to somebody who's in the unaware state like they're considering your product. Just even imagine for a moment a sales organization stopped calling their prospects leads and called them, like, people who are unaware. Like, nomenclature matters. Right? Imagine that. That would just at least get people in the mindset of, like, wait. This person's never even heard of my company, let alone my product. I love it. Alright, Bilal. Anything else you wanna leave with the audience before we sign off? Please join me on the Debt2Fluff community, guys. That's the place. There's 700 sellers already there. It's totally free. We get it. We're a tribe. Any seller knows the feeling of having the fake dials to look busy, of having their commission check played with, of dealing with a micromanager that didn't quite get that they were putting up numbers, which is the whole point of sales. You're not alone. You're not alone, and you're not crazy for thinking those things are wrong. There's a whole community out there that gets it. Come to a safe space. We're all the same tribe. Let's learn from each other. Alrighty, folks. Everybody get on the death to fluff bandwagon and hang on for a sixty second recap email coming up soon. Cheers. Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with a customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by Nook's. Nook's is the AI powered pipeline engine that researches your accounts, builds your target list, writes your emails, and gets you more live conversations on the phone. Thousands of reps at companies like HubSpot, Seismic, and Deal use Nook's to automate the busy work and prospecting so they can focus on closing deals. Reps that use Nook's daily have twice as much pipeline as their peers, and we put together a guide with our friends at Nook's on how to automate the busy work and prospecting and dialing so you can focus on winning. Go get it for free at the link in the show notes. Your top four takeaways with the one and only below include number one, decoy pricing. You got your six dollar undesirable popcorn. You got your $750 acceptable popcorn. And then you got your $8 popcorn, which is the large. It's just what you need, and it's just outside of your price range. That's how you price software. Number two, in the first fifteen seconds of your cold call, explain why you called, tell them it's a cold call, and then ask a pure question based on the problems you know executives tend to have. Number three, in your agenda, tell your customer, hey. The last thing I want you to do is feel like you left this call not knowing what this cost, and then tell them you're gonna handle pricing before they get off the call. And then number four, use what they want, not what you want, which is seats. Use what they want as the rows in your pricing matrix. Nick, what can people do to help?
