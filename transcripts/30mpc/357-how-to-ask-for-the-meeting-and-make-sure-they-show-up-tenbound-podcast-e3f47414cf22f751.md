## Transcript

Today's show is brought to you by Insightly, the CRM that helps you spot deal risk early so pipe reviews actually drive your number. One question I ask in nearly every deal review is, what do we need to get in our next interaction with the customer? If my rep can't answer that question, the deal has risk, and I have something I can coach to. Now we built a guide with our friends at Insightly CRM on how to run pipe reviews that surface real risk and get deals moving again. And you can get it for free at the link in the show notes. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. How do you lead them to the next step in in the process, which I'm assuming is you're setting up a meeting for later, or are you just, like, trying to get the meeting done right then on the phone? It's very, very, very rare unless you're in a Yelp that you're gonna try to close them or sell them on the phone. God knows where this person is. They might be on the toilet and be answering their phone. And so when you're catching someone in the middle of an interruption, they're they're barely even listening to your pitch, let alone a long winded explanation of even considering buying something. So you always want to do two steps. Number one, validate interest before you schedule the meeting and then schedule the meeting. So after I give my problem prop or after I handle a final objection, I'm gonna remove the pressure of the sale entirely. And when I ask you for the meeting, David, I'm gonna ask you something like this. I'm gonna say, like, hey, David. My my guess is you're probably this thing right this second. But are you open to learn more when I'm not cold calling you out of the blue? Or my guess is you're totally all set, but are you open to taking a look? Not for now, but in case things change down the road. My goal is to get you in the car. K? I wanna take you on a test drive. I'm not trying to talk about financing the car. I'm not trying to talk about all the different things we can do to buy out your current car. I'm just trying to get you in the car. Once I get you in the car, AKA set the meeting, then I can do all of the bells and whistles. I can show you how we can buy out your car. I can show you all the fancy parts of the car, and then you'll be willing to consider all of the processes it takes to buy the car. So if you say, yeah. Sure. I'm open to learning more. I'm gonna be like, hey. Great. My guess is you're a busy guy. It's Monday today. And how does your Thursday afternoon or Friday morning look? So I'm usually gonna suggest ranges, not specific times. When you suggest specific times, Thursday at two, Friday at ten, that means those are the only two chance to land on your calendar. And if you're not free for those, you're almost always gonna hit me with send me an email. So suggest ranges. I I just wanna highlight the preface that Arman said to his ask for a meeting. He had two sort of different examples. He was like, what my guess is you're not gonna buy this thing right now or, hey. It it doesn't always make sense to switch. Even if the prospect is, like, hot to trot, like, this is one where it's like, hey. This is, like, a pretty good fit. They're excited about meeting. I know that Armand is still leading with these statements that, again, they lower the sales pressure and show that the meeting that the prospect is going to be agreeing to is not a high pressure situation. And when you do that, the likelihood of you getting a yes is much, much higher. Even if the prospect's like, oh, yeah. We're really struggling with that. Like, I'd love to meet with you. Lower the pressure and your your your chances of a yes from them are much, much higher. Do they ever set up the meeting with you just to kind of like, okay, dude. I'll I'll set up a meeting and then they don't show up If it's a few days later, how do you handle making sure that they just remember this? Because, you know, it it was coming out of the blue. If you set the meeting zero, one, or two weeks out Yeah. The show rate is about the same. 5354% show rate, which is still pretty bad. Once you go more than two weeks out, it's really bad. It starts to drop in the forties and then eventually in the thirties once you're a month out. Okay. Couple things you can do to bring that show rate up. If you're a top quartile seller, your show rate actually jumps up to close to 75%. So it's the difference between, like, if you book four meetings, it's the difference between meetings and three meetings. Or if you book 40 meetings, it's the difference between keeping 20 meetings and 30 meetings. It's a big difference. It starts to add up. Here's how you do it. So you send confirmation emails. And the data act, sending a confirmation email versus not, inconclusive. It's almost exactly the same show rate. But if you send good con emails, I can guarantee that a good confirmation is better than no confirmation email if the average confirmation email is about the same. So if you set it a week out, you're gonna send two confirmation emails. One seven days before and one one day before. And the key is you wanna include a goodwill deposit in your confirmation email. So for example, if you just announced the 10 bound SDR leader of the year awards, we're a week out from our meeting. My email might sound like this. David, really looking forward to our meeting. By the way, I saw that you just, nominated Nick as SDR of the year for the 10 bound SDR of the year awards. Looks like you're up to great things. Looking forward to it. You're gonna feel like a real jerk if you cancel that meeting because I took the time to research you versus David looking forward to our meeting next week. Here's the zoom at your fingertips. Impersonal, etcetera. Just reminding you that you're about to step into a sales interaction. Instead, you wanna have personalization and research and show that you put some prep into the call to make them feel bad. Then the day before confirmation, all you do is you bubble up that thread. So, like, David, putting the Zoom at your fingertips for tomorrow. Looking forward to chatting. So you need at least one personalized confirmation email. A meeting within three or four days, you just send the one personalized confirmation email the day before, and that's it. Got it. Okay. I'm trying to put myself into their shoes. They've probably got tons of meetings and they show up on Thursday and they're like, look at their calendar and they go, who is David Delaney? Like, I don't I don't know who this is. Cancel. If you're confirming it a couple of times like that with personalized information, what you've seen is there's more likely that they'll go, oh, I I I know what this meeting is, so I'm gonna go ahead and show up. Yeah. I mean, most reps are prepping for their sales meeting to some degree, even if it's a ninety second skim of the prospect's website. And you're already there. You're already, like, doing that minimum prep. Find one thing that you can call out, and so few salespeople will take the time to be like, Nick was nominated. Let me put that in my confirmation email that is you stand out differently than the average rep. Thank you so much for coming on, sharing your wisdom. Thank you, guys. You're the man. Thank you, David. Hey, folks. If you keep getting grilled in your pipeline reviews, try this.
