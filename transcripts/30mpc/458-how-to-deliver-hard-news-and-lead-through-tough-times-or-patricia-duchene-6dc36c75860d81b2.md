## Transcript

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this leadership episode of thirty minutes to the president's club. My name is Arman Farrokh, and I'm here with my cohost, Nick Sadowski. And today, we have someone who was one of our first leadership show guests ever. I think it was, like, episode two or three. She is the CRO over at Postal. Previously, she was the VP of international sales over at Wrike, and she describes herself as lover of the GTM unknown. In other words, what that means is she's had two back to back companies where she started at below 500 k in revenue, and she took it to 40,000,000 plus. And, folks, if you know what it's like to join a company that early stage, it is honestly like buying a lottery ticket. So this is like the person who's won the sales leader lottery twice because she clearly knows how to lead an organization. It is Patty d, Patricia Duchene, CRO at Postal. Nick, why should people listen? So, Arman, to your point, like, when you're at a company going from less than 1,000,000 in revenue all the way up to those numbers, there's gonna be lots of big changes and turbulence, and, like, the team is gonna grow. It's gonna shrink. There's gonna be changes to territories and quotas and comp plans and rules of engagement. And a lot of times, your job as a sales leader is to deliver bad news or have hard conversations with the team. And Patty takes us through not only the framework for how to have those hard conversations, we ran a ton of examples through that. Everything from, like, territories shrinking to, hey, promotions aren't available to, hey, we just had a riff. How do you message things to the people that are still there at the end? And so if you're a sales leader that's wondering, like, how do I actually message and properly frame and keep people excited about being here when there's turbulence and hard times happening, Patty has some really, really awesome frameworks as well as examples in this episode. And three, two, one. Let's roll. Alrighty, Patty. Welcome back to the show. We start every leadership show with your top three actionable takeaways. Let's get your three. So number one is gonna be the why, what, how communication method. Oftentimes as sales leaders, we have this burden to communicate the good, bad, and ugly, and oftentimes change is perceived as the ugly. So mastering your ability to communicate change is really what takes you from, like, mid level leadership and mid level management really into the executive branch and the executive level leadership. So let me break it out for you. So why, what, and how. By default, human nature, we're gonna start with what. So I'm gonna give you an example of doing this starting with what, and then I'm gonna show you how you can do this with the why, what, how. So changing comp plans and changing comp payouts, very normal change. Every company has it at some point. I'm gonna tell you how to do it the wrong way. Hey, guys. We're gonna start paying out on deals after the invoice is paid, not when the deal closes. Rep reaction, not great. So I'm gonna flip this, and I'm gonna start with the why. Hey, team. We heard your asks to be paid monthly on your quarterly commission. I get that waiting for quarterly to be a long time, so we're going to meet your ask to move to monthly payouts. We're going to do this by paying out monthly on invoices paid, not by deals closed. By making this slight adjustment on payment, it's going to allow the business to move faster with more frequent payments so you can receive your results. I just communicated the exact same change. I started with why we're doing it. We're doing it because we're gonna be able to move to monthly payouts. Now I am asking you to make a change. The ask was still in there, but I explained how we're going to do it. And then, of course, you can follow it up with how we're going to do it with finance partnership, etcetera. Boom. What's number two? Number two, the weekly self one by one by one. So the last time I was on your guys' show, I had the opportunity to talk about my executive communication up, So how I communicate up to my CEO around my department's performance, and we call that the 30 by three by three. As a sales leader, I spend a ton of my time reporting to the business how my teams are performing, the good, bad, and ugly. I spend very little time reporting on how I performed personally on any given time period. So this is a recent thing that I've started doing, and it's a recent thing that I started asking employees at postal to start doing. And I figured for a while, I'd say, why don't I actually do something that I've asked others to do? And this is what it looks like. One, what is it that I accomplished this week? The first time I made a pass of this, I couldn't figure out what to measure. I can tell you what I measure now. What did I accomplish? The task that I've closed out in my project management tool, the hours that I spent with my ICs on my calendar, and the hours that I spent cross functionally. They're simple metrics that they hold me accountable to not being over meeting and to actually delivering. The next one, what did I fail or what was my down for the week? Having just reviewed all of my meetings, I'm able to quickly see where maybe I may have promised to deliver something that I didn't deliver. For example, I had a one on one with somebody, and I said I would give them a list by the end of the week. I'm now on Friday giving my one by one by one. I realized I didn't do it. That was a mistake. Maybe I had a partnership meeting fail. My one down. My next one, what am I going to accomplish next week? Now that I've taken a real evaluation of my own performance of this week, I can set a much higher bar for what I hope to accomplish in the following week. Maybe I wanna limit meetings. Maybe I wanna deliver on more tasks. Maybe I have a partnership meeting next week that I wanna prep for or board meeting, and I want it to go well, and I'm gonna sell the vision for our h two or management plan. Today's tactic is brought to you by Attention, which uses AI to capture all of your sales interactions, automate sales busy work like CRM updates, and flag hidden deal risk. So if you wanna avoid ghosted deals, end every discovery call with these three questions. Number one, do you wanna buy? AKA validate if the deal is real. Number two, when do you wanna buy? Validate if it will close this year. And then number three, how do you buy? Validate that they will get you in front of power. We put together a guide on how to unblock the three biggest deal blockers in your pipeline. There's a link to get it down in the show notes. Today's show is brought to you by eleven x, your all in one digital GTM team handling, creating, qualifying, and converting pipeline across every channel. If you are still using stale triggers like congrats on the funding, you're getting blended in with everybody else. The best use unique signals, exact LinkedIn posts, negative product reviews, podcast appearances, and use those as their trigger. And we built a growth playbook with our friends at eleven x breaking this stuff down. You can get it for free at 11x.aibackslash30mpc, or grab it in the show notes. One by one by one. Third tactic. What's number three? Number three is gonna be the lever cheat sheet. I think since 2023, I don't know a single sales leader who would say it's been super easy to sell in this market. I think budgets are getting smaller. The teams that you're selling to are changing dynamically. Everybody's impacted by risk. And so the quickest way to solve for that when you're in a competitive deal cycle is to throw out a discount. Every sales leader I know not only drives sales, but also is a buyer, and it never feels good to be showered by discounts. Mhmm. So I advocate for every sales leader, especially if you're managing junior teams, to create a lever cheat sheet. This is a one pager that equips your sellers with all of the things that they can use to incentivize a deal. It could be discounts, professional services, premium support. You need anything they can use, free seats. And next to it, you're going to outline all of the things that they can ask for in return. The reason why that is so important, and this is really a quid pro quo, is that by just showering a buyer with heavy discounts quickly, it devalues your product and it devalues your sales rep who you need to maintain that peer relationship with with the buyer. Especially with junior reps who may not feel comfortable asking for something, by giving them a sheet, they can very clearly see the relationship between what they're giving and what they may need to ask for. Alright, Patty. I wanna ask you a little bit about this delivery of change that you were talking about in your first takeaway. So the delivery of change, sort of three pieces of it. You've got your why, you've got your what, and you've got your how. In the example that you gave in your takeaway, it was kind of balanced because you had a good thing that change was happening around, hey, the team, you're actually gonna start getting paid monthly. And then there was a maybe not as good, but you're only getting paid when we actually click cash. How does your messaging change if there's really only bad things? An example of this might be, hey, team. Like, territories are shrinking and quotas are going up. How does the narrative change in those examples? I don't think you can sugarcoat it. If there's really no positive, I think that you need to treat your team like adults. You still tell them the why. There's always a why. And let me give you an example of a bad why. A bad why is the business has bigger numbers to hit. The board wants more. We gotta find more. That is not personal. It means nothing to the sales rep. You need to find the why that matters to your team. Let's break this down in a way that where territory, your example, territories are shrinking, why this matters to a team. As you guys know, territories this year are going to be shrinking. They are shrinking because we've had an opportunity to hire more sales reps within our global sales team. There is a possibility now by adding more to our sales team that there's a lot more upward mobility. I'm not gonna lie to you that it is going to make things way more challenging. We're gonna have to get much deeper in our territories, far deeper in our accounts. Let me tell you how we're going to do that. Break out a game plan. I think that a sales leader delivering something that is only perceived as negative, you are going to mitigate the shiver effect by how well you are prepared to show your team a path to excellence in that change. Shiver effect, Patty. The shiver effect? Yeah. You ever gotten really bad news and you're just like, ugh. That's the shiver effect. You never want any comms coming internally. Yeah. There's good, there's bad, there's ugly. I mean, we could talk about reductions of workforce. That's the ugliest. But the shiver effect is real. It's when you deliver something that the immediate impact to the receiver is, ugh, not good. So how can you and the minute the shiver effect happens, I think people stop listening. So how can you get them to listen before they get there? Two things that you did that were really interesting in that sort of reframe because originally, I was like, yeah. There can't be any good in territories getting smaller and quotas going up. Two things that I noticed you did. One, you actually helped frame it as like, hey. The team is gonna be getting bigger, which means there's opportunities for upward mobility. And I didn't even think about that because that actually is a good thing that comes from quotas, territories changing. And then you also it sounded like you were about to transition to, hey. Here's the plan that, like, I've been working on to help empower everybody so that we can all hit that goal. Are there other things that you think sales leaders often miss that are positives for the team, like that upward mobility thing that you talked about that, like Mhmm. They're not including when they're talking about change management with the team? Yes. I do. And I think part of it has to do with how long a sales leader maybe has been in a sales leadership capacity, how proficient their business acumen is. Like, do they even really know why certain changes are happening? I've been really fortunate to work at two bags of bat companies who've started at effectively 0 or $7,000,000 and watch them grow into much larger organizations. So I've been in meeting rooms where I've understood at the very highest level why something is happening, but I don't think that's always afforded of mid level management at, you know, Fortune five hundreds. And I do think that as sales leaders, if that's not afforded to you, you need to look for it because your strength as a sales leader is your ability to get your team on your ship through the good and the bad. There's a lot of organizations, especially since 2023, that have really worked hard to move to profitability and streamline and cut down on costs and excessive expense. And in an effort to do so, oftentimes, your employees feel the impact of that. Less raises, less upward mobility, shrinking teams, etcetera. And at face value, that's really hard to swallow. If you really dig into that as a business leader, not and not with your sales leadership out on with the as with your business leadership out on, you can actually view it in a different way. And the way you can view it is like, yes. We're striving towards profitability. Yes. We are cutting costs. And, yes, that does mean that I can't give my team the compensation increases that I wanna give them because I think they're amazing. I think they deserve it. But what it does mean is I can offer my team stability in an incredibly unstable job environment right now, and I can find other things that are valuable to them. There's nothing that's gonna replace $20,000 on your paycheck. Don't get me wrong. Wrong, but there are other things that are incredibly empowering that you can advocate for and that you can remind your team that they have. Things that we do here at Postal, we're a really scrappy team, but we really pride ourselves in hiring adults and treating them like adults. One of those things is we, three years ago, tried out summer Fridays, and we've never stopped doing summer Fridays. And I can tell you that there's been absolutely no dip in productivity. In fact, I'd probably say we're more productive because we're more militant about meetings. So I'm hypersensitive to how much time I spend on meetings is we like to get shit done. But, again, I think that has to do with business acumen and really understanding the high level why decisions are made the way they are made, and that's not something that's afforded to every sales leader. I wanna run one other wrinkle through this scenario because this reminded me of two different times. Number one was when COVID first hit and everyone was going through rifts. We went through rifts when I was at CARTA. And I remember our CRO, I was a director of sales at the time, our CRO pulled us a new room, and he even looked at me. He's like, there are gonna be SDRs who have to be patient right now because before, we were tripling the size of the SMB team, and we would promote someone in nine months if they were hot. Hot. And now it might be 18 and no guarantee moving forward. And I was like, great. That's the message I'm gonna deliver down to my team. Mhmm. And so if you're in that meeting with an SDR and you're coaching an SDR manager, if you know there aren't going to be immediate promotion opportunities, like, how do you actually communicate that to the team? Do you admit it and call it out and just say, like, yeah. Like, that is what it is? Do you try to sugarcoat it and highlight the positives of stability? Because I oftentimes really struggled when my SDR managers would come to me, and they'd be like, my SDRs are getting antsy. They're at nine, ten, eleven months, and it doesn't seem like there's a role that's gonna be open for the next six. A couple of things on that topic. So first off, don't sugarcoat it. Hire adults and treat them like adults. Even if it's their first job out of college, they're adults. I have a saying as a leader. One, nobody's gonna die at this job. This is nobody's last job. Two, I failed as your leader if I'm shocked by your resignation. There are some benefits, and there's some ways to frame this that do highlight genuine benefits to people stuck in that position, and they are really stuck. You're an SDR on my team, and I've told you that, hey. You've done a great job for nine months. The reality is is that promotion that we've been articulating that should be available to you in the next three probably isn't gonna be there for at least a year. That's tough to swallow. I'm gonna say that to you. What I can tell you, Armand, is that our team is a lot smaller, and it's a lot leaner. And while that might feel overwhelming because there's going to be a lot more work to do, it is going to give you and I an opportunity to expand your scope and to give you skills that you otherwise would be unable to have learned if we had continued growing at the size and the rate that we were growing. If you can give me six months, I'm gonna help you expand your toolkit, and then we're gonna find you a job, whether it's here or it's elsewhere. And we're gonna find you the next job that makes most sense. Because I do think truly in you know, amongst all of the garbage that was involved in some of these reductions workforce, it did put a lot of people in the in these position where they had these really boxed prescriptive JDs Mhmm. Where all of a sudden, they were given an opportunity to kind of go fill these open gaps within organizations and kind of flex some muscles or some skills that they may not have otherwise had an opportunity to do. I was talking to an SDR the other day, and I think a lot of times in leadership, you're told not to promise timelines. And you didn't promise a timeline there, but what you did do is you helped them think through when they should make a decision by. And this gal that I was talking to, she didn't see any slots opening up on her team, and I was like, hey. Like, when do you think that might change? Like, when will you know if the door is closed, if something's and they're like, okay. Maybe a funding round comes in the next couple months. I'm like, okay. So, like, you'll know that in three months. You could either go for another STR job and probably do that for at least six, possibly another twelve, or you could be like, I'm gonna sprint at my shot to get to AE in the next three. And then if it's still, like, nothing in sight after the three month mark, then you can go all in on the next thing. But I think giving people a frame, not necessarily for exactly when they're gonna get promoted, but, like, how long they should think about waiting around oftentimes just eases the blood pressure versus just saying wait and see and having this, like, ominous forever timeline in an estimator's head. You go back to kind of how I was talking about this expansion of, like, your skill set and, like, scope creep that can happen. It can be honestly a great benefit is that when somebody's in that position where they're like, I was really gunning at this promotion and now it's gone, your option, you know, is to go get another SDR job. Being able to flip a core SDR job into an AE is role is really hard. So that person's gotta decide, okay. Do I just wanna go bet on another company? And you have no idea, obviously, what the trajectory of that company is gonna be. Or as a manager, do you own up to the fact that, hey. I can't promise you anything, but I can promise to develop these other skills so that when you go to get that next job, you have a meaningful opportunity to get the AE role. So, Patty, one other thing that we were talking about in the preshow is a lot of sales leaders right now are dealing with orgs that are going through rifts. They are put in this really challenging position where maybe they're not the one actually communicating the rift, that might be done by somebody else, but they have to then go meet with the team of the people that are survivors, and they have to find a way to navigate what the future looks like with those people. And so I guess I'm wondering, like, when you're sitting down with those survivors for the first time after a rift, what does messaging look like? What does your, like, post rift process look like? I like to meet with leadership as quickly as possible. I do not want leaders to go into team meetings or into one on ones without at least having a conversation with me around messaging, gut check how they even feel, giving myself an opportunity to tell them how I feel. Nobody likes to go through a rift. I think the first thing that I'm very clear on is don't especially in a rift, more than any other change, don't sugarcoat it. A reduction in workforce is really challenging on the company in multiple ways. It's it's emotionally draining, and it's tactically draining. There are many teams that probably are, you know, waking up the next day with 50% as many hands on deck, and there's projects that they're scrambling to pick up on in inboxes that are no longer available. So the first thing I do is I call it what it is. It's like this is a reduction in workforce. There are people that were here yesterday that we leaned on that are no longer here today. What would sugarcoating that sound like? Saying lucky ones or, you know, they're gonna get another job. They're great employees. They'll be fine. Making projections about the the people that have been let go, I think, is really tasteless. I think as saying they were incredible contributors to the team. We did a work production workforce right before a huge company rebrand, and it was a tremendous amount of work that went into that. And some of the people who made massive contributions to that were let go in the reduction. And something that I called out very quickly post riff was that we could not have done what we were about to do had it not been for the contributions of those people. I personally feel that I have an obligation to do everything in my power to make this rebrand a success because it was the last big project that these handful of people worked on at postal, and I wanted it to make a meaningful splash. And I do think that if you work for a company where people really feel connected to the brand and to the product and to the mission, that obligation is something that sits very well within organizations and within teams. I had a colleague who was reduced and was told by their, you know, CEO that, hey. Don't worry about it. Like, I'll help you get another job. And that at scale is impossible to do and obviously did not happen. I think that's another example of kind of, like, trying to sugarcoat it of, like, oh, yeah. We'll help them out. We'll make sure they get placed. No company out there is gonna one by one get those individuals new jobs. I've seen rifts linger for a really long time, and it's always this, like, fine balance between being sensitive to the fact that a lot of people are very close friends with these people. They're carrying a heavier workload. But there's a balance between, like, sitting in that and just letting your team marinate in it for weeks on end, and then just, like, accelerating and being like, alright. Back to business tomorrow. How do you start to move the team past it and, quote, unquote, like, get back to business in a sales organization? I have, historically, when we've done reductions, given people a week. Take this week. Typically, reductions happen on a Monday or Tuesday. I don't know why, but that's the way the HR world has decided that they happen. Take this week, sleep on it. Next week, we get to decide what our team feels like and looks like. We're a new org. That's usually the expectation that I put on my leaders. We can be really sad this week, but next week, we've all decided to be here. So let's be here. I personally like the framing of, like, we get to decide who we are next week because I do think that businesses change after reductions, many times for the better, sometimes for the worse. But giving people the opportunity to realize that it might not be the same and that's an okay thing. The leading through the managers is really, really important. Having them set the tone of, like, alright, folks. Next week, like, there's a reset. A lot of times, as a VP of sales or as a CRO in your case, you don't have the ability to fill up the room outside of Monday morning meeting the same way that the managers are. But if you can, like, get the managers to pick themselves up by the bootstraps and, like, show up a certain way the next week, those are oftentimes the people who are gonna, like, help you get on to the next. Absolutely. No. Totally. And they're also the people who can create safe spaces for employees who maybe need to talk through it. They're not gonna come to me. I might not be a safe person, but their manager who they meet with every single day to, like, talk through deals and inspect their demos, that is the relationship that's gonna provide them a safe space to really flush this out and become okay with the change. So let's talk about positive outcomes now. And so if we take the flip of this situation, I've heard a lot of reps say things like, my CRO doesn't even know my name. I remember there was one time I missed a key deal that was closed, and it was like the rep's first deal or was the rep's biggest deal or something. Didn't highlight it. And, like, I didn't highlight it, and I felt awful. And my one of the managers on my team told me, and he was like, hey, man. Like, you missed this one. And, like, my rep was really bummed about it. And that was when I realized, like, every single interaction I have with every single person on my team, to me, there are 30 of them, and there are just so many of them. But to them, that's the one that they had that week, that quarter, that month with me. And so I'm curious. How are you intentionally bringing yourself into the grassroots of the team and making sure that they feel your presence in the moments of, like, good things, won deals, quota attainment, things like that. I am very lucky to work in organizations leveraged a lot of Slack integrations. So I lean on Slack integrations to do the heavy lifting for me and to tell me when I need to react to something. We have a channel that tells me when opportunities are created and a channel that tells me when opportunities are closed. We are a little different than traditional SaaS business. We have our SaaS revenue. We also have something called GMV, which is like a marketplace revenue. And so I track opportunities for both. And by having these channels highlight especially larger value deals and logos, I'm able to start tracking them. And so when they do close, it's much easier for me to see that. I don't have to live in Salesforce because I have, like, three other apps that I spend most of my time in as on top of Salesforce. So I am a heavy, heavy believer in that. I will say I also hold myself accountable on a weekly basis to going through all of those opportunities and making sure that I know what's actually materialized, as well as spending time in escalations. We spend a lot of time as sales leaders highlighting and giving shout outs to reps or to CSMs if you manage post sale as well for winning deals and for closing renewals. But we don't spend a lot of time highlighting the successes that come out of, like, taking an angry customer and putting them back on track, getting through the nastiness. And I think that that's that's something that I've really started to hone in on because so much of specifically the post side, world is just it's a grueling gig. And if you're just highlighting the renewals, I don't think that that is that's enough. That that doesn't highlight enough of the the contributions they make to the business. And that's really where it comes back down to is, am I as a leader, I hold myself accountable to highlighting what I feel are each department's contributions broken out by team. Team. And so for CSMs, it's when they when escalations or when they convert escalations into what we perceive as positive feeling, positive sentiment, win renewals, and when they execute a QBR and we get feedback on that QBR. Those are when I think about case ups. When I think about sales reps, if it's their first demo, they need to know that I know that they did it. First deal closed. And then when they hit target, those are for sellers. Those are the things that I'm really looking for. The hard things. For bigger deals, great sales reps have a lot more people involved. They're project managers at quarterbacks, if you're a sales analogy person, of these deals. I love to highlight when sales reps can navigate that project management skill set. So highlighting when maybe a call's concluded with positive sentiment on a with a prospect and we had a representative from our warehousing team, our agency team, and our product team, everyone felt dialed. They felt prepped. I'm gonna highlight the AE writing point on that. That's a really, really hard thing to do, and that deal may or may not close. But I want the AE to know that they executed well, and I know that they did. So, Patty, when you get one of these Slack notifications, you mentioned that you shout out someone who won an over an escalation or won a renewal, first demo, first deal closed. My guess is you're doing more than just, like, pinging a million people in Slack. Like, how do you actually go about recognizing these people? We have different Slack channels, and I use them differently. Things like quota attainment and the first and then customer notes that highlight someone's amazingness. Those three things, I put in a channel that has everybody in it. That's what qualifies in going you've crushed your quota, you know, two months of the quarter, you close your first deal. This customer just came in saying you knocked their socks off. Those go into a everybody's in it channel. The other ones that I discussed, you know, crushing escalation, closing a deal, renewals, etcetera, meaningful stuff like that, that kind of stuff is going in a revenue specific channel. That is how I view the weighting of them. The firsts, global. Customer is like, you make my day, global. And then The rest of them, departmental. And what about stuff outside of Slack? All hands? We do quarterly all hands. So we do weekly fifteen minute stand ups across the entire company. We're very regimented, but we do quarterly all hands. And at all hands, if someone across the go to market team has hit or overachieved quota, they are highlighted. Promotions, highlighted there as well. Patty, this has been an awesome show. We have to move to the final question, and it is we talked about a lot of good habits that sales leaders can exhibit, but what is one bad habit that every sales leader should break so that all sales teams get a little bit better? One bad habit that I think all sales leaders can break is stop saying that it is their problem or your problem or marketing's problem, but it is our problem. And show your team you mean that it is our problem. For example, if leads aren't where you want them to be by creating an element of cross functional ownership around that lead target. Are you as a sales leader driving productive conversations with your marketing leader to solve that? Or are you blaming marketing in your team meetings for the lack of leads? Change that, and then your team will be far more likely to partner with marketing to try to fix that problem as well. Amazing. Thank you so much for coming back on. Everyone, hang on for a sixty second recap coming up soon. Alright. And next time for a two by two recap from this episode with Patty d. What do you have for your two? So my first one is I wrote down three big reframes that I picked up from Patty on this one. The first one is if you're at an org that is in cost cutting mode that is trying to move to profitability, that often means, like, there's less perks, less promotions, less pay increases for people. But the positive for them is that there's more company stability, and you're at a company that is a bit more stable, which is a value for the team. The other one was, hey. If there's no promotions available right now because the team's not really growing, that's a bad thing. But the good flip side of that is, hey. Me as a sales leader and you as a rep who wants a promotion, but just, like, there's not space for that right now, we're gonna get to work more closely together, and honestly, you're gonna develop a lot more skills than if you were at a massive team or getting thrown to another group because you got that promotion. And then the other one was like, if you're having smaller territories because the team is growing, well, yeah, it's hard to have a smaller territory, but it's a good thing when the team is growing because now there's more opportunities for upward mobility. So those were three reframes, all chunked into my first takeaway there. The other one that I have is when you're having to deliver hard news, Patty was talking about post Riff when you're talking to the survivors, treat people like adults and don't sugarcoat things. You shouldn't be saying stuff like, Hey, the people who are left here, you're the lucky ones, or you know what? The people that left, they're they're all gonna land on their feet. You don't need to, like, make those assumptions about how things are gonna turn out for people. It's better just to, like, deliver the tough news, and you can be a little bit somber about that. And then focus the team on, like, what we need to do from here. Number three. Why, what, how. Way too many sales leaders, when they're delivering bad news, they just say, this is what's happening. Your quote is going up. You want to deliver the why that is happening, and then let the what sit for a second. And then you wanna focus on how we're still gonna make this thing work despite the what. And then lastly, number four, you need to give your time team to sit on a hard decision. But then eventually, after a week, you need to go to your managers and tell them that, hey. Like, we get to decide what team we show up as next week. And if you're ever a second line leader, if you're a second line leader listening, you know that there's only so much that you can personally do inside of a company, all hands, and then people are gonna go talk on the floors. And the number one person who can go and actually make sure that the team is productive on the floor is your frontline managers who are leading from the front, and they're having the one on one conversations with their reps. Alrighty, Nick. How can people help us out here? So this episode actually reminded me of one that we did with Eleanor Dorfman, actually live in studio a couple months ago, where she took us through all of her best practices for rules of engagement or ROEs. And, like, the ways that she thinks about splitting up territories or when there's quota changes, like how she communicates those and stuff. And so if you liked some of the stuff Patty was talking about and, like, messaging changed the team, I thought that episode with Eleanor was really, really helpful. So there's a link in the show notes actually to, like, the YouTube link of that one because we did it in studio. You're gonna have to look at Arman's face for most of that interview. We tried to, like, cut him out and put him off to the side and mostly focus the camera on me and Eleanor, but, there were a couple times that he got slipped in there. But I promise it's still a good episode. Go check it out, and, yeah, we'll see you next week on the show. Best episode ever. See you. Peace.
